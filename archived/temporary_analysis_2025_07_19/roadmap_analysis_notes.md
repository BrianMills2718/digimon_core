## Document 1 Analysis: roadmap_overview.md

### Key Claims to Verify:
- **Phase 1-3 marked as "Complete"** - Need codebase verification
- **Phase 4 "Uncertain"** - Documentation conflicts acknowledged
- **MVRT Tool Selection "8-10 tools"** - Conflicts with MVRT plan's 12 tools
- **LLM-Ontology Integration "Planned"** - MVRT says this should be current focus
- **Multi-Layer Agent Interface "Planned"** - May be outdated per user

### Content Focus:
- Emphasizes SpaCy NER as completed (Phase 1)
- Plans LLM integration as future work
- **TIMELINE CONFLICT**: This contradicts user preference for LLM-first approach

### Status Claims:
- Claims 121-tool vision (need to verify vs 29/121 claim)
- Cross-modal architecture "Implemented" 
- Vector embeddings and provenance "Complete"

### Questions for Clarification:
1. **Tool Count Discrepancy**: 8-10 tools (this doc) vs 12 tools (MVRT) vs 29/121 existing?
2. **LLM Priority**: This doc plans LLM as future, but user wants LLM-first approach
3. **Phase Status**: Are Phase 1-3 truly complete or is this documentation exaggeration?

**VERIFIED**: Found 17 distinct tool files with T-numbers:
1. t01_pdf_loader.py
2. t15a_text_chunker.py  
3. t15b_vector_embedder.py
4. t23a_spacy_ner.py
5. t23c_llm_entity_extractor.py (Phase 1)

14. t49_multihop_query.py
15. t68_pagerank.py
16. t68_pagerank_optimized.py
17. t301_multi_document_fusion.py

**FINDING**: 29/121 tools claim is EXAGGERATED - this includes non-T-numbered components like services and infrastructure that are not "tools" in the traditional sense.

### Tool Status Verification:
- **Tool Status Report Claims**: 29 tools, 28 working, 0 broken
- **Reality**: Report includes core services (identity_service, provenance_service, etc.) as "tools"
- **Actual Tool Count**: ~17 actual analysis tools with T-numbers
- **Quality Note**: Many tools show "Basic Functionality: instantiated successfully" but no functional testing

### Multi-Layer Agent Interface Analysis:
**FINDING**: Detailed specification exists in planning document but NO IMPLEMENTATION FOUND
- **Document 2 specification**: Layer 1 (Agent), Layer 2 (UI), Layer 3 (Advanced)
- **Codebase search**: No agent interface implementation found
- **Status**: OUTDATED/ASPIRATIONAL - not currently implemented

## Consolidation Recommendations

### **CLEAR WINNER: Document 4 (MVRT Implementation Plan)**
**Rationale**: 
- **Aligns with user preferences**: LLM-first, 12 tools, cross-modal focus
- **Most current approach**: Focuses on innovation vs optimization
- **Well-specified**: Detailed YAML workflow, clear tool selection
- **Academic orientation**: Research focus with publication outputs
- **Realistic scope**: Focused demonstration vs grandiose claims

### **Integration Strategy**:

#### **Base Document**: Use Document 4 (MVRT Implementation Plan) as foundation

#### **Add Strategic Framework**: Incorporate decision analysis from Document 2
- **Preserve**: Decision methodology and tradeoff analysis
- **Remove**: Specific decisions that conflict with MVRT approach
- **Keep**: Risk-based testing approach for critical path

#### **Add Technical Optimization**: Include relevant parts from Document 3
- **Focus**: Performance improvements that support MVRT
- **Scope**: Only optimizations that enhance core workflow
- **Timing**: Position as complementary to MVRT, not competing priority

#### **Discard**: Document 1 (roadmap_overview.md) approach
- **Reason**: Conflicts with user preferences (LLM-first)
- **Issues**: Tool count discrepancies, outdated priorities
- **Status tracking**: Keep simple emoji system for new consolidated roadmap

### **Key Consolidation Decisions**:

1. **LLM Integration**: CORE INNOVATION (Document 4 approach)
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash ontology generation as primary feature
   - Theory-aware extraction vs SpaCy baseline comparison
   - Cross-modal workflow with LLM-enhanced processing

2. **Tool Selection**: 12-tool MVRT approach (Document 4)
   - Specific tools listed in Document 4 YAML workflow
   - Focus on cross-modal demonstration: PDFâ†’Graphâ†’Tableâ†’Vectorâ†’Export
   - Skip broader 121-tool ecosystem for now

3. **Multi-Layer Agent Interface**: REMOVE OR CLARIFY
   - **Question for user**: Is this still desired or outdated?
   - **Current status**: Not implemented, purely aspirational
   - **Recommendation**: Remove from roadmap unless user confirms priority

4. **Status Tracking**: Simple system focused on 12 MVRT tools
   - Track implementation status of specific MVRT workflow components
   - Remove exaggerated claims about existing tool count
   - Focus on evidence-based progress reporting

5. **Testing Approach**: Risk-based (from Document 2)
   - Adversarial testing for critical path (document loading, entity extraction, graph building)
   - Standard testing for non-critical components
   - Evidence-based validation with real execution logs
