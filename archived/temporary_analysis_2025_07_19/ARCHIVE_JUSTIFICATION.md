# Archive Justification - Temporary Analysis Notes

**Date**: 2025-07-19  
**Files Archived**: `roadmap_analysis_notes.md`

## Reason for Archiving
These were temporary analysis notes created during roadmap consolidation analysis. All insights from these notes have been integrated into the proper documentation:

### Insights Integrated:
1. **Multi-Layer Agent Interface Status**: ✅ Corrected in `docs/architecture/agent-interface.md` 
2. **Tool Count Verification**: ✅ Confirmed 12 tools, updated documentation
3. **SpaCy Implementation Status**: ✅ Clarified 90% complete with specific missing features
4. **Functional Testing Framework**: ✅ Created `tests/functional/test_tools_functional_real.py`
5. **Documentation Standards**: ✅ Created `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md`

### Status Consolidation:
All status information moved to single source of truth: `ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md`

## Files Updated with Insights:
- `docs/architecture/agent-interface.md` - Status corrected
- `ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md` - Functional testing task added  
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` - Standards created
- `tests/functional/test_tools_functional_real.py` - Framework created

These temporary analysis notes served their purpose and are no longer needed in active documentation.
