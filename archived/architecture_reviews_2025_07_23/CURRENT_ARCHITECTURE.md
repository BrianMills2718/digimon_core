# KGAS Current Architecture - As Implemented

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-23
**Status**: CRITICAL RELIABILITY ISSUES - Development Suspended
**Implementation Coverage**: ~16% of target architecture (19 of 121 tools)
**System Reliability Score**: 1/10

> **CRITICAL**: This document describes the ACTUAL current implementation, which has been found to have **27 critical reliability issues including 5 CATASTROPHIC data corruption risks**. All development suspended until Phase RELIABILITY completion.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT

Following comprehensive architectural analysis, **27 critical failure points** have been identified that present significant risks to system reliability and production readiness.

### **CATASTROPHIC Issues (Data Corruption/System Failure)**
1. **Entity ID Mapping Corruption**: Concurrent workflows create conflicting entity mappings causing silent data corruption
2. **Bi-Store Transaction Failure**: Neo4j + SQLite operations lack distributed transaction consistency leading to orphaned data
3. **Connection Pool Death Spiral**: Failed tools exhaust Neo4j connection pool causing system-wide failure
4. **Docker Service Race Conditions**: Neo4j container reports ready before service is available causing tool failures
5. **Async Resource Leaks**: 20+ blocking `time.sleep()` calls in async contexts causing memory leaks and system freezing

### **Development Status**
- **⚠️ DEVELOPMENT FREEZE**: All development suspended until reliability issues resolved
- **Timeline**: Phase RELIABILITY (5-6 weeks) must complete before any other work
- **Risk Level**: System unsuitable for any important research work until fixes implemented

> **IMPORTANT**: For target architecture vision, see [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md). For reliability fixes, see [Phase RELIABILITY Plan](../roadmap/phases/phase-reliability/).

## Overview

The current KGAS implementation is a minimal viable product (MVP) focused on demonstrating the core document processing pipeline. It successfully processes PDFs through entity extraction to PageRank scoring, but lacks many of the advanced features described in the target architecture.

## Data Model (Simplified)

### Neo4j Schema
```cypher
// Nodes
(Entity {
  entity_id: STRING,
  canonical_name: STRING,
  entity_type: STRING,
  confidence: FLOAT,
  pagerank_score: FLOAT
})

// Relationships
(Entity)-[RELATED_TO {
  relationship_type: STRING,
  confidence: FLOAT,
  evidence_text: STRING
}]->(Entity)
```

### SQLite Schema
```sql
-- Documents table
CREATE TABLE documents (
  doc_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  file_path TEXT,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT
);

-- Chunks table  
CREATE TABLE chunks (
  chunk_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  doc_id TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  position INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (doc_id) REFERENCES documents(doc_id)
);
```

## API/Interface Status

### MCP Protocol ✅

## Summary

The current KGAS implementation demonstrates the core concept of knowledge graph construction from documents but lacks the robustness, scalability, and advanced features needed for production use. It serves as a proof-of-concept for the vertical slice (PDF → PageRank) but requires significant development to reach the target architecture.
