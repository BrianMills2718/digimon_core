Take the claims of success you just stated, add them under `claims_of_success:` in `external_tools/gemini-review-tool/verification-review.yaml`, run `python external_tools/gemini-review-tool/gemini_review.py --config verification-review.yaml`, and summarize the output of the gemini-review. then update the CLAUDE.md to be optimized to implement solutions to all the issues described by the gemini-review. the CLAUDE.md should be detailed enough so that a new LLM with nothing other than the context in the LLM and the files it points to could successfully implement the fixes.
