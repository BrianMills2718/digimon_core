# KGAS Security Framework

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security framework for KGAS development and deployment

## 🎯 Overview

This document establishes the security framework for the Knowledge Graph Analysis System (KGAS), covering data protection, system security, and operational security measures. The framework ensures secure processing of sensitive information and protection against various security threats.

## 🔒 Data Security

### PII Protection Pipeline

#### PII Hashing Vault System
- **Deterministic Hashing**: All PII is deterministically hashed using SHA-256
- **Encrypted Storage**: Hashed PII stored in encrypted vaults with AES-256 encryption
- **Access Controls**: Multi-factor authentication required for vault access
- **Audit Logging**: All vault access is logged and monitored

#### PII Processing Workflow
```python
# PII Processing Pipeline
def process_pii(text: str) -> str:
    # 1. Detect PII using regex patterns
    pii_patterns = detect_pii_patterns(text)
    
    # 2. Hash PII deterministically
    hashed_pii = hash_pii_deterministically(pii_patterns)
    
    # 3. Store in encrypted vault
    store_in_vault(hashed_pii, metadata)
    
    # 4. Replace with hash references
    return replace_with_hash_references(text, hashed_pii)
```

#### Vault Security Measures
- **Encryption at Rest**: All vault data encrypted with AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all vault communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) for key storage
- **Backup Encryption**: All backups encrypted with separate keys

### Data Classification
- **Public Data**: Openly accessible information
- **Internal Data**: System configuration and logs
- **Sensitive Data**: PII and confidential information
- **Critical Data**: System credentials and keys

## 🛡️ System Security

### Neo4j Database Security

#### Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all database access
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on user roles
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeouts
- **Password Policies**: Strong password requirements enforced

#### Authorization
```cypher
// Role-based access control
CREATE ROLE reader;
CREATE ROLE writer;
CREATE ROLE admin;

// Grant permissions
GRANT MATCH ON GRAPH * TO reader;
GRANT MATCH, CREATE, DELETE ON GRAPH * TO writer;
GRANT ALL ON GRAPH * TO admin;
```

#### Network Security
- **Encrypted Connections**: All connections use TLS 1.3
- **Network Isolation**: Database isolated in secure network segment
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall rules limiting access
- **VPN Access**: Required for remote database access

### Application Security

#### Input Validation
- **Sanitization**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **Type Checking**: Strict type checking for all parameters
- **Length Limits**: Enforced limits on input sizes
- **Pattern Validation**: Regex validation for structured inputs

#### Output Encoding
- **HTML Encoding**: All output properly encoded to prevent XSS
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
- **NoSQL Injection Prevention**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Command Injection Prevention**: No shell command execution

#### API Rate Limiting
- **/query endpoint**: 100 requests per minute per user (default)
- **/graphql endpoint**: 60 requests per minute per user
- **Burst limit**: 10 requests per second
- **Abuse detection**: IP and user-based throttling, with ban on repeated violations
- **Custom rules**: Adjustable per API key or user role

All rate limits are enforced at the API Gateway layer.

#### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
| Component | Tool | Frequency | Format |
|-----------|------|-----------|--------|
| **Dependencies** | CycloneDX | Pre-release | JSON |
| **Vulnerabilities** | OWASP Dependency Check | Weekly | HTML/JSON |
| **Licenses** | License Checker | Monthly | CSV |
| **Updates** | Dependabot | Daily | GitHub Alerts |
