# Current Uncertainty Framework - Complete Synthesis

## Core Philosophy

### Everything is a Claim with Uncertainty
**Fundamental Principle**: All outputs from analytical tools are claims with associated uncertainty, not definitive facts. This applies equally to:
- Factual claims ("Tim Cook is CEO of Apple")
- Theoretical claims ("This community exhibits high bridging social capital") 
- Interpretive claims ("This tweet is sarcastic")

### CERQual as Universal Assessment Framework
All uncertainty assessment uses the four CERQual dimensions:
1. **Methodological Limitations**: Quality of the extraction/analysis method
2. **Relevance**: Applicability of evidence to the context
3. **Coherence**: Internal consistency of the evidence
4. **Adequacy of Data**: Sufficiency of supporting evidence

No distinction needed between "factual" vs "theoretical" uncertainty - same assessment process applies.

## Hybrid Architecture Based on Research Validation

### Layer 1: Contextual Entity Resolution
- **Technology**: Transformer-based contextual embeddings (BERT-style)
- **Function**: Dynamic entity identity resolution where context creates identity
- **Output**: Probability distributions over candidate entities
- **Handles**: "Apple company vs apple fruit" disambiguation

### Layer 2: Temporal Knowledge Graph with Imprecise Probability
- **Technology**: TKG with interval-based confidence representation
- **Function**: Store facts with temporal validity and formal ignorance representation
- **Format**: ⟨subject, predicate, object, [start_time, end_time], [confidence_lower, confidence_upper]⟩
- **Handles**: Time-bounded facts, missing vs measured absence distinction

### Layer 3: Bayesian Network Pipeline Scaffolding
- **Technology**: BN with learned Conditional Probability Tables
- **Function**: Model dependencies between pipeline stages for uncertainty propagation
- **Structure**: Nodes = pipeline stages, Edges = dependencies
- **Handles**: Dependent uncertainty cascades, conditional probability propagation

### Layer 4: Distribution-Preserving Aggregation
- **Technology**: Mixture Models + Bayesian Hierarchical Models
- **Function**: Preserve distributional information during aggregation
- **Output**: Model parameters instead of single summary statistics
- **Handles**: Polarization preservation, subgroup structure maintenance

## Configurable Uncertainty Complexity

### Tier 1: Essential (Always Enabled)
1. **Context-dependent entity resolution** (Layer 1)
2. **Temporal validity tracking** (Layer 2) 
3. **Missing data type distinction** (Layer 2)
4. **Distribution preservation in aggregation** (Layer 4)

### Tier 2: Advanced (Configurable)
5. **Dependency tracking via Bayesian Networks** (Layer 3)
6. **Temporal confidence decay** (Layer 2)
7. **Cross-modal observability adjustments** (Layer 2)

### Configuration Intelligence
LLM assesses analysis requirements and configures optimal uncertainty handling:
- Analysis type (sentiment, network, temporal)
- Data characteristics (sparse, polarized, multilingual)
- Performance vs accuracy trade-offs

## Uncertainty Representation

### Enhanced ConfidenceScore
```python
@dataclass
class AdvancedConfidenceScore:
    # Core CERQual assessment
    value: float  # Combined confidence from 4 CERQual dimensions
    evidence_weight: float
    
    # Temporal aspects
    assessment_time: datetime
    validity_window: Optional[Tuple[datetime, Optional[datetime]]]
    temporal_decay_function: Optional[Callable]
    
    # Missing data handling
    measurement_type: Literal["measured", "imputed", "bounded", "unknown"]
    data_coverage: float  # Fraction of needed data available
    
    # Distribution information (for aggregates)
    is_aggregate: bool = False
    distribution_type: Optional[str] = None  # "unimodal", "bimodal", "uniform"
    subgroup_params: Optional[Dict] = None
    
    # Dependencies
    depends_on: Optional[List[str]] = None
    context_strength: Optional[float] = None
```

### Fuzzy Categorization as Default
All categorical outputs return probability distributions:
```python
# Instead of: sentiment = "positive"
# Use: sentiment = {"positive": 0.6, "negative": 0.3, "neutral": 0.1}

# Instead of: community = "climate_activist" 
# Use: communities = {"climate": 0.4, "political": 0.8, "science": 0.3}
```

## Uncertainty Propagation Rules

### Dependency-Aware Propagation
1. **Independent stages**: Multiply confidence intervals (conservative)
2. **Dependent stages**: Use Bayesian Network CPTs for conditional propagation
3. **Unknown dependencies**: Use Probability Bounds Analysis (most conservative)

### Temporal Propagation
1. **Current relevance**: Apply decay function from assessment_time to query_time
2. **Validity windows**: Hard boundaries for fact applicability
3. **Evidence freshness**: Weight newer evidence more heavily

### Aggregation Propagation
1. **Preserve distributions**: Fit mixture models, propagate parameters
2. **Track subgroups**: Maintain minority opinions and polarization
3. **Confidence in aggregation**: Separate from confidence in components

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Implement Temporal KG with interval confidence
- Integrate contextual embeddings for entity resolution
- Basic CERQual assessment in all tools

### Phase 2: Advanced Propagation
- Bayesian Network for pipeline dependency modeling
- Imprecise probability for formal ignorance representation
- Enhanced missing data distinction

### Phase 3: Sophisticated Aggregation
- Mixture model aggregation modules
- Bayesian hierarchical models for subgroup analysis
- Distribution-preserving analytical workflows

## Key Insights from Research Validation

1. **No Single Solution**: Hybrid architecture necessary, each layer optimized for its function
2. **Dependency Reality**: Independence assumptions systematically violated in pipelines
3. **Distribution Critical**: Simple averages actively misleading for polarized data
4. **Context Creates Identity**: Not just modifies confidence, but determines what entity IS
5. **Temporal Essential**: Time-bounded validity fundamental to knowledge representation

## Current Limitations Acknowledged

### Partially Addressed
1. **Cultural knowledge asymmetry**: Contextual embeddings help but no explicit bias calibration
2. **Cross-modal observability**: MCAR/MAR/MNAR framework provides structure
3. **Computational trade-offs**: Offline/online separation but need approximation techniques

### Unaddressed
1. **Synthetic content uncertainty**: No framework for authenticity doubt propagation
2. **Recursive theory refinement**: No bootstrap confidence methodology
3. **Human-AI calibration divergence**: No framework when AI outperforms humans
4. **Real-time approximations**: Need efficient algorithms for complex uncertainty

## Validation Strategy

### Mechanical Turk Comparison
- Compare LLM uncertainty assessments to human expert judgments
- Accept that LLMs may outperform humans (research finding, not validation failure)
- Focus on consistency, reasoning quality, and calibration

### Calibration Testing
- 80% confidence should equal 80% accuracy across domains
- Test pipeline uncertainty propagation accuracy
- Validate aggregation preserves true distributional patterns

### Edge Case Robustness
- Test on synthetic content, multilingual data, sparse networks
- Verify graceful degradation under extreme uncertainty
- Ensure system acknowledges limits appropriately

This framework represents the synthesis of our discussions, research validation, and practical implementation considerations for uncertainty-aware knowledge analysis in KGAS.
