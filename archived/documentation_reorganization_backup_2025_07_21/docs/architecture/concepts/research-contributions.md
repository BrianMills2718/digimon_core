---

## 2. Novel Theoretical Contributions

### Contribution 1: DOLCE Extension to Social Science

**Innovation**: First systematic extension of DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) to social science research domains.

**Research Gap**: 
- DOLCE designed for linguistic and cognitive engineering, not social phenomena
- Social science concepts like "political influence," "institutional legitimacy," "social identity" lack formal ontological grounding
- No established framework for mapping social science theories to formal ontologies

**Theoretical Advancement**:
- Systematic mapping of social science concepts to DOLCE categories
- Extension of DOLCE with social science-specific constraints and relations
- Validation framework for ontological consistency in social analysis

**Scholarly Contribution**:
- Publications in computational linguistics venues on ontological extension methodology
- Contributions to social science methodology literature on formal grounding
- Open framework for other researchers to build upon

### Contribution 2: Theory Meta-Schema Framework

**Innovation**: Computational framework for representing social science theories as machine-readable, validated schemas.

**Research Gap**:
- Social science theories exist as prose descriptions, not computable specifications
- No standardized way to operationalize theoretical constructs for automated analysis
- Theory application in computational analysis is typically ad-hoc and non-reproducible

**Theoretical Advancement**:
- Formal schema language for theory specification
- 3D classification framework (Level × Component × Causality) for theory typology
- Automated validation of theory coherence and applicability

**Example Theory Schema**:
```json
{
  "theory_id": "social_identity_theory",
  "classification": ["Meso", "Whom", "Agentic"],
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "InGroupMember",
      "mcl_id": "SocialActor",
      "dolce_parent": "dolce:SocialObject",
      "validation": "ontologically_sound"
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "name": "identifies_with",
      "pattern": "SocialObject → SocialObject",
      "dolce_validation": "valid"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Contribution 3: Cross-Modal Analysis Methodology

**Innovation**: Seamless movement between Graph, Table, and Vector data representations with semantic preservation.

**Research Gap**:
- Existing tools force researchers into single analytical paradigms
- No established methodology for preserving semantic meaning across format transformations
- Analysis quality depends on researcher's technical tool knowledge rather than research question appropriateness

**Methodological Innovation**:
- LLM-driven intelligent mode selection based on research questions
- Semantic preservation algorithms for cross-modal conversion
- Unified provenance tracking across all representations
- Quality metrics for transformation fidelity

**Example Workflow Intelligence**:
```
Research Question: "How do conspiracy theories spread across social media platforms?"

LLM Analysis:
1. Primary Mode: Graph → Network analysis for spread patterns
2. Secondary Mode: Vector → Semantic analysis for theory evolution  
3. Tertiary Mode: Table → Statistical analysis for demographic patterns
4. Integration: Cross-modal synthesis for comprehensive understanding
```

### Contribution 4: Automated Theory Operationalization

**Innovation**: LLM-driven conversion of natural language theory descriptions into computable schemas.

**Research Gap**:
- Theory operationalization typically requires months of manual work by domain experts
- Inconsistencies in how theories are applied across different studies
- No systematic approach to theory validation in computational contexts

**Technical Innovation**:
- Domain conversation methodology for theory elicitation
- Automated schema generation with validation
- Ontological consistency checking for theory specifications
- Master Concept Library integration for standardized vocabulary
