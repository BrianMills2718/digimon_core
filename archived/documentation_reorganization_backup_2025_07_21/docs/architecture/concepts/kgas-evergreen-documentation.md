# KGAS Evergreen Documentation

> This document is the single source of truth for the theoretical foundation of the Knowledge Graph Analysis System (KGAS). For implementation status and development progress, see [ROADMAP_v2.1.md](ROADMAP_v2.1.md).

## Theoretical Foundation

- [Theory Meta-Schema](THEORY_META_SCHEMA.md): Defined/documented, integration in progress
- [Master Concept Library](MASTER_CONCEPT_LIBRARY.md): Defined/documented, integration in progress
- [Three-Dimensional Framework](THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK.md): Defined/documented, integration in progress
- [ORM Methodology](ORM_METHODOLOGY.md): Defined/documented, integration in progress
- [Contract System](CONTRACT_SYSTEM.md): Defined/documented, integration in progress

## Target Architecture

The target architecture integrates theoretical foundations with practical system design:

- All phases and tools use theory schemas and contracts for validation
- Full ORM compliance and three-dimensional theory classification in all workflows
- Automated contract validation and theory schema compliance in CI/CD

## Navigation
- [Roadmap](ROADMAP_v2.1.md)
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Compatibility Matrix](COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md)
- [Contract System](CONTRACT_SYSTEM.md)
