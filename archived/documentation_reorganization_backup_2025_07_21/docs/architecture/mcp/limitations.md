## Limitation Categories

### 1. Functional & Performance Limitations

#### The "40-Tool Barrier" - Reasoning Degradation

**Problem**: The model's ability to choose the correct tool and reason effectively degrades significantly as the number of active tools increases (practically limited to ~40 tools).

**Impact on KGAS**: With 121+ planned tools, this creates a fundamental scalability challenge for our comprehensive tool ecosystem.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

**For Users**:
- **Selective Tool Activation**: Manually enable only the essential tools needed for the current task
- **MCP Hubs**: Use community-driven "hub" servers that consolidate many tools or servers into a single, managed interface

**For Developers/Providers**:
- **Improved Algorithms**: LLM providers (like Anthropic) must improve the model's core tool-selection and reasoning algorithms
- **Tool Filtering Mechanisms**: Client applications (like Cursor) can add features to filter or search for tools

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Consider tool grouping strategies (Phase 1 tools, Phase 2 tools, etc.)
- Implement context-aware tool activation
- Design intelligent tool recommendation system

#### Context Window Scaling Failure

**Problem**: Tool definitions consume a large portion of the LLM's context window, leaving little room for the actual query and response, leading to failures and high costs.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Lazy Loading**: A future solution where only relevant tool definitions are loaded into context as needed
- **Summarization**: Manually have the agent summarize the current state and start a new chat with the summary to clear the context
- **Token-Efficient Design**: MCP server developers must create concise, clear tool names and descriptions to minimize token usage

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Prioritize concise tool descriptions
- Implement smart context management
- Consider tool description summarization

#### Inefficient Task Execution

**Problem**: The agent uses primitive tools inefficiently for complex tasks (e.g., reading 100 files one-by-one instead of searching), leading to failure or incorrect results.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Build Higher-Level Tools**: Instead of basic read_file, create an intelligent search_drive_for_keyword(keyword) tool that performs the complex logic on the server side
- **Combine RAG and MCP**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient information retrieval and MCP for executing specific actions

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Design composite tools that handle complex workflows
- Integrate RAG capabilities with MCP tools
- Provide batch processing capabilities

#### High Latency & Cost

**Problem**: Every turn in the conversation requires reloading all tool definitions into context, making interactions slow and expensive.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently used tools or data
- **Efficient Tool Design**: Design tools to return concise, structured data instead of large, unstructured text blobs

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Implement comprehensive caching strategy
- Optimize tool response formats
- Consider tool result summarization

### 2. Protocol Design & Standardization Issues

#### Stateful Design (SSE) Problems

**Problem**: The protocol's reliance on stateful Server-Sent Events (SSE) is resource-intensive, complicates scaling, and can lead to hardcoded timeouts on long-running tasks.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Protocol Evolution**: The MCP spec is evolving to include stateless transports like Streamable HTTP
- **External State Management**: Developers must build their MCP servers to handle state externally to align with stateless architectures like REST APIs

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Design for stateless operations where possible
- Implement external state management for long-running operations
- Plan for protocol evolution

#### Lack of Comprehensive Standards

**Problem**: The protocol lacks strict standards for error handling, tool versioning, and governance, leading to inconsistent and unreliable tool behavior.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Robust Server-Side Logic**: Developers must implement comprehensive error handling and validation within their own MCP servers
- **Community & Spec Maturation**: The MCP steering committee and community must continue to develop and adopt more robust standards

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Implement comprehensive error handling in all tools
- Design robust tool versioning strategy
- Create internal governance standards for tool development

#### Unstructured Text Responses

**Problem**: The protocol is designed for human-readable text, which is not ideal for tasks requiring structured data, rich UIs, or asynchronous updates (e.g., booking an Uber).

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **"Magic Link" Workaround**: Tools can return a unique URL in their text response that the user can click to see a rich UI, confirm an action, or get live updates

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Design structured response formats within text constraints
- Consider web interface integration for complex results
- Plan for rich UI components where needed

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities

#### Prompt Injection & Tool Poisoning

**Problem**: Malicious instructions in a tool's description can hijack the agent's behavior, and a tool's function can be changed after installation (a "rug pull" attack).

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Vetting & Sandboxing**: Only use MCP servers from trusted, vetted developers. Client applications should sandbox tool execution
- **Strict Confirmation**: The client application must enforce strict user confirmation for all actions and re-confirm if a tool's definition changes

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Implement strict tool vetting process
- Design sandboxed execution environment
- Create tool integrity monitoring

#### Tool Shadowing & Masquerading

**Problem**: A malicious server can create a tool with the same name as a legitimate one (write_file) to intercept calls and trick the user and agent.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Namespacing**: The client application must enforce unique namespacing for tools (e.g., github/write_file vs. malicious/write_file) and make the source clear to the user

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Implement comprehensive tool namespacing
- Design clear tool provenance tracking
- Create tool source identification system

#### Accidental Data Exfiltration

**Problem**: The agent can unintentionally leak sensitive data from one trusted tool (e.g., a medical record from Google Drive) to another less-secure tool (e.g., a third-party summarizer).

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Least-Privilege Credentials**: Create dedicated, limited-permission service accounts for the agent to use, rather than full user credentials
- **Fine-Grained Access Control (RBAC)**: Use tools and servers that support precise access controls
- **User Vigilance**: Users must carefully review what data is being sent in each tool call before confirming

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Implement least-privilege access patterns
- Design fine-grained permission system
- Create data flow monitoring and alerts

#### Derived Data / Aggregation Risk

**Problem**: The agent can aggregate multiple sources of non-sensitive data to infer highly sensitive information that the user was not meant to easily access.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Corporate Data Governance**: This is a policy issue. Companies must implement strict rules on what data sources an agent can access simultaneously
- **Purpose-Built Agents**: Deploy agents with access only to the specific data needed for their single purpose (e.g., a "Salesforce agent" can't also access HR data)

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Implement data governance framework
- Design purpose-specific tool access patterns
- Create data sensitivity classification system

### 4. User Experience (UX) & Ecosystem Issues

#### No Concept of Tool "Risk Level"

**Problem**: High-risk actions (e.g., delete_all_files) are presented for confirmation in the same way as low-risk actions (e.g., read_file), leading to "confirmation fatigue."

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Tiered Confirmations**: The client application (Claude, Cursor) should implement stronger confirmation flows for high-risk tools, such as requiring the user to type "CONFIRM DELETE"

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Implement tool risk classification system
- Design tiered confirmation UI patterns
- Create risk-aware user experience flows

#### Ecosystem Immaturity & Adoption

**Problem**: As a new standard, MCP lacks widespread support, comprehensive documentation, and a large number of ready-to-use servers for common applications.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Community & Vendor Development**: This is improving over time as companies like CData build servers for many sources and major players like Google and Microsoft join the MCP steering committee

**KGAS Architecture Implications**:
- Design for ecosystem evolution
- Plan for protocol changes and improvements
- Create comprehensive internal documentation
