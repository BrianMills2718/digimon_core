# Uncertainty Framework for Discourse Analysis - KGAS Context

## Core Understanding: Discourse Analysis Focus

**KGAS Purpose**: Understand discourse and its implications for social, behavioral, and cognitive factors. Enable description, explanation, prediction, and intervention development for discourse-related phenomena.

**NOT**: Fact-checking, truth determination, or authenticity detection
**YES**: Understanding patterns, influences, cognitive processes, and social dynamics in discourse

## Reframed Uncertainty Challenges for Discourse Analysis

### 1. **Theory Application Uncertainty**
**Core Question**: How confident are we that Social Identity Theory applies correctly to this specific discourse community?

```python
# Example: Applying Social Identity Theory to anti-vaccine discourse
theory_application = {
    "theory": "social_identity_theory",
    "discourse_context": "anti_vaccine_community_discord",
    "application_confidence": [0.6, 0.8],
    "uncertainty_factors": {
        "construct_validity": 0.7,        # Do online groups map to SIT constructs?
        "domain_appropriateness": 0.75,   # Does theory apply to health discourse?
        "operationalization": 0.65        # Are our measures valid for SIT concepts?
    },
    "reasoning": "Theory developed for face-to-face groups; online health discourse may have different dynamics"
}
```

### 2. **Discourse Pattern Recognition Uncertainty**  
**Core Question**: How confident are we in identifying specific discourse patterns and their social/cognitive implications?

```python
# Example: Identifying echo chamber effects
pattern_recognition = {
    "pattern": "echo_chamber_reinforcement",
    "confidence": [0.4, 0.7],
    "indicators": {
        "homophily_detection": 0.8,      # Similar users interact more
        "belief_polarization": 0.6,      # Beliefs become more extreme
        "dissent_suppression": 0.3       # Uncertain if disagreement is suppressed
    },
    "social_implications": {
        "group_cohesion_increase": 0.7,
        "outgroup_hostility_increase": 0.5,
        "belief_entrenchment": 0.8
    }
}
```

### 3. **Causal Mechanism Uncertainty**
**Core Question**: How confident are we about the causal mechanisms underlying observed discourse phenomena?

```python
# Example: Does exposure to conspiracy content cause belief change?
causal_analysis = {
    "mechanism": "conspiracy_exposure_belief_change",
    "causal_confidence": [0.3, 0.6],    # Low confidence in causation
    "evidence_types": {
        "correlation_observed": 0.9,     # High correlation
        "temporal_sequence": 0.5,        # Uncertain timing
        "alternative_explanations": 0.7  # Selection effects possible
    },
    "intervention_implications": {
        "content_moderation_effectiveness": [0.2, 0.5],
        "counter_messaging_potential": [0.3, 0.7]
    }
}
```

### 4. **Cross-Community Generalization Uncertainty**
**Core Question**: How confident are we that patterns found in one discourse community apply to others?

```python
# Example: QAnon patterns generalizing to other conspiracy communities
generalization_analysis = {
    "source_community": "qanon_discourse",
    "target_community": "anti_vaccine_discourse", 
    "generalization_confidence": [0.4, 0.7],
    "shared_features": {
        "mistrust_authorities": 0.9,
        "in_group_solidarity": 0.8,
        "coded_language_use": 0.6
    },
    "unique_features": {
        "qanon_specific": ["q_drops", "storm_references"],
        "antivax_specific": ["medical_terminology", "safety_concerns"]
    }
}
```

## KGAS-Specific Uncertainty Applications

### 1. **Theory Meta-Schema Application Confidence**
```python
@dataclass
class TheoryApplicationUncertainty:
    theory_id: str                          # "social_identity_theory"
    discourse_domain: str                   # "health_conspiracy_discourse"
    construct_validity: float               # How well do theory constructs apply?
    measurement_validity: float             # Do our measures capture constructs?
    boundary_conditions: Dict[str, float]   # When does theory not apply?
    
    def calculate_application_confidence(self) -> ConfidenceScore:
        # Combine validity concerns using CERQual framework
        pass
```

### 2. **Master Concept Library Mapping Confidence**
```python
# Mapping indigenous discourse terms to MCL concepts
concept_mapping = {
    "indigenous_term": "pureblood",          # Term used in anti-vax discourse
    "mcl_mapping": "InGroupIdentifier",      # Mapped to MCL concept
    "mapping_confidence": [0.6, 0.8],
    "semantic_precision": 0.7,               # How well does mapping preserve meaning?
    "context_sensitivity": 0.5,             # Does meaning vary by context?
    "theoretical_implications": {
        "social_identity": 0.8,              # Strong relevance to SIT
        "moral_foundations": 0.6             # Moderate relevance to MFT
    }
}
```

### 3. **Discourse Influence Mechanism Uncertainty**
```python
# Understanding how discourse influences behavior/cognition
influence_mechanism = {
    "mechanism": "social_proof_conspiracy_adoption",
    "confidence": [0.4, 0.7],
    "pathway": {
        "exposure_to_community": 0.9,        # High confidence in exposure
        "social_validation_seeking": 0.7,    # Moderate confidence in motivation
        "belief_adoption": 0.5,              # Lower confidence in actual adoption
        "behavioral_change": 0.3             # Low confidence in behavior change
    },
    "moderating_factors": {
        "prior_beliefs": 0.8,                # Strong moderator
        "social_network_density": 0.6,       # Moderate moderator
        "cognitive_sophistication": 0.4      # Uncertain moderator
    }
}
```

## Practical Implementation for Discourse Analysis

### 1. **Theory-Guided Uncertainty Assessment**
```python
class TheoryGuidedUncertaintyAssessment:
    def assess_discourse_pattern(self, discourse_data: DiscourseData, 
                               theory_schema: TheoryMetaSchema) -> UncertaintyAssessment:
        
        # Assess how well theory constructs map to observed discourse
        construct_mapping = self.assess_construct_validity(discourse_data, theory_schema)
        
        # Assess confidence in causal mechanisms proposed by theory
        causal_confidence = self.assess_causal_mechanisms(discourse_data, theory_schema)
        
        # Assess boundary conditions and scope limitations
        boundary_assessment = self.assess_boundary_conditions(discourse_data, theory_schema)
        
        return UncertaintyAssessment(
            theory_application_confidence=construct_mapping,
            causal_mechanism_confidence=causal_confidence,
            generalization_confidence=boundary_assessment
        )
```

### 2. **Discourse-Specific Confidence Calibration**
```python
class DiscourseSpecificCalibration:
    def calibrate_for_discourse_domain(self, domain: str) -> CalibrationFactors:
        """Adjust confidence based on discourse domain characteristics"""
        
        calibration_factors = {
            "conspiracy_discourse": {
                "language_ambiguity_factor": 0.8,    # High coded language use
                "irony_sarcasm_factor": 0.9,         # Moderate irony
                "tribal_signaling_factor": 0.7       # High in-group signaling
            },
            "political_discourse": {
                "language_ambiguity_factor": 0.9,    # Moderate coded language
                "irony_sarcasm_factor": 0.6,         # High irony/sarcasm
                "tribal_signaling_factor": 0.8       # High partisan signaling
            },
            "health_discourse": {
                "language_ambiguity_factor": 0.9,    # Low coded language
                "irony_sarcasm_factor": 0.8,         # Low irony
                "tribal_signaling_factor": 0.7       # Moderate community signaling
            }
        }
        
        return calibration_factors.get(domain, default_factors)
```

### 3. **Intervention Confidence Assessment**
```python
class InterventionConfidenceAssessment:
    def assess_intervention_potential(self, discourse_analysis: DiscourseAnalysis) -> InterventionConfidence:
        """Assess confidence in potential interventions based on discourse understanding"""
        
        return InterventionConfidence(
            counter_messaging_potential={
                "effectiveness_confidence": [0.3, 0.6],
                "mechanism": "cognitive_dissonance_induction",
                "barriers": ["confirmation_bias", "motivated_reasoning"],
                "facilitators": ["trusted_messengers", "personal_relevance"]
            },
            community_norm_change={
                "effectiveness_confidence": [0.4, 0.7], 
                "mechanism": "social_proof_cascade",
                "barriers": ["echo_chamber_effects", "identity_protection"],
                "facilitators": ["influential_members", "gradual_shift"]
            },
            platform_design_changes={
                "effectiveness_confidence": [0.2, 0.5],
                "mechanism": "choice_architecture",
                "barriers": ["user_adaptation", "platform_incentives"],
                "facilitators": ["friction_introduction", "default_changes"]
            }
        )
```

## Key Differences from Previous Framework

### What Changed:
1. **Focus shifted** from truth/authenticity to **discourse pattern understanding**
2. **Theory application confidence** became central uncertainty type
3. **Causal mechanism uncertainty** critical for intervention development
4. **Cross-community generalization** important for scaling insights
5. **Intervention effectiveness** confidence guides practical applications

### What Stayed:
1. **CERQual framework** still applicable for assessing evidence quality
2. **Fuzzy categorization** still valuable for discourse patterns
3. **Temporal uncertainty** still relevant for discourse evolution
4. **Correlation-aware aggregation** still needed for community analysis
5. **Adaptive computation** still valuable for resource allocation

## Updated Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Theory Application Uncertainty
1. **Implement theory-guided confidence assessment** using Theory Meta-Schema
2. **Create discourse domain calibration** for different community types
3. **Add construct validity uncertainty** for MCL concept mapping

### Phase 2: Causal Mechanism Assessment  
4. **Implement causal pathway confidence** assessment
5. **Add moderating factor uncertainty** tracking
6. **Create intervention potential assessment** framework

### Phase 3: Cross-Community Generalization
7. **Implement generalization confidence** assessment
8. **Add boundary condition detection** for theory applicability
9. **Create comparative discourse analysis** with uncertainty propagation

This reframing makes the uncertainty framework specifically valuable for discourse analysis researchers seeking to understand social/behavioral/cognitive phenomena rather than determine objective truth.
