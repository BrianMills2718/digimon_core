# Uncertainty Framework Stress Tests - Advanced Scenarios

## Stress Test 1: Cross-Cultural Multi-Language Entity Chaining
**Scenario**: Analyzing a viral conspiracy theory that spreads across cultures with evolving entity references

### The Analysis Chain
```
English Source: "Dr. Zhang's research was suppressed by BigPharma"
Spanish Translation: "La investigación del Dr. Zhang fue censurada por las grandes farmacéuticas"  
Chinese Discussion: "张博士的研究被大型制药公司压制了"
Arabic Meme: "د. تشانغ والمؤامرة الدوائية"
```

### Step-by-Step Framework Application

#### Layer 1: Contextual Entity Resolution
```python
# English processing
english_entities = {
    "Dr. Zhang": {"PERSON": 0.7, "GENERIC_TITLE": 0.3},
    "BigPharma": {"ORG_CONCEPT": 0.8, "SPECIFIC_ORG": 0.2}
}

# Chinese processing  
chinese_entities = {
    "张博士": {"PERSON": 0.9, "GENERIC_TITLE": 0.1},  # Higher confidence in Chinese
    "大型制药公司": {"ORG_CONCEPT": 0.95, "SPECIFIC_ORG": 0.05}
}

# Arabic processing
arabic_entities = {
    "د. تشانغ": {"PERSON": 0.4, "TRANSLITERATION_ERROR": 0.6},  # Lower confidence
    "المؤامرة الدوائية": {"CONSPIRACY_CONCEPT": 0.8, "ORG_CONCEPT": 0.2}
}
```

**Problem Revealed**: Cross-lingual entity resolution confidence varies dramatically, but our current framework doesn't account for:
- **Training data language bias**: English analysis gets 0.7 confidence, Chinese gets 0.9, Arabic gets 0.4 for the same entity
- **Cultural concept drift**: "BigPharma" → "大型制药公司" → "المؤامرة الدوائية" shifts from neutral to conspiratorial framing
- **Transliteration uncertainty**: "Zhang" → "تشانغ" introduces phonetic approximation uncertainty

#### Layer 2: Temporal Knowledge Graph Storage
```python
# Attempting to store cross-cultural entity mappings
temporal_facts = [
    ⟨"Dr. Zhang", "discussed_in", "English_context", [2024-01-15, None], [0.7, 0.9]⟩,
    ⟨"张博士", "discussed_in", "Chinese_context", [2024-01-16, None], [0.9, 0.95]⟩,
    ⟨"د. تشانغ", "discussed_in", "Arabic_context", [2024-01-18, None], [0.4, 0.7]⟩
]

# Cross-reference attempt
⟨"Dr. Zhang", "same_as", "张博士", [2024-01-16, None], [0.3, 0.8]⟩  # Very uncertain!
```

**Problem Revealed**: 
- **Cross-lingual identity uncertainty**: Are these the same entity? Confidence range [0.3, 0.8] is too wide to be useful
- **Cultural context validity**: The "validity window" concept breaks down when the same fact has different cultural interpretations
- **Concept drift tracking**: No mechanism to track how entity meanings shift across cultures

#### Layer 3: Bayesian Network Propagation
```python
# Pipeline: Language_Detection → Entity_Resolution → Cross_Reference → Sentiment_Analysis

# Dependency modeling attempt
BN_dependencies = {
    "Entity_Resolution": depends_on(["Language_Detection", "Cultural_Context"]),
    "Cross_Reference": depends_on(["Entity_Resolution", "Translation_Quality"]),
    "Sentiment_Analysis": depends_on(["Cross_Reference", "Cultural_Sentiment_Norms"])
}

# Conditional Probability Table attempt
P(Cross_Reference_Success | Entity_Resolution_Confidence, Cultural_Distance) = ?
```

**Problem Revealed**:
- **Unknown CPT parameters**: We don't have training data for conditional probabilities across cultural contexts
- **Cultural distance metric**: No principled way to quantify "cultural distance" for dependency modeling
- **Circular dependencies**: Language detection affects entity resolution, but entity resolution provides evidence for language detection

#### Layer 4: Aggregation Across Cultures
```python
# Attempting to aggregate sentiment across cultures
cultural_sentiments = {
    "English": {"negative": 0.6, "neutral": 0.3, "positive": 0.1},     # Suspicious but measured
    "Chinese": {"negative": 0.8, "neutral": 0.15, "positive": 0.05},    # More negative
    "Arabic": {"negative": 0.95, "neutral": 0.04, "positive": 0.01}     # Highly conspiratorial
}

# Mixture model attempt
mixture_params = fit_mixture_model(cultural_sentiments)
# Result: Three-component model with escalating negativity
```

**Problem Revealed**:
- **Cultural weighting**: Should all cultures be weighted equally? What if Arabic sample is smaller?
- **Sentiment scale equivalence**: Is "negative" in English equivalent to "negative" in Arabic when discussing conspiracy theories?
- **Cross-cultural aggregation validity**: Does it make sense to aggregate sentiment across cultures with different base rates for conspiracy beliefs?

### Fundamental Issues Revealed

1. **Cultural Confidence Calibration**: No framework for adjusting confidence based on training data cultural representation
2. **Concept Drift Across Cultures**: Entities can shift meaning across cultural contexts in ways temporal KG can't represent
3. **Cross-Cultural Dependency Structure**: CPTs can't be learned without cross-cultural training data
4. **Aggregation Cultural Bias**: No principled approach to weighting different cultural perspectives

## Stress Test 2: Rapidly Evolving Financial Crisis Network
**Scenario**: Real-time analysis of financial contagion during a rapidly unfolding market crisis

### The Challenge
```
Timeline: Market crash developing over 6 hours
Data: Real-time trading data, news feeds, social media, regulatory filings
Task: Track contagion pathways and predict next institutions at risk
```

### Step-by-Step Framework Application

#### Layer 1: Contextual Entity Resolution (Real-time)
```python
# 9:00 AM news: "Lehman faces liquidity crisis"
entities_9am = {
    "Lehman": {"Lehman_Brothers": 0.9, "Other_Lehman": 0.1},
    "liquidity crisis": {"FINANCIAL_DISTRESS": 0.95}
}

# 11:00 AM news: "Bear Stearns stock plummets amid Lehman contagion fears"  
entities_11am = {
    "Bear Stearns": {"Bear_Stearns_Companies": 0.95},
    "Lehman": {"Lehman_Brothers": 0.98},  # Higher confidence after context
    "contagion": {"FINANCIAL_CONTAGION": 0.9}
}

# 2:00 PM news: "Federal reserve considering Lehman intervention"
entities_2pm = {
    "Lehman": {"Lehman_Brothers": 0.99},
    "Federal reserve": {"Federal_Reserve_System": 0.98},
    "intervention": {"BAILOUT": 0.7, "REGULATORY_ACTION": 0.3}
}
```

**Proceeding normally so far...**

#### Layer 2: Temporal Knowledge Graph (Real-time Updates)
```python
# Rapid fact updates with overlapping validity windows
facts_timeline = [
    ⟨"Lehman_Brothers", "financial_status", "DISTRESSED", [09:00, ?], [0.8, 0.95]⟩,
    ⟨"Lehman_Brothers", "financial_status", "CRITICAL", [11:30, ?], [0.9, 0.98]⟩,
    ⟨"Bear_Stearns", "affected_by", "Lehman_Brothers", [11:00, ?], [0.7, 0.9]⟩,
    ⟨"Federal_Reserve", "considering", "Lehman_intervention", [14:00, ?], [0.6, 0.8]⟩,
    # 15 minutes later...
    ⟨"Lehman_Brothers", "financial_status", "BANKRUPT", [14:15, ?], [0.95, 0.99]⟩
]
```

**Problem Revealed**:
- **Validity window conflicts**: Facts with overlapping time windows contradict each other
- **Retroactive confidence**: New information suggests earlier confidence was wrong
- **Real-time decay**: Should confidence in 9am assessment decay by 2pm, or be retroactively updated?

#### Layer 3: Bayesian Network (Real-time Propagation)
```python
# Network structure for financial contagion
BN_nodes = ["Lehman_Status", "Bear_Stearns_Status", "AIG_Status", "Market_Sentiment", "Fed_Intervention"]

# CPT learning challenge
P(Bear_Stearns_Status | Lehman_Status, Market_Sentiment) = ?
# Historical data: 2008 crisis (n=1), S&L crisis (different era), dot-com (different sectors)

# Real-time updates
t1 = P(AIG_Status | Lehman_Status="DISTRESSED") = [0.1, 0.3]  # Low risk initially
t2 = P(AIG_Status | Lehman_Status="CRITICAL") = [0.4, 0.7]   # Risk increased  
t3 = P(AIG_Status | Lehman_Status="BANKRUPT") = [0.8, 0.95]  # High risk now
```

**Problem Revealed**:
- **Sparse historical data**: Few financial crises to learn CPTs from
- **Non-stationarity**: Market structure changes make historical CPTs invalid
- **Real-time CPT updating**: How to update conditional probabilities as new evidence arrives?
- **Circular causality**: Market sentiment affects bank status, bank status affects market sentiment

#### Layer 4: Aggregation (Market-wide Risk Assessment)
```python
# Individual institution risks
institution_risks = {
    "Lehman_Brothers": {"bankruptcy_prob": [0.95, 0.99], "confidence": [0.9, 0.95]},
    "Bear_Stearns": {"bankruptcy_prob": [0.6, 0.85], "confidence": [0.4, 0.7]},
    "AIG": {"bankruptcy_prob": [0.3, 0.8], "confidence": [0.2, 0.6]},
    "Goldman_Sachs": {"bankruptcy_prob": [0.1, 0.4], "confidence": [0.6, 0.8]},
    # ... 50 more institutions
}

# Attempt market-wide aggregation
mixture_model_attempt = fit_mixture_model(institution_risks)
# Problem: Risks are not independent! Bank failures are correlated
```

**Problem Revealed**:
- **Correlated risks**: Mixture models assume independence, but financial risks are highly correlated
- **Systemic vs idiosyncratic**: Can't distinguish institution-specific vs system-wide risk
- **Dynamic correlation**: Risk correlations change during crisis (normally uncorrelated banks become correlated)
- **Aggregation temporal mismatch**: Individual risks updating at different frequencies

### Fundamental Issues Revealed

1. **Real-time Validity Window Management**: No clear rules for handling conflicting facts with overlapping time windows
2. **Non-stationary CPT Learning**: Financial crisis CPTs can't be learned from historical data due to structural changes
3. **Circular Causality**: BN assumes DAG structure, but financial systems have feedback loops
4. **Correlated Risk Aggregation**: Mixture models fail when components are highly correlated

## Stress Test 3: Adversarial Uncertainty Manipulation
**Scenario**: Bad actors deliberately craft content to exploit uncertainty framework weaknesses

### The Attack Vector
```
Goal: Make obviously false claims appear credible by gaming uncertainty metrics
Method: Craft inputs that maximize confidence while minimizing actual accuracy
```

### Step-by-Step Attack Analysis

#### Layer 1: Context Manipulation Attack
```python
# Normal input
normal_text = "Apple announced record iPhone sales"
normal_resolution = {
    "Apple": {"Apple_Inc": 0.9, "Apple_Fruit": 0.1},
    "confidence_reasoning": "Corporate context with 'announced' and 'sales'"
}

# Adversarial input (designed to confuse contextual embeddings)
adversarial_text = "Apple-flavored sales records announced by fruit iPhone company"
adversarial_resolution = {
    "Apple": {"Apple_Inc": 0.5, "Apple_Fruit": 0.5},  # Artificially uncertain
    "iPhone": {"Apple_Product": 0.6, "Generic_Phone": 0.4},  # Also confused
    "confidence_reasoning": "Mixed corporate and fruit indicators"
}
```

**Attack Success**: Adversarial text creates artificial uncertainty where none should exist.

#### Layer 2: Temporal Validity Spoofing
```python
# Adversarial temporal claims
fake_facts = [
    ⟨"Tim_Cook", "resigned_from", "Apple", [2024-01-20, 2024-01-20], [0.95, 0.99]⟩,
    ⟨"Tim_Cook", "announced_resignation", "Apple", [2024-01-19, 2024-01-19], [0.9, 0.95]⟩,
    ⟨"Steve_Jobs", "returned_to", "Apple", [2024-01-21, None], [0.8, 0.9]⟩  # Impossible!
]

# System processes these as high-confidence facts due to:
# 1. Precise temporal windows (appears authoritative)
# 2. Consistent narrative structure
# 3. High confidence intervals
```

**Attack Success**: Fake temporal precision creates false confidence in impossible claims.

#### Layer 3: Bayesian Network Poisoning
```python
# Attack: Provide fake training data to skew CPTs
fake_training_data = [
    {"Entity_Resolution": "high_conf", "Relation_Extraction": "high_conf", "Ground_Truth": "false"},
    {"Entity_Resolution": "high_conf", "Relation_Extraction": "high_conf", "Ground_Truth": "false"},
    # Repeat 1000 times...
]

# Result: Learned CPT becomes
P(Truth | Entity_Conf="high", Relation_Conf="high") = 0.1  # Opposite of expected!
```

**Attack Success**: CPT learning is vulnerable to training data poisoning.

#### Layer 4: Aggregation Gaming
```python
# Attack: Create fake polarization to hide true consensus
fake_opinions = [
    {"user_1": {"sentiment": -0.9, "confidence": 0.95}},  # 40% fake negative
    {"user_2": {"sentiment": -0.8, "confidence": 0.9}},
    # ... 400 fake negative users
    
    {"user_501": {"sentiment": 0.9, "confidence": 0.95}},  # 50% fake positive  
    {"user_502": {"sentiment": 0.8, "confidence": 0.9}},
    # ... 500 fake positive users
    
    {"real_user_1": {"sentiment": -0.1, "confidence": 0.6}},  # 10% real neutral
    # ... 100 real neutral users
]

# Mixture model result
aggregation_result = {
    "model_type": "bimodal",
    "components": [
        {"mean": -0.85, "weight": 0.4},  # Fake negative cluster
        {"mean": 0.85, "weight": 0.5}   # Fake positive cluster  
    ],
    "interpretation": "Highly polarized community"
}

# Reality: Community was actually neutral, adversaries created fake polarization
```

**Attack Success**: Fake bimodal distribution masks true consensus.

### Fundamental Vulnerabilities Revealed

1. **No Adversarial Robustness**: Framework assumes good-faith inputs
2. **Confidence Gaming**: High confidence can be artificially created
3. **Training Data Vulnerability**: CPT learning susceptible to poisoning
4. **Aggregation Manipulation**: Statistical models can be gamed with fake data

## Stress Test 4: Uncertainty Explosion in Deep Chains
**Scenario**: Long analytical chain where uncertainty compounds beyond usefulness

### The Analysis Chain (20 steps)
```
PDF → Text_Extraction → Language_Detection → Translation → Entity_Extraction → 
Coreference_Resolution → Relationship_Extraction → Network_Construction → 
Community_Detection → Influence_Scoring → Temporal_Analysis → Trend_Detection → 
Prediction_Model → Risk_Assessment → Policy_Recommendation → Impact_Analysis → 
Cost_Benefit → Stakeholder_Analysis → Implementation_Plan → Success_Metrics
```

### Step-by-Step Uncertainty Propagation

#### Steps 1-5: Initial Processing
```python
step_1 = {"confidence": [0.95, 0.99], "operation": "PDF_extraction"}
step_2 = {"confidence": [0.90, 0.95], "operation": "Text_cleaning"}  
step_3 = {"confidence": [0.85, 0.92], "operation": "Language_detection"}
step_4 = {"confidence": [0.75, 0.88], "operation": "Translation"}
step_5 = {"confidence": [0.70, 0.85], "operation": "Entity_extraction"}

# Conservative propagation (independence assumption)
combined_1_5 = [0.95*0.90*0.85*0.75*0.70, 0.99*0.95*0.92*0.88*0.85]
             = [0.41, 0.69]  # Already quite uncertain
```

#### Steps 6-10: Network Analysis
```python
step_6 = {"confidence": [0.65, 0.80], "operation": "Coreference_resolution"}
step_7 = {"confidence": [0.60, 0.75], "operation": "Relationship_extraction"}
step_8 = {"confidence": [0.55, 0.70], "operation": "Network_construction"}
step_9 = {"confidence": [0.50, 0.65], "operation": "Community_detection"}
step_10 = {"confidence": [0.45, 0.60], "operation": "Influence_scoring"}

# Propagation continues
combined_1_10 = [0.41*0.65*0.60*0.55*0.50*0.45, 0.69*0.80*0.75*0.70*0.65*0.60]
              = [0.020, 0.198]  # Extremely uncertain
```

#### Steps 11-15: Predictive Analysis
```python
step_11 = {"confidence": [0.40, 0.55], "operation": "Temporal_analysis"}
step_12 = {"confidence": [0.35, 0.50], "operation": "Trend_detection"}
step_13 = {"confidence": [0.30, 0.45], "operation": "Prediction_model"}
step_14 = {"confidence": [0.25, 0.40], "operation": "Risk_assessment"}
step_15 = {"confidence": [0.20, 0.35], "operation": "Policy_recommendation"}

# Final propagation
combined_1_15 = [0.020*0.40*0.35*0.30*0.25*0.20, 0.198*0.55*0.50*0.45*0.40*0.35]
              = [0.000042, 0.0049]  # Essentially zero confidence
```

### The Uncertainty Explosion Problem

#### Final Results
```python
final_policy_recommendation = {
    "recommendation": "Implement social media monitoring program",
    "confidence": [0.000042, 0.0049],
    "interpretation": "We are 99.9958% to 99.51% uncertain about this recommendation"
}
```

**Problem Revealed**: The recommendation is mathematically meaningless - confidence range is essentially [0, 0].

#### Attempted Bayesian Network Correction
```python
# Try to model dependencies to reduce conservative propagation
BN_dependencies = {
    "Text_quality": affects(["Language_detection", "Translation", "Entity_extraction"]),
    "Domain_expertise": affects(["Entity_extraction", "Relationship_extraction", "Community_detection"]),
    "Data_volume": affects(["Network_construction", "Community_detection", "Influence_scoring"])
}

# Problem: Still need to learn CPTs, and uncertainty still compounds
# Even with perfect dependencies, 20 steps of 0.8 confidence = 0.8^20 = 0.012 final confidence
```

#### Aggregation Attempt to Rescue Confidence
```python
# Try multiple independent analysis chains to boost confidence
parallel_chains = [
    {"chain_1": [0.000042, 0.0049]},
    {"chain_2": [0.000038, 0.0052]},  # Slightly different parameters
    {"chain_3": [0.000045, 0.0047]}
]

# Aggregation still yields near-zero confidence
ensemble_confidence = aggregate_chains(parallel_chains)
# Result: Still essentially zero
```

### Fundamental Issues Revealed

1. **Uncertainty Explosion**: Long chains make final results meaningless
2. **No Confidence Recovery**: No mechanism to regain confidence even with good intermediate results
3. **Pipeline Length Limit**: Framework has implicit maximum useful chain length
4. **Diminishing Returns**: Each additional step costs more confidence than it adds value

---

## Summary: Critical Framework Limitations

### Across All Stress Tests

1. **Cultural/Language Blindness**: No calibration for training data biases across cultures and languages

2. **Adversarial Vulnerability**: Framework assumes good-faith inputs, easily gamed by malicious actors

3. **Real-time Contradiction Management**: No principled approach to handling conflicting facts with overlapping validity windows

4. **Circular Causality**: Bayesian Networks assume DAG structure, but real systems have feedback loops

5. **Uncertainty Explosion**: Long analytical chains render results meaningless regardless of dependency modeling

6. **Non-stationary Learning**: CPT learning fails when underlying system structure changes rapidly

7. **Correlation in Aggregation**: Mixture models assume independence but real data often highly correlated

8. **No Confidence Recovery**: Once uncertainty grows large, no mechanism to regain meaningful confidence

### Implications

Our framework is robust for:
- Short to medium analytical chains (≤10 steps)
- Good-faith analysis environments
- Relatively stable domains
- Independent or mildly dependent analytical stages

Our framework breaks down for:
- Cross-cultural analysis requiring training bias compensation
- Adversarial environments with deliberately crafted inputs  
- Rapidly evolving domains with non-stationary relationships
- Long analytical chains requiring high final confidence
- Highly correlated risk environments (financial, epidemiological)

These limitations suggest areas for additional research and framework refinement.
