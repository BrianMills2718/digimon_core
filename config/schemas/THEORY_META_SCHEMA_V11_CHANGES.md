## üîç Detailed Changes

### **1. Added Required `theoretical_scope` Section**

**Rationale**: Our SIT analysis revealed we had no systematic way to document what contexts a theory applies to, leading to inappropriate applications (diplomatic cooperation analysis with competitive intergroup theory).

**New Required Fields**:
```json
{
  "theoretical_scope": {
    "authors_stated_domain": ["contexts authors say theory explains"],
    "exclusion_contexts": ["contexts where theory shouldn't be applied"], 
    "authors_stated_limitations": ["limitations authors acknowledge"],
    "boundary_conditions": ["when theory predictions may not hold"],
    "scope_citations": [{"claim": "...", "page_reference": "..."}]
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Forces explicit scope documentation during theory-schema creation
- Prevents Carter-style misapplications (diplomatic cooperation ‚â† competitive intergroup dynamics)
- Creates paper-traceable scope claims

**Example Impact**: SIT theory-schema would be required to document "applies to competitive intergroup contexts" and "does not apply to diplomatic cooperation contexts."

---

### **2. Added `empirical_foundation` Section**

**Rationale**: We fabricated correlations (r=0.73) that don't exist in original SIT paper, creating pseudoscientific precision.

**New Structure**:
```json
{
  "empirical_foundation": {
    "authors_empirical_claims": [{
      "claim": "What authors actually claimed",
      "evidence_type": "experimental|correlational|observational|theoretical|meta_analytic",
      "specific_statistic": "Exact statistic if provided", 
      "source_in_paper": "Page/section reference",
      "study_context": "Context of supporting study"
    }],
    "source_verification_required": true
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents fabricated statistical relationships
- Requires paper-traceable empirical claims
- Maintains precision without false precision
- Enables proper operationalization using actual evidence

**Example Impact**: Would have prevented our r=0.73 fabrication by requiring source verification.

---

### **3. Added `theory_comparisons` Section**

**Rationale**: We confused different theories (SIT + Contact Hypothesis + Realistic Conflict Theory), creating chimera theories that don't exist.

**New Structure**:
```json
{
  "theory_comparisons": {
    "authors_explicit_comparisons": [{
      "other_theory": "Theory name",
      "authors_comparison": "How authors compare",
      "claimed_advantage": "Why authors prefer their theory",
      "page_reference": "Source location"
    }],
    "cited_predecessors": ["Theories authors build on"]
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Documents only comparisons authors actually make
- Prevents theory mixing/contamination
- Maintains theoretical purity
- Provides foundation for future theory competition

**Example Impact**: Would have prevented mixing SIT with Contact Hypothesis by documenting they're separate theories.

---

### **4. Enhanced Execution: Mandatory Applicability Check**

**Rationale**: We applied theories without checking if they fit the context, leading to forced analyses.

**New Required Structure**:
```json
{
  "execution": {
    "mandatory_applicability_check": {
      "step_id": "theory_applicability_assessment",
      "method": "llm_extraction", 
      "description": "Assess whether theory applies to this context before proceeding",
      "required_outputs": ["applicability_score", "boundary_assessment"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Additional Features**:
- `applicability_threshold` field for analysis steps
- Steps can be conditionally executed based on applicability scores

**Benefits**:
- Forces scope checking before analysis
- Prevents inappropriate theory application
- Enables graceful failure when theory doesn't fit
- Creates systematic applicability documentation

**Example Impact**: Would have caught that Carter's diplomatic speech doesn't match SIT's competitive domain before attempting analysis.

---

### **5. Enhanced Validation: Negative Finding Interpretation**

**Rationale**: When theories don't fit, we forced analyses rather than recognizing this as theoretically meaningful.

**New Structure**:
```json
{
  "validation": {
    "negative_finding_interpretation": {
      "when_patterns_absent": "How to interpret missing predicted patterns",
      "scope_refinement_implications": "What negative findings reveal about boundaries",
      "alternative_explanations": ["Other theories to consider when this doesn't fit"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Turns "theory doesn't work" into theoretical insight
- Provides guidance for handling negative findings
- Suggests alternative frameworks
- Prevents forced positive interpretations

**Example Impact**: Would have guided us to interpret Carter's cooperation-building as outside SIT scope rather than forcing SIT patterns.

---

### **6. Added `post_hoc_enhancements` Section**

**Rationale**: Need to distinguish what comes from original paper vs. what researchers add later.

**New Structure**:
```json
{
  "post_hoc_enhancements": {
    "alternative_theories_identified": [{"theory_name": "...", "added_by": "..."}],
    "external_validation_studies": [{"study_citation": "...", "finding": "..."}],
    "scope_refinements": [{"refinement": "...", "evidence": "..."}]
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of original vs. added content
- Tracks provenance of enhancements
- Enables schema evolution while maintaining source integrity
- Supports collaborative theory development

**Example Impact**: Alternative theories for Carter case (Contact Hypothesis, Diplomatic Communication Theory) would be properly documented as post-hoc additions.

---

### **7. Enhanced Metadata: Source Verification**

**Rationale**: Need to track whether empirical claims have been verified against original papers.

**New Field**:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "source_paper_verified": "boolean - whether empirical claims verified against original"
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Quality control for theory-schema creation
- Prevents circulation of unverified claims
- Supports systematic verification processes
- Maintains scientific integrity
