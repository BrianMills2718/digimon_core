Full System Demo - Complete GraphRAG Capabilities

This comprehensive demo showcases all implemented features of the Super-Digimon GraphRAG system:
- Phase 1: Basic PDF workflow with entity extraction and PageRank
- Phase 2: Enhanced workflow with ontology awareness  
- Phase 3: Multi-document processing and fusion
- Service integration and configuration management
- UI components and error handling

Usage:
    python demo/full_system_demo.py

Requirements:
    - Python 3.8+
    - All dependencies installed (pip install -e .)
    - Neo4j running (optional - system gracefully degrades)
