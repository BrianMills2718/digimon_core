print("""
1. Pattern-Based: Uses linguistic patterns like "X is CEO of Y" or "X founded Y"
   - Most reliable method (confidence 0.7-0.9)
   - Captures specific relationship types

2. Dependency Parsing: Analyzes grammatical structure (subject-verb-object)
   - Good for simple sentences (confidence 0.6-0.8)
   - Requires clear sentence structure

3. Proximity-Based: Finds entities near each other
   - Fallback method (confidence ~0.5)
   - Creates generic RELATED_TO relationships

Entity confidence factors:
- Base spaCy confidence: 0.85
- Type adjustments: MONEY/DATE (0.95), WORK_OF_ART (0.75)
- Length bonus: Longer entities get higher confidence
- Context quality: From source document

Relationship confidence factors:
- Pattern confidence: 40% weight
- Context confidence: 30% weight  
- Entity confidence: 30% weight
- Distance penalty for proximity-based
