## Response:

VERDICT: âœ… FULLY RESOLVED

The provided code implements a robust performance tracking system fulfilling all the specified requirements.  Here's a breakdown with evidence:

1. **PerformanceTracker class is fully implemented (not a stub/placeholder):** The `PerformanceTracker` class (lines 128-509) is a complete implementation, not a stub. It includes methods for starting and ending operations, calculating baselines, detecting degradation, and persistent storage.

2. **Automatic baseline calculation after configurable samples (default 100):** The `_update_baseline_if_needed` method (lines 406-446) calculates and updates baselines after accumulating `self.baseline_samples` (default 100) successful operation samples.  The code explicitly checks this condition (`if len(successful_metrics) < self.baseline_samples: return`).

3. **Degradation detection when performance exceeds thresholds:** The `PerformanceBaseline.is_degraded` method (lines 122-126) defines degradation as exceeding the 95th percentile or being more than two standard deviations above the mean.  This is used within `end_operation` (lines 371-378) to detect and log degradation events.

4. **Persistent storage of baselines to JSON file:** The `_save_baselines` (lines 280-297) and `_load_baselines` (lines 258-273) methods handle the asynchronous loading and saving of baselines to a JSON file specified by `storage_path` (defaulting to "performance_data.json").  The use of `aiofiles` indicates asynchronous file I/O.

5. **Time operation decorator for easy integration:** The `time_operation` decorator (lines 451-499) provides a convenient way to instrument functions, automatically timing their execution using the tracker's start and end operation methods. It gracefully handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

6. **Rolling window metrics with configurable size (default 1000):**  The `_metrics` attribute (line 172) uses `defaultdict(lambda: deque(maxlen=window_size))` to implement a rolling window of size `window_size` (default 1000) for each operation's metrics. This ensures that only the most recent metrics are stored.


The code is comprehensive, well-structured, and demonstrates a clear understanding of performance tracking principles. The use of asynchronous operations and error handling further enhances its robustness.
