Preface
This monograph surveys and integrates scholarly social-science litera-
ture relating to stabilization and reconstruction (S&R). Its intent is to
inform analysis and decisionmaking within the Department of Defense
and other government agencies concerned with international interven-
tions in the wake of conflict. It is a follow-on to a prior RAND study
reviewing and integrating work on terrorism and counterterrorism:
Paul K. Davis and Kim Cragin, eds., Social Science for Counter
terrorism: Putting the Pieces Together, Santa Monica, Calif.:
RAND Corporation, 2009.
The project was sponsored by the Modeling and Simulation Coor-
dination Office of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), with
oversight provided by James Bexfield, the Director of Planning and
Analytical Support in OSD’s Cost and Program Evaluation (CAPE)
and the Irregular Warfare Modeling and Simulation Senior Advisory
Group. Comments and questions are welcome and should be addressed
to the editor and project leader, Paul K. Davis (Santa Monica, Califor-
nia; pdavis@rand.org).
This research was conducted within the International Security
and Defense Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research
Institute, a federally funded research and development center spon-
sored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Uni-
fied Combatant Commands, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the defense
agencies, and the defense Intelligence Community.

Summary

Introduction
Objectives and Scope
Governments intervening in post-conflict states find themselves beset
with numerous challenges and profound dilemmas: It is often unclear
how best to proceed because measures that may improve conditions
in one respect may undermine them in another. Our study was an
integrative review of the scholarly social-science literature relevant to
stabilization and reconstruction (S&R). We sought to inform strategic
planning at the whole-of-government level. Thus, we deal not only
with stability operations—i.e., operations to maintain or reestablish a
safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services,
construct emergency infrastructure, and offer humanitarian relief—
but also possible activities related to transition, reconstruction, and
nation-building.
Our research drew from such subject areas as civil wars, conflict
resolution, conflict prevention, developmental economics, political
development and political economy, stability operations, peacekeep-
ing, and intervention. This base reflected such disciplines as econom-
ics, political science, policy analysis, sociology, psychology, history,
and anthropology. We also drew on practitioner-informed works by
the U.S. Institute of Peace, the State Department’s Office of the Coor-
dinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), foundations,
RAND, and other civilian and military organizations.
xvi Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Approach
We took a “system view,” attempting to view the entire system rather
than just one or another separate component. Figure S.1 is a top-level
depiction of the problem space.* It asserts that S&R success depends
on success in each of four component domains dealing, respectively,
with security, political, social, and economic issues. We treat these as
individually critical: Achieving some threshold level of success in each
component is necessary for overall success. Although this concept is
often mentioned informally, we build it into analysis. Just as a military
commander knows that he must attend to logistics as well as to maneu-
ver, so also intervenors must attend to all of the critical components
indicated. Further, to understand a situation or draw conclusions from
data, analysts need to address all of the critical components and their
nonlinear interactions. More foreign aid to a post-conflict country, for
example, should be expected to do no good if the security situation is
sufficiently abysmal.
* Figure S.1 is a “factor tree” depicting the factors that contribute to a phenomenon at a given
time. If one factor points to another, then more of the former will tend to increase the latter.
The notation “~and” means that, to a first approximation, some threshold values of all of the
factors are necessary for overall success. Such factor trees apply at a snapshot in time and do
not show feedback effects and other cross-factor interactions over time. Thus, they tell only
part of the story.

Summary xvii
Figure S.1 provides a static view, but the S&R challenge is
dynamic: Over time, “everything is connected to everything,” as
depicted in Figure S.2. This interconnectedness makes analytic work
difficult, but recognizing it is essential to meaningful communica-
tion and good S&R planning. Separating the two perspectives (of
Figures S.1 and S.2) allows us to modularize in functionally natural
ways and to reason in causal terms at a given time, while recognizing
that—over longer periods of time—interconnections are complex and
the usual concept of causality is troublesome. Sometimes, interactions
are more immediate.
A third element of our system approach is recognizing that the
effects of an approach, or of individual factors, depend on the context,
i.e., the situation or case. As an example, increasing intervenor troops
to stabilize a chaotic situation (a first case) may initially be effective
and greeted with enthusiasm, but—if foreign troops become associ-
ated with occupation rather than stabilization (a second case)—more
of them may worsen a situation rather than improve it.
Alternative courses of action, then, need to be assessed as a func-
tion of case, perhaps as illustrated schematically by Table S.1, which
imagines four factors. Each row would represent a different case. The
table also recognizes (in the last column) that, in the realm of S&R,

choosing an approach is fraught with uncertainties. Thus, the approach
should include hedging actions and monitoring to allow subsequent
adaptations. This is consistent with the experience of practitioners.
Against this background, the next four sections discuss the four
components of the S&R challenge. They are followed by some ana-
lytic observations and a short set of conclusions. The full monograph

An Integrating Conceptual Model
Establishing security is a sine qua non for success in S&R: Without
establishing a fair degree of security first, it is nearly impossible to pro-
ceed effectively on the other fronts. Subsequently, how quickly the
quality of security improves further will depend in part on progress on
the other component efforts. Although we focus primarily on what are
nominally post-conflict interventions, some level of insurgency (resis-
tance) may continue, and the level may escalate suddenly. Thus, deal-
ing with and deterring increases of resistance is a major part of estab-
lishing security.
The scholarly literature on aspects of establishing security is frag-
mented, but we constructed a unifying conceptual model that draws
on concepts implicit in the various literatures. Figure S.3 is a top-level
view of the conceptual model in the form of a factor tree indicating, at
a snapshot in time, what factors affect degree of security. The values of
those factors can depend on previous values of the other factors.

Summary xix
The issue highlighted at the top of Figure S.3 is the degree of secu-
rity. This is shown as depending primarily on the resistance effort, the
security effort, favorability of circumstances, and something we call
the “requirements function.” The resistance and security efforts depend
on the size and quality of forces, their strategy and tactics (e.g., purely
kinetic or population-centric), their coherence, and their sustainability.
Favorability of circumstances relates to case. For example, an insur-
gency may be assisted by terrain that provides cover, or by the existence
of sanctuary in neighboring countries. As indicated at the bottom left
of the figure, both public support and external foreign support for the
opposition are also important—not just by providing resources, but
through mechanisms such as tolerating the opposition’s presence rather

than informing authorities or by arguing the case for the opposition
internationally.
We highlight the requirements function because it is currently
unclear how much security effort is “enough,” even if we know how to
characterize resistance and situation. This can be seen in today’s opera-
tions in Afghanistan. Historical experience suggests the need for far
more “boots on the ground” than exist currently. However, the new
technology-intensive tactics may prove to be a big force multiplier. That
history has not yet been written.
Finally, along the bottom of Figure S.3 are boxes indicating fac-
tors, such as the level of crime and lawlessness, that have cross-cutting
effects on the factors in the tree. Some such effects may be positive or
negative, as indicated by a + or – symbol.

Figure S.5 addresses the key issue of whether the opposition
chooses to resist, i.e., to restart, or escalate, conflict. Figure S.5 reflects
both rational-choice modeling and recognition of other factors. If fully
rational, the opposition’s leaders effectively consider the pros and cons
of the alternatives and their probabilities. They consider not just their
“best guesses” about what would happen, but also best-case and worst-
case variants. For example, they may see the most likely outcome of
cooperation (right side) as their participation in government and a
degree of rights and services. However, a darker possibility (risk) is that

the government will renege and repress further opposition brutally once
the opposition leaders come out of hiding and lay down arms. Looking
to the option to restart conflict (left side), the opposition might expect
a long struggle with no clear-cut victory or defeat, but might also see
the alluring possibility of decisive victory at some point (upside poten-
tial). However, it might see the risk that, if war starts up again, the state
would achieve a total victory, with no incentive for accommodation or
inclusion; the opposition might be annihilated, not just defeated. Even
a highly rational opposition has difficulties making choices given such
uncertainties.
Reality is even more complicated because decisions are not fully
rational, even though most of the literature uses a rational-choice
model. The blood may be running so hot that any suggestion of com-
promise by either side’s leadership will be unacceptable to its con-
stituents. Conversely, if a leadership has the desire to fight on (or is
more risk-taking in nature), the rank and file may be too war-weary to
comply. Both practitioners and scholars refer to windows of opportu-
nity and vulnerability.
Finally, those making the decisions are often far more concerned with
personal or in group survival and power than with what might be best for
the people at large. Thus, even if “rational,” leaders’ actions may injure
their country.
Clearly, the ability of outsiders to predict what the state or oppo-
sition will do in a given post-conflict situation will often be quite lim-
ited. Nonetheless, this model identifies the factors and considerations
at work.
Measuring the Constructs of the Security Model
The scholarly literature does not define how to measure the constructs
described above, but we have suggestions:
• Degree of security can probably be measured by using an index
variable of the sort familiar to social scientists. Having a uniform
standard would allow semi-quantitative discussion good enough
for discussing alternative strategies.
Summary xxiii
• Security effort could be measured with “equivalent scores” reflect-
ing number of personnel, equipment and modernization, qual-
ity, and combined-arms mix. Such scoring has long been used
for good-enough calculations in force planning and operational
planning.
• Resistance could be measured similarly, but would also need to
reflect the differences between, e.g., active and passive support by
the population.
• It might prove possible to classify situations and, for each such
case, reflect the effects of modern technology and tactics as “mul-
tipliers” of the security and resistance efforts.
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions
General Observations
The second component of S&R noted in Figure S.1 is political, dealing
with establishing effective governance in a country that is at peace with
its neighbors and responsive to the concerns of its citizens. That might
be accomplished in innumerable ways, but intervenors often plunge
ahead in ways reflecting their own history and ways of doing things,
which can be a poor fit for the country in question for reasons of his-
tory, culture, and circumstance.
What, then, are the bare essentials? The core requirements? The
three most fundamental are that the government is
• Stable: Free of internal or external threats to the nation, its consti-
tution, and its governmental system.
• Functioning: Able to take and implement effective decisions, pro-
viding core services to the nation’s people.
• Legitimate and Accountable: Subject to censure or removal if offi-
cials violate established rules, laws, and rights; and legitimate
internationally.
Figure S.6 summarizes these in the form of a corresponding factor
tree identifying general factors contributing to the quality of gover-

nance, independent of its precise form. As shown at the bottom, suc-
cess depends also on capability, capacity, and implementation (e.g.,
including control of corruption, which can infect all aspects of S&R).
Real-world governments may fall short in some factors but still be “ade-
quate” in some sense. In principle, an autocratic government can be
high-functioning even if it has little other political legitimacy. A demo-
cratic government may have high legitimacy but be dysfunctional.
A considerable degree of scholarly consensus exists on political
goals to be emphasized (which relate closely to the factors in Figure S.1),
particularly (1) dispersing benefits, (2) assuring that factions participate
in governance and decisionmaking, (3) establishing barriers against
excessive centralization and exclusion, and (4) creating self-enforcing
mechanisms to assure accountability and responsiveness. However,

identifying such general goals is one thing; choosing among approaches
to governance is another, as is deciding on criteria of adequacy.
Attempting to actually create or enhance a government raises sen-
sitive issues, such as (1) partitioning as an option for a post-conflict situ-
ation, (2) different regime types, (3) differing arrangements for power-
sharing, (4) connecting the government to the people (i.e., establishing
legitimacy), and (5) enforcement of state-society obligations. What is
feasible and desirable depends on the situation, including the history
of how the war came about in the first place, root problems, and the
nature of leaders and parties, who often operate for selfish purposes.
Such social-science emphasis on context dependence is sometimes dis-
appointing to those looking for formulas, but the discussion has an
important implication for intervenors:
An early priority should be understanding: the country’s human,
economic, and cultural make-up; sources of contention; capac-
ities and objectives of the factions; available state-building
options; and an honest assessment of intervenors’ commitment
and capabilities.
This would be unexceptionable except that intervenors often do not
build this base of information early, but rather proceed apace with
insufficient knowledge.
Political Dilemmas
Pursuing broad goals is difficult because intervenors almost invari-
ably encounter dilemmas. Not only do they find competing “theories”
about how to proceed, they also find that any approach taken is likely
to have significant side effects. Table S.2 describes three conflicting
paradigms that have been used by U.S. policymakers over the past sev-
eral decades—all of which are still in play. Controlled state-building
sees economic development as the primary engine. Liberal-democratic
state-building emphasizes inclusion and democratization. Decentral-
ized S&R suggests minimalist objectives overall (primarily stabiliza-
tion) and stresses “bottom-up” developments in which local communi-
ties and power holders set priorities, in which case governance is more
distributed and local.
xxvi Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Upon reviewing these conflicting paradigms and a long list of
common political dilemmas, we identified three composite dilemmas
that are common in S&R:
• Inclusion: Should the approach emphasize short-term political
order, which might translate into military solutions followed by
autocracy and repression, or should it emphasize negotiated solu-
tions that may be more inclusive and less repressive, but might
also be fragile and even ineffective?
• State Capacity: Should the approach favor a strong and efficient
central state, which will probably require high cost and extended
commitments, or should it emphasize achieving more informal
governance quickly and at lower cost, but with the resulting gov-
ernment quite possibly being unable to provide services effectively?

Summary xxvii
• Transition: Should the approach emphasize institutions and prac-
tices good for securing an end to war, or institutions better suited
to the long term, with the dilemma being that power relation-
ships created to promote an end to war tend to resist subsequent
transitions?
The dilemmas are real and no formulaic solutions exist. None-
theless, we can offer admonitions and suggestions, as summarized in
Table S.3. If a relatively inclusive and legitimate state exists that exter-
nal intervenors are willing to support, then one of the most impor-
tant tools for stabilization is to reduce state vulnerability by reducing
resources available to the opposition. This may require regional security
arrangements, especially when neighboring states support insurgency
or other mischief or are part of a solution. Other mechanisms include
buyer cartels and neotrusteeships (i.e., governance that includes sig-
nificant multilateral external control, as occurred in Bosnia and East

Timor, among many other cases). These are especially useful when
insurgents are using “lootable resources,” such as oil or diamonds, to
fund their activities.
Achieving an appropriate power balance is often difficult (as in
today’s Iraq), but mechanisms include constitutional guarantees, inter-
national peacekeepers, and carrots and sticks to influence leaders. Early
on, power-balance issues can be crucial. The literature warns against
creating incentives to change facts on the ground (e.g., seizures of ter-
ritory) during negotiations. It also suggests that any incongruence
between legal/constitutional dictates and those that actually apply on
the ground will have to be enforced by external parties, which sug-
gests that negotiators limit their aspirations in what will be enforceable
later. Planning transitions is another aspect of S&R, since power bases
change and incentives are needed to encourage leaders, and the people
more generally, to join in developing institutions and activities under
the rule of law.
Table S.4 suggests how strategy, including positive and negative
inducements, might vary across cases differing in whether the external
circumstances for negotiated peace are favorable (e.g., are third parties
willing to provide guarantees; are neighboring countries supportive of
or hostile to peace), whether the opposition is judged to be ultimately
reconcilable, and whether the opposition enjoys broad popular sup-
port. Table S.4 lists eight cases, defined according to these factors in
the leftmost four columns. In the more unfavorable cases (e.g., case 8),
the strategy (column 5) should focus on weakening the opponent, as
indicated in later columns by, e.g., cutting off resources and seeking to
work with other regional states. It might also include (not shown) look-
ing for ways to improve reconcilability (e.g., wait for a change of leaders
or objective realities as seen by the opposition leader). In more favorable
cases, some aspects of the intervenor’s approach may be straightfor-
ward, but others less so. For example (cases 5 and 6, in which regional
circumstances may not be favorable), it may be necessary to provide
“physical” guarantees by maintaining international peacemakers or
guaranteeing intervention to enforce the protections that are essential
in enticing the opposition to pursue peace. We see Table S.4 as the
sketch of a tentative framework for making distinctions and commu-

nicating, although it will often be very difficult even to know which
case applies. Is the opposition really irreconcilable as it claims? Are the
promises of a neighboring state credible or mere deviousness? Such
problems are visible today in Afghanistan and related negotiations with
Pakistan and Iran. In any case, constructs such as a more fleshed-out
version of Table S.4 could be helpful in guiding discussion, although
they would at best sharpen issues rather than resolve them.
Looking back to Table S.3, its last item deals with another cross-
cutting dilemma, whether to encourage and work through a central-
ized government or instead deal with decentralized elements of gov-
ernance, including relatively informal versions where local customs
and processes are a part of governance. Choices must be case-specific.
In Afghanistan, for example, the central government has always been
weak, with most governance being local and sometimes informal.
Working with local leaders has many advantages, such as reduced costs
and encouraging a bottom-up development of leaders and governance
that can bring with it legitimacy. However, it is more difficult to deal
with multiple leaderships; there are reasons for favoring a strong state,
such as improving ability to defend against neighbors and economies
of scale; and local governance may seem less desirable and benign if
it comes with a tradition of discrimination or abuse of minorities or
women, criminal control, or highly intolerant religious interpretations
(as with the Taliban). Thus, the dilemma is nontrivial. Table S.5 sum-
marizes some of the pros and cons of working through informal gov-
ernance mechanisms.
Establishing Favorable Social Conditions
Initial Observations
The third component of our system structure deals with social matters.
The social component is dismayingly broad and notoriously difficult
to affect, especially for intervenors. Regrettably, we were unable in our
study to deal in depth with such issues as the implications of tribal
competition, corruption, or organized crime. Instead, we focused on
the importang but more humble challenge of achieving a degree of trust
Summary xxxi
and cooperation among disputing factions in a culturally appropriate
manner. As noted repeatedly in the scholarly literature, achieving a
degree of trust and cooperation is essential for success (not just a nice-
to-have objective pursued by idealists)—and can be feasible despite
past history. A great deal is known from social science about how to
proceed, and—significantly—about pitfalls and naivetés to avoid.
A starting point is recognizing the different types of trust, as sum-
marized in Table S.6, which fall into two broad categories: “calculation-
based trust” and “relationship-based trust.” The former requires only
that each party concludes that the other can be trusted on a specific
matter because it is in its interests to cooperate. Relationship-based
trust is different, and grows with improved understanding and the
discovery of some common concerns and goals. Both kinds of trust
improve over time with positive experiences and, of course, suffer from
negative experiences.
Distrust is more than the lack of trust. Not trusting someone has a
passive connotation. Active distrust is characterized by fear, skepticism,
and vigilance. Even if the level of trust is low, if the more active sense
of distrust can be reduced, then dealings among people may include
formal courtesies and arms-length interactions, whereas if the level of

distrust is high, there may be active fear, paranoia, and the perceived
need to attack preemptively.
Prescriptions for Trust-Building
Figure S.7 summarizes a great deal of social science on how to build
degrees of trust and cooperation. Doing so includes orchestrating suc-
cessful contacts and joint activities, building familiarity with each oth-
er’s concerns and narratives, creating structural and other incentives
for at least limited cooperation, and providing education that encour-
ages understanding and toleration while undercutting hatred and neg-
ative stereotypes. Even modest progress on these matters can have large
effects well before trust is deep and enduring. This said, much can
go wrong with poorly designed efforts. Contact and the experience of
trying to work together can, for example, deepen hostilities and rein-
force prejudices.

Establishing Favorable Economic Conditions
Why Post-Conflict Economics Is Different
The last of our four components (from Figure S.1) is economic. The
economic dimensions of S&R are numerous, complex, and ridden with
what are or often appear to be dilemmas. Figure S.8 is a general factor-
tree depiction of what contributes to a healthy economy. As indicated
at the bottom, economic health also depends on security, governance,
and social conditions. This depiction could apply to either post-conflict
or normal development settings, but with differences relating to the
relative intensity of effort on different factors, the sequencing of those
efforts, the type of aid employed, and the type of market system used.
For a given country, some of the branches will be much more problem-
atic than others. Thus, Figure S.8 is useful for seeing the whole, but not
for deciding what approach to take.

Indeed, perhaps the most important conclusion from our review
is, bluntly,
Economists seeking to advise in post-conflict circumstances must
adjust their thinking substantially: The usual paradigms of “good
economics” are counterproductive.
The differences between normal and post-conflict economics have
been at the heart of bitter disagreements over the years between some
development economists on the one hand and the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the other. Often, policies have
included immediate and unremitting fiscal and monetary austerity—
including not printing money, cutting public spending, setting high
interest rates, and constraining credit—all of which can keep inflation
down and decrease debt. For a post-conflict situation, however, interve-

nors must worry first about the short run; they want to see that people
have incomes so that money can start flowing through the system. The
actions may seem to be “political” and be perceived negatively by some,
but the principle is that the best economics in a post conflict situation is
heavily political and social. Jump-starting the economy is the primary
objective, although laying the foundations for sound longer-term eco-
nomics is also essential. Table S.7 summarizes differences between eco-
nomics for normal development and for post-conflict settings. Theory
and data agree on these matters, and consensus is emerging among
development economists even though battles continue more broadly.
In recent times, even the World Bank and IMF have relaxed their strin-
gent austerity policies in some post-conflict situations.
Economic Practices for the Post-Conflict Situation
Economic strategy must reflect country-specific circumstances and his-
tory, but the literature supports some overarching themes, which are
meaningful because so much past practice has violated the correspond-
ing principles:
Table S.7
Economic Planning in Normal Versus Post-Conflict Development

Economic Planning in
Post-Conflict Circumstances
Focus is on medium- and long-term
goals.
Focus must often be on short-term
(potentially distortionary) emergency
programs.
Choices are largely merit-based,
without regard to group affiliations.
Choices must often include preferential
efforts to assist groups affected by
conflict and by social inclusion policies.
Foreign assistance is low and stable. Foreign assistance spikes immediately
after conflict, varying thereafter.
Government institutions establish and
carry out rule of law.
Foreign troops support or possibly replace
weak or nonexistent government
institutions (e.g. police, army, judiciary)
to promote rule of law.
International community need not
involve itself in the country’s politics.
International involvement in country
politics is often intrusive and intense.

Expectations. Expectations are a problem. Too often, those
involved in S&R set high goals, not realizing that doing so undercuts
political support and diminishes the government. The more realistic
description for the short term would be jump starting. What is needed
most is to get the engine started and to establish attitudes of respon-
sible local ownership.

and analyzing data to help assess whether progress is greater where
jump-starting actions are employed. This can help both in manage-
ment and in building support for the activities, individuals, and insti-
tutions responsible. When the actions are not making a positive differ-
ence, adaptations may be needed. Metrics are important, of course, but
should be developed within a system framework because more narrow
metrics will often have very troublesome side effects.
Simplicity and Flexibility. The need for “simplicity” is often men-
tioned, almost as a cliché. However, the admonition has substantial
content. Strategy should not have too many components and, certainly,
should not try to drive too many factors or be sensitive to intricate
interconnections and subordinate controls. “Moving in the right direc-
tion” along several lines of effort and “doing essential coordination”
conveys the idea. Complex orchestration, as is common and necessary
for efficiency in modern commercial settings, is the opposite. Simplic-
ity can also improve transparency and increase buy-in and support by
local stakeholders. Finally, plans need to be flexible, so that if activities
are not working (as will often be the case), this fact will be recognized
and adaptations can be made. Measures to identify failure and enable
smooth changes need to be planned and agreed on in advance. This
is easier when plans are simple. Interestingly, these themes will all be
familiar to military commanders who deal with analogous issues in
their traditional domain.
Figure S.9 summarizes how priorities and intensity of effort might
reasonably change between the short, mid, and long terms. We see this
structuring of priorities over time as resolving some of the apparent
dilemmas in the economic component of S&R: Some issues are not so
much true dilemmas as conflicts of competing theories due to failures
to distinguish sharply among time periods.
Summary xxxvii
Special Issues of Foreign Aid
Special economic issues arise with respect to foreign aid because of
numerous tensions:
• short-term versus longer-term objectives
• traditional versus more stabilization-specific objectives
• strengthening government by funneling aid through it and allow-
ing the related buildup of patronage systems versus improving the
efficiency of aid by delivering directly to the population
• strengthening central government and improving some kinds of
efficiency by working through that central government versus
emphasizing bottom-up developments at the local and province
levels
• imposing conditionalities to improve national performance versus
attending quickly to urgent needs.
Table S.8 is our effort to resolve the tensions. The conflict between
short-term and long-term issues is less of a dilemma than a matter of
diagnosing problems and recognizing what is feasible for the particu-
lar country at the particular time: It matters, for example, whether the

country has suffered grievous damage and whether it had or still has a
substantial base of human capital.
The tension between traditional development and stabilization-
specific objectives is sometimes very troublesome, but one element of
mitigating the tensions is to improve the way in which different organs
of government and different agencies relate to each other and to non-
government organizations (NGOs). Military-style “command and
control” is most unlikely, but much more coordination, collaboration,
and even integration may be possible.
A fundamental issue—sometimes a dilemma and sometimes just
a difficult issue to diagnose and deal with—is whether to support and
strengthen the central government (a natural tendency for the United
States and other developed-country intervenors) or to take the approach
of strengthening governance from the bottom up by working through
local leaders. Which approach is better will depend on the specific case,
but a cross-cutting principle is that
Whichever strategy is adopted, implementation should support
leaders at all levels who actually provide services to their people.

Focus conditionalities on matters uniquely important
to leaders, while not putting at risk matters
important to the population at large, e.g., exclude
conditionality on humanitarian activities. Include
institution-building in the conditions.
Working through or

Base strategy on circumstances, i.e., the governance
quality and the governance capacity.
Summary xxxix
It should help to strengthen their reputations and base of sup-
port and power and to improve the legitimacy of the governance
system. Such leaders will use or build networks of people that
they trust to get things done. Such leaders should be chosen by
the people, however, not by the intervenor.
Interestingly, this approach might be seen as building “patron-
age networks” in a pejorative sense, with elements that might be seen
as cronyism. However, it should also be seen positively as establish-
ing patronage networks with bottom-up “emergence” of talented,
dedicated, networked people strengthening the core of the nation.
Intervenors should influence leaders to be inclusive as they build their
networks.
Conditionalities are another common source of dispute. Con-
cerns such as fears of corruption or exclusion lead donor countries to
set requirements to assure that their assistance is well used. However,
these conditionalities often have bad effects on the people. The primary
admonition is that conditionalities should be focused on influencing
leaders while not interfering with immediate humanitarian efforts.
Conditions should often be tied to institution-building.
The last of Table S.8’s issues has to do with the tension mentioned
in earlier paragraphs, whether to work through the government or act
more directly. We conclude that the issue is one of correct diagnosis,
i.e., in identifying the relevant case. As indicated in Table S.9, very dif-
ferent approaches are suggested merely by recognizing the quality and
capacity of the government. If both are lacking (case 1), direct delivery
makes sense, especially for short-term humanitarian relief. At the other
extreme (a government with relatively high quality and capacity, as in
case 4), every effort should be made to work through the government
rather than undercutting and delegitimizing it, and rather than setting
up ad hoc processes without the benefit of local knowledge and exper-
tise. For in-between cases, hybrid strategies are appropriate, along with
adaptation. Intervenor resources may supplement government forces
but be clearly in an assistance role. In the event of rank incompetence
or total corruption, however, a more direct role is called for. This typol-
xl Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
ogy is simple but nontrivial, because intuition is often wrong and pres-
sures are often mischievous.
Analytic Observations
Most of our study was organized around the four components of S&R
from Figure S.1, but in addressing those we reviewed a great deal of
analytical literature and, in the course of doing so and making our
own assessments, we reached a number of conclusions significant in
their own right.
We drew heavily on the empirical literature. Empirical evidence,
however, comes in many forms, such as case histories, more-than-
anecdotal practitioner accounts, and statistical-empirical analysis.
Each has strengths and weaknesses. We usually found case histories to
be the most useful because they provide rich contextual information
and identify “real” factors rather than the variables that happen to be
convenient for data analysis. Ultimately, as illustrated in recent years
by prominent researchers, there is great opportunity to combine case-
history information and quantitative analysis in research, but that is
quite demanding.

Summary xli
It is appropriate to comment specifically on statistical-empirical
work because of a common misperception that it is more rigorous and
policy-relevant than is the case. Some even equate it with “evidence-
based research.” In fact, we (and the strongest articles of the litera-
ture) are especially reluctant to draw policy conclusions from the past
statistical-empirical work relating to S&R. The reasons are many. First,
much of the work has been overly “macro” in nature and dependent on
historical data that did not stem from the controlled experiments to
which the methods apply. After a decade of study and counterstudy, it
is clear that much of the analysis has been afflicted by hidden variables,
endogeneity, “coding issues,” and a sensitivity of results to the detailed
form of equations used for the statistical analysis (the so-called “spec-
ification problem”). We find that very few results about the relative
importance of factors have held up well across analyses. Where a factor
has been shown to correlate with past results, the correlation has often
not been truly causal. Further, where a factor has not correlated with
past results, we find that has not necessarily meant much. For example,
foreign aid has often not had hoped-for effects, but the aid may have
been wasted because of poor security, governance, or implementation
that precluded its usefulness. In summary, the rich back-and-forth in
the quantitative-analysis literature has been very helpful and insight-
ful in identifying factors, influences, and issues, but not very useful in
assessing the relationships among factors or their strengths.
Despite these cautions, past “negative” empirical results from
quantitative analysis (i.e., an instrument didn’t seem to help) should be
extremely sobering to those advocating the use of a particular instru-
ment. If the instrument has not been effective previously, then why
should it be more valuable this time? What will be different—and
even if there are differences (and there always are), why should they be
thought to be so important as to lead to different results? The salience
of this admonition was illustrated in the Iraq war and its aftermath.
Illustrative Results
As noted above, many factors have been studied for their potential
value in statistical prediction of war occurring or, given a cessation of
war, of peace persisting. Most conclusions have proven soft after suc-
xlii Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
cessive studies and critiques, but much has been learned. Table S.10
is our selected abstraction from the literature that illustrates some of
the issues. Looking at the first row of the table, an early conclusion
was that prospects for peace have been best when the previous war
ended decisively, an intuitively sensible conclusion with troublesome
policy implications. Further study, however, has shown that “decisive-
ness” is too aggregated. Some analyses indicate that when rebels have
won decisively, prospects have been better than if the government won
(perhaps because the governments in question had problems that per-
sisted). Other studies find a different result (using a wider set of cases,
including cases with fewer casualties and less destruction), so the only
conclusion is probably that who wins matters. Significantly, analysis
indicates that intervention by external peacekeepers can trump the sig-

Summary xliii
nificance of the previous war’s decisiveness. Such scientific back-and-
forth is quite valuable for understanding factors and issues.
Looking to the second row, has ethnic hatred been a major factor?
By and large, the conclusion from a combination of evidence is that
ethnicity has not been a root cause, but rather a manufactured ral-
lying point exploited by demagogues. Unfortunately, once a war has
been fought with mobilization organized along ethnic lines, the ethnic
factors become independently significant. The existence of absolut-
ist objectives has also been studied and found significant. However,
it should surprise few readers that factions are sometimes more will-
ing to compromise than their rhetoric suggests and that, other times,
peace-seeking language disguises more malevolent intentions. The last
three items in Table S.10 (shown in bold) are those that we found had
persuasive and policy-relevant significance. Intervention and guaran-
tees by external powers have been correlated in the past with success,
which makes sense from theoretical considerations. If a faction is con-
templating a negotiated peace, it will be more willing to take risks if
there is some credible guarantor to step in if necessary and use its influ-
ence more generally to protect the faction’s interests. Continuing in
the table, recent research provides strong evidence that, with a good
specification, regime type is a strong statistical indicator of when civil
wars occur. Again, that is consistent with theoretical considerations.
It is also encouraging because regime type is something that can be
influenced. However, another part of the conclusion is that partial,
highly factionalized democracies—not uncommon in a post-conflict
situation—are especially fragile. Finally, we mention cutting off the
opposition’s resources. If the intervenor supports the government (per-
haps a newly formed government), then a major issue from the lit-
erature is that the opposition may well continue fighting if it has the
resources to do so. Both logic and statistical data support the idea that
cutting off such resources can be valuable.
xliv Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Research
We conclude from our work that the “system view” is both necessary
and helpful. The potential value of intervenor options depends on base-
line values of the security, political, social, and economic components;
on the direct ways in which the proposed options can affect them; and
on indirect effects (sometimes called second- and third-order effects).
Planners can benefit from having concepts of virtuous self-reinforcing
loops, as in the illustrative influence diagram in Figure S.10, where
progress in each component positively influences developments in
another. In the particular example (only one of many that could be

drawn), levels of self-reinforcing intergroup cooperation can help estab-
lish a norm of cooperation in political circles, which reduces the likeli-
hood of stalemate, thereby increasing government effectiveness. That
in turn reduces risk and increases cooperative behavior. Also, effec-
tive establishment of transitional justice can legitimize a new govern-
ment (at the possible cost of exacerbating residual tensions with the
society). Civil-society organizations can partner with government to
provide human services guided by government to increase social capital
via service delivery as well as perceptions of state capacity. Conversely,
political corruption decreases trust in all levels of society, both hori-
zontally and vertically. Political structures that encourage nepotism or
favoritism create disincentives to cooperation, which in turn decrease
economic opportunity, which creates more competition, and so forth.
Regrettably, the possibilities here work in both directions. Fail-
ure in one component can undercut progress in others. Side effects are
common. Moreover, most of the virtuous feedback effects do not occur
automatically, but must rather be planned for and enforced. That can
be difficult to achieve when the parties in question (e.g., a government
and a prime opposition party) are led by individuals or groups of indi-
viduals driven more by personal ambitions, greed, and power consider-
ations than by concern for the people at large.
Analytically, we see much value in “influence-diagram” depic-
tions for understanding potential effects and side effects, especially for
reasoning and communication. Many authors over the years (primar-
ily in other domains, including policy analysis and business planning)
have reached similar conclusions. We emphasize that the greatest value
is in “seeing” the relationships, not literally building computer models
that generate “predicted” results over time. Such models could be quite
valuable for exploratory analysis, which in the future could provide
useful analytic insights about prospects for success and about possible
side effects to plan against, but for now the more qualitative influence
diagrams (and factor trees presented earlier) are the most useful.
Operations as Experiments
Because of the uncertainties and complications discussed above, those
developing strategy for S&R will be well advised to think of the chosen
xlvi Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
strategy as an experiment, one that will probably have to be adapted
to reinforce what is working and to find substitutes for what does
not. This requires monitoring developments, which requires signposts
of success or failure. Metrics can either help or hurt in this regard,
depending on how well they are constructed and how well they reflect
the idiosyncratic nature of the particular intervention. We believe that
improved metrics can be constructed using the results of our survey
and its system depictions (including competing influence diagrams
that represent differences of expert opinion).
Intervernors are also likely to discover that the problems they are
addressing are what theorists call “wicked” problems. At the outset,
there is no unique solution to be found by merely applying an algo-
rithm: Antagonists do not yet know what they will, in the end, find
satisfactory; objective factors, such as the economy’s development, are
not yet realistically predictable; the quality and motives of emergent
leaders are yet to be determined; and what intervenors and the world
community will find it possible to sustain will be dictated by future
and partially unpredictable events. When dealing with wicked prob-
lems, process is important so that, if the stars align themselves properly,
an adequate solution can emerge in due course.
Suggestions for Research
Research in S&R will continue, and we offer some suggestions:
• Reject narrow approaches to “evidence-based research” that
depend strictly on quantitative methods. A mix of methods is a
stronger approach to using empirical information. Qualitative
methods, particularly case studies and comparative case studies,
are often more insightful.
• Within quantitative work, increase emphasis on “micro-level”
quantitative analysis in a single country, so as to hold more con-
textual elements more or less constant.
Summary xlvii
• Disaggregate to recognize different phases or regions within a
single country as substantially different cases.
• Commission experiments in operational theaters large enough to
permit using different instruments in different areas or time peri-
ods; use people trained in quasi-experimental methods to design
meaningful efforts.*
• Support further work with “agent-based rational-choice
decisionmaking models” to anticipate (and in some cases even
predict) the maneuverings of political factions competing for
influence by forging alliances.
• Encourage quantitative analyses that are more theory-informed
in a system-theory sense, rather than based on traditional linear
regression and minor variants. Develop a new approach to metrics
accordingly.
• Adapt the methods of multiresolution modeling and exploratory
analysis to social-science analysis on S&R.
* Although adding complexity to their efforts, operational commanders could see this as a
portfolio approach to managing risk, one offering an empirical basis for reinforcing success-
ful approaches. Although we recommend such experiments, we caution against high expec-
tations because data will often prove too sparse for the number of factors at play.

CHAPTER ONE
Introduction
Paul K. Davis
Scope
This monograph deals with social science relating to the higher-level
challenges affecting whole-of-government activities in post-conflict
situations involving stability and reconstruction (S&R) operations.1
Thus, we address issues from the early phases, in which establishing
security is primary, to later phases, in which reconstruction and what
some would call nation-building take place. We do this without preju-
dice as to how ambitious intervention operations should be.
The research base on which we drew included numerous subject
areas, such as (1) civil wars, conflict resolution, and conflict prevention;
(2) developmental economics; (3) political development and political
economy; and (4) stability operations, peacekeeping, and intervention.
The literature also reflected many disciplines, notably economics, polit-
ical science, sociology, psychology, history, and peace and conflict stud-
ies. Although not highlighted in the book, our work was informed by
the emerging science of complex adaptive systems and by past policy-
analytic work using system dynamics and related methods. The sources
of information included academia, think tanks, and governmental and
international organizations. 2
Background
As observed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in a pivotal For
eign Affairs article (Gates, 2009), the United States continued for years
2 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
to put near-total emphasis on planning for possible future wars with
advanced rogue states or future near-peer threats despite the nation
being almost constantly embroiled in actual operations from 1990
onward, operations variously labeled as examples of traditional war,
irregular warfare, hybrid warfare, complex operations, counterinsur-
gency, peace enforcement, and peacekeeping. It was only after major
setbacks in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 that a shift in emphasis began that
eventually put a good deal more effort into preparing for the demands
of irregular operations and dealing with complex post-conflict situ-
ations. Operationally, the Army and Marine Corps substantially
revamped counterinsurgency doctrine.3 In strategic planning, Gates’s
demand for a rebalancing of efforts became the principal theme of the
2010 subsequent Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) (Gates, 2010).
One aspect of the shift was a challenge posed to the analytic
community, broadly construed: How should analysis be adapted to
meet the needs of the here-and-now challenges? The Department of
Defense’s (DoD’s) analytic toolkit had been honed during the Cold
War and refined further in the 1990s, but its focus was almost exclu-
sively on medium-sized or large “kinetic wars.” Although many stud-
ies were accomplished on subjects such as military operations other
than war (MOOTW), military operations in urban terrain (MOUT),
and small-scale contingencies (SSCs), most of these were not especially
“analytic” if by that one means characterized by theories, models, data,
and experiments. The department established an analytic agenda of
building analytic capabilities to fill the gaps while continuing to pro-
vide the basis for longer-term work with future wars in mind (Rums-
feld, 2006). An important aspect of the gap-filling work in that ana-
lytic agenda was to better understand lessons from the social sciences
that should inform the work of analysts throughout the department. It
was all too evident from the experience of here-and-now military chal-
lenges that many of the issues being faced were quintessentially human
issues, rather than issues describable by physics and engineering.
An early step in DoD’s effort was to commission an integrat-
ing review by RAND of the social science relevant to terrorism and
counterterrorism (Davis and Cragin, 2009). The present monograph
reports on a follow-on effort requested by DoD, a request made in the
Introduction 3
context of what was then called security, stabilization, transition, and
reconstruction (SSTR)—i.e., whole-of-government activities related to
everything from stabilization to reconstruction. The study was intended
to serve multiple agencies of government, but it was also recognized
that, in practice, military commanders find themselves involved in all
aspects of post-conflict operations—sometimes as an enabler of activi-
ties by civilian government organizations and sometimes as temporary
stand-ins for those or other organizations in a high-threat environ-
ment.4 Social science has insights to offer for that larger context.
The questions posed at the project’s outset asked, How are S&R
operations affected by
1. levels of economic development or the dominant system of eco-
nomic production?
2. the ethnic and cultural diversity of a population?
3. geographical and topographical factors?
4. historical legacies, such as a background in colonial rule, democ-
racy, absence of strong governance, or rampant corruption?
5. social conditions?
6. special underlying levels of conflict in society?
7. possible exogenous factors?
The study, then, was to be more broadly strategic than narrowly
military. Finally, we hoped to provide insights about potential levers of
influence, i.e., to identify classes of actions that could be taken by the
United States, other countries, and nongovernmental organizations,
directly or indirectly, to advance U.S. interests and help stability opera-
tions to succeed.
Prior Work
In conducting our research we drew on prior efforts that have also
taken a broad view.5 In particular, the U.S. Institute of Peace has
been a major contributor, providing a comprehensive reader (Crocker,
Hampson, and Aall, 2007), a primer on international intervention
4 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
that underscores the paramount importance of establishing security
(Covey, Dziedzic, and Hawley, 2005), broad principles for stabiliza-
tion and reconstruction (United States Institute of Peace and United
States Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute, 2009),
and a compendium of possible metrics (Agoglia, Dziedzic, and Sotirin,
2011). Other practitioners have provided overviews that explain moti-
vations for international intervention and what is involved in states
being able and willing to intervene constructively (Ghani and Lock-
hart, 2008).6
More generally, the literature is rich in information, ideas, and
debate—as befits the term social science. A number of scholars are gen-
erally positive about the possibilities of S&R (Berdal and Economides,
2007; Call, 2008; Doyle and Sambanis, 2006; Fukuyama, 2004;
Dobbins et al., 2003)—despite emphasizing its inherent complexity
and difficulty. Others are more skeptical (e.g., Brownlee, 2007; Coyne,
2007; Englebert and Tull, 2008; Etzioni, 2010). Fukuyama (2004)
provides a good theoretical overview of state-building broadly.7 He
explores strengthening state institutions with a focus on public admin-
istration. Others (Paris, 2004; Barnett, 2006) look at post-conflict sta-
bilization from a perspective akin to political theory.
The growing literature on fragile and failed states is particularly
relevant to this volume because such states have many of the same
issues as post-conflict states—indeed, often are post-conflict states.
Kaplan (2008) and Ghani and Lockhart (2008) offer overarching the-
ories of why states fail in the first place, which are broadly relevant
to post-conflict stabilization, including establishing security. Kaplan
emphasizes economic forces. Ghani and Lockhart discuss those, but
also the “weakness of the sovereign” in many failed states. Numerous
studies examine the conditions and causes of violence and state col-
lapse for particular regions, such as Africa (Lemarchand, 2009; Bates,
2008; Herbst, 2000).
Past RAND work on nation-building has been broad, and focused
primarily on practical policy lessons (Dobbins et al., 2003, 2005, 2007,
2008a, 2008b). Some primary conclusions are as follows:
Introduction 5
• Overall level of effort by the intervening powers, “measured in
time, manpower and money” is the most important controlla-
ble factor in a post-conflict environment (Dobbins et al., 2003,
p. xxv). Further, there is no “quick route” to lasting peace;
stabilization takes time.
• Multilateral strategies of nation-building have advantages over
lead-nation strategies. They can be more complex and time-
consuming but tend to bring about more thorough transforma-
tions, with resulting higher levels of ultimate stability.
• Casualties fall as the number of troops dedicated to stabilization
operations increases.
The first and third of these relate directly to establishing security.
Other RAND authors have addressed, e.g., organization for sta-
bility operations (Bensahel, 2007), the military’s role in economic
development (Crane et al., 2009), and an approach to counterinsur-
gency (Gompert et al., 2008). All of these benefited heavily from prac-
titioner experience.
Yet another aspect of prior work, although not nominally of the
“scholarly variety,” is important to note. That is the development of
updated doctrine for counterinsurgency mentioned earlier (Depart-
ment of the Army, 2007). The revised doctrine reflects not only endur-
ing lessons from history and previous doctrinal efforts but also research
by and advice from scholars, including anthropologists. The British
government has also published good discussions of what it calls the
“Comprehensive Approach” (Joint Doctrine and Concepts Centre,
2006) and principles (DFID, 2009).
Although the current volume was intended to draw primarily
from the academic literature, the practitioner literature is important
not only for the experience conveyed but also because in some cases
the lessons from practice (sometimes surprisingly encouraging) have
gone well beyond what scholarly theory currently deals with effectively.
Indeed, academic research would benefit greatly by some changes in
orientation and method, as discussed later. This will require more con-
text specificity, more factors, and a system perspective.
6 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Overarching Questions to Guide Research
When attempting to survey numerous vast literatures, it is essential
to have some overarching questions to guide the search and prioritize
the innumerable interesting topics. Based on an initial survey phase
in 2009, which culminated in a workshop that gathered a number of
prominent academic experts, we decided to focus on the following
questions, issues, and dilemmas.
Generic Issues
1. Typologies. Are there qualitatively different types of S&R opera-
tions (perhaps defined in terms of causes, characteristics, and
exogenous factors) that help assess feasibility and prospects? If
so, what are reasonable objectives and likelihoods of success for
the intervenor?
2. Driving Factors. For each member of the typology, what are the
key factors, challenges, dilemmas, and resources?
3. Monitoring. For each type, what should be monitored to assess
progress and prospects, and to trigger adaptivity?
The literature was especially helpful on the second item (driving
factors). It was not as helpful regarding typologies. There is some recent
work on metrics (Agoglia, Dziedzic, and Sotirin, 2011), but it is not
yet mature, and much remains to be done. We only touch upon the
subject here.
Recurring Dilemmas
Our initial research concluded that—looking across the vast
literature—certain recurring dilemmas loom large. The term dilemma
is appropriate, because those who seek to conduct a stability operation
and associated nation-building find themselves having to make diffi-
cult choices that cannot be made on the basis of some simple calcula-
tion, but instead require best-guess judgments about which course of
action is most likely to have the most favorable effects. The facts of the
situation are often ambiguous or uncertain, the experts often disagree
Introduction 7
vehemently (even on-scene experts), and each course of action can be
expected to have troublesome side effects. We concluded that we would
take particular pains to address these issues as best we could, either
by drawing directly from the scholarly literature or by attempting to
resolve the conflicts through analysis and synthesis. The dilemmas we
identified in the first phase of work (completed in September 2009)
were as follows:
1. Balance in Governance. How can a balance be struck among
government effectiveness, stability, responsiveness, and democ-
ratization (especially since institutions that strengthen progress
toward one of these goals can weaken progress toward another)?
2. Transition. How can the transition be made from externally
enforced arrangements to self-enforcing institutions?
3. Balance in Instruments. How can use of instruments of national
power be properly balanced when intervenors’ organs of power
are imbalanced?
4. Coherence in Command and Control. How can coherence be
achieved when intervenors and other participants have distinct
interests and objectives?
5. Short Term Versus Long Term. How can effective short-term eco-
nomic policies be pursued while also preparing for the longer
term? When and how can the transition be made?
6. Central Government. Should intervenors push for a strong cen-
tral government or a network of linked, locally responsive power
centers?
7. Freedom to Fail? How should the importance of “local own-
ership” be balanced against the imperative of demonstrating
concrete returns to peace or support for the legitimate govern-
ment? How does this balance change over time? Under what cir-
cumstances might local actors’ failures be acceptable, and when
would they entail unacceptably harmful consequences?
8. Reconciliation. How and under what circumstances should
former combatants be reintegrated?
8 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
9. Tilting? Where one group is stronger or more capable than
others, is stability enhanced by strengthening the stronger group
or putting limits on it?
10. Patronage? What is the balance of interests in the development
of patronage networks? Do they support or undermine stability?
11. Returns. Is stability generally enhanced if refugees and the
internally displaced are returned to their original residence or
resettled?
12. Corruption. What kinds and levels of corruption, if any, are
acceptable, and what kinds and levels of corruption will under-
mine stability operations?
As discussed in the latter portions of the book, we attempted to
view some of these dilemmas in groups.
Approach: The Necessity of a System Perspective
After our initial survey, it was apparent that an integrative monograph
would need to take a system perspective. Further, we would need to
impose analytic constructs of system thinking that are seldom evident
in the literatures on which we were drawing.
A System View and Analytic Hypotheses
Taking a system perspective is hardly controversial. It is almost a cliché
that stability operations must take, to use terms from the 2010 Qua-
drennial Defense Review, a “whole-of-government approach” that
addresses all of the “instruments of power.” 8 We have organized the
monograph accordingly so that all of the problem’s dimensions are
addressed to some extent. In addition, we found it difficult to make
sense of the literature without a core hypothesis that will be used guard-
edly throughout the monograph:
Assessing the potential successfulness of stability operations can
best be addressed with a system formulation in which the system
has four critical components: the quality of security, political,
social, and economic conditions. If any of these components fail,
Introduction 9
then—consistent with the adjective critical—we must expect the
system as a whole to fail.
If this is true, then it follows that increasing the effort in any one
critical component cannot compensate for failure in one or more of
the others. For an intervenor to do more of what he knows how to do,
and what he has the capacity to do, cannot fully compensate for abject
failures in critical processes for which the intervenor lacks sufficient
knowledge or capacity.
Further, under this hypothesis:
The critical components are interrelated over time. Sequencing
may be necessary because progress on one component may
depend fundamentally on prior progress on another.
This hypothesis has important analytic implications for interpret-
ing the scholarly literature, critiquing the knowledge base, construct-
ing theory and models to help inform thinking about and conduct of
stability operations, and conducting further empirical and theoretical
research.9 It means, for example, that the probability of success in a
stabilization operation would be essentially zero if failure occurred in
any of the critical components. In such cases, doubling or even tripling
the effort on the other critical components might accomplish nothing.
To relate this to intuition, it is perhaps evident that sending in a
small force of even very good soldiers will accomplish nothing to estab-
lish security in a large troubled area. How much is enough? Depend-
ing on circumstances, it might be modest (a thousand?) or enormous
(hundreds of thousands?) in terms of boots on the ground. Where
would the turning point be at which degree of security starts to build
quickly with additional effort? Where would be the point of diminish-
ing returns? Chapter Two discusses such issues.
As another example, if stability operations have failed in past
cases even when vast sums of money have been poured into economic
activities, it is not necessarily valid to conclude that such economic aid
is wasteful or irrelevant: It may be that the failures occurred because
of severe shortcomings (such as rampant and unrestrained corruption)
on the political, social, or security dimensions or in the administration
10 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
of the aid. This is not an idle speculation, but one that seems apt when
we look at listings of failed instances of stability efforts. Moreover, it
corresponds to the qualitative explanations given by many observers.
Another implication is that if our analytic hypothesis is correct,
then lack of correlation does not imply lack of causation. That is, a factor
may help “cause” something to happen in propitious cases, but the
causality can only be seen in certain circumstances that are not well
represented in the database. This is important for interpreting the lit-
erature, because so many of the research findings are otherwise para-
doxical or implausible. For example, increasing the extent of foreign
aid has not correlated well with success. That evidence should be (and
is) troubling, but understanding the reasons for the lack of success may
not be so straightforward.
Note that this analytic hypothesis also fits the frequently voiced
view of experts on the scene in a failing operation that “we can do
more, but the limiting factor is . . . and unless that turns around. . . .”
In thinking about Afghanistan today, for example, it is commonly
believed that the determining factor will be whether the Afghan gov-
ernment can achieve some minimal level of competence and deliver
some minimal level of governance.10
Another recurrent analytic problem in interpreting the literature
is that many researchers organize their analysis around convenient
measurables, which sometimes correlate with results. That, however,
may impede clear thinking about causation. If, for example, stabiliza-
tion efforts tend to succeed if they follow long, drawn-out, and inten-
sive conflict with a conclusive victor, one might infer that a would-be
intervenor would be wise to let the protagonists fight themselves into
exhaustion before intervening. That is almost surely true in some cir-
cumstances, but mistaking this for a general principle would be tragic
if it meant failing to assist early in circumstances where early interven-
tion could succeed.
Depicting System Relationships
Visual graphics are often helpful in communicating interrelationships
and system concepts. Earlier RAND work, on the social science of
counterterrorism, emphasized the value of simple depictions that seek
Introduction 11
only to identify the factors at work (doing so with hierarchical “factor
trees”) and some modest indication of how the factors interact in the
simplest cases (Davis and Cragin, 2009; Davis, 2009). In the current
work, however, it seemed crucial to include also simple depictions of
dynamics, because affecting those dynamics is at the very heart of sta-
bilization operations and related nation-building. Further, decades of
experience in other domains tell us that some of the most serious stra-
tegic-level errors are made as the result of a failure to understanding
the phasing of effects. Sometimes, for example, patience is called for
because favorable developments are underway even if results are not
yet visible. In other cases, alarmism is appropriate because of not-very-
visible unfavorable developments that are underway and that will be
quite troublesome unless stemmed early.
With this in mind, we use the following kinds of analytic repre-
sentation in this monograph.
Factor Trees. Figure 1.1 shows a factor-tree depiction relating the
four factors to success.11 This example includes an explicit “and” rela-
tionship, although—as noted in the figure—this should be interpreted
to mean that each factor’s quality must be “good enough,” as distinct
from very high. That is, the quality of governance, for example, need
not be up to Western standards to make stabilization feasible. Similarly
for the others.

Simple Dynamics. Figure 1.2 shows dynamics and interrelation-
ships of a different form. This might be seen as a variation of a simple
causal-loop diagram as used in the system dynamics methods pioneered
by Jay Forrester12 or of influence-diagram techniques, which have been
used for many years in diverse disciplines, including the study of man-
agerial and other social problems in organizations.13 We have used line
thickness and dashes to indicate something about importance and
sequencing, so that the picture conveys a story. Starting with a security
effort, improved security enables improvements in the political, eco-
nomic, and even social dimensions. Economic improvements reinforce
political and social dimensions quickly. Thereafter, improvements in
all of the dimensions feed back, reinforcing each other. To be sure, this
story is what is desired, not necessarily what transpires. Further, the
diagram can also be interpreted to mean that weakness in any dimen-
sion will weaken the others. This idealized image will not occur auto-
matically. Indeed, political progress may not help the economy without
sound policies being adopted; progress in health and education may
not help security or politics if the health/education assistance is focused
only in certain areas or serves only certain groups. More generally, vigi-
lance is needed to ensure that political, economic, and social progress
is fair and balanced and seen as aiding the legitimacy of the regime,

as well as increasingly effective. The primary point, then, is that the
dimensions are tightly connected—for both good and ill. It usually
makes sense to modularize as in Figure 1.1 and to treat the interactions
of Figure 1.2 as occurring on longer time scales, although interactions
can sometimes be more immediate.
Figure 1.3 provides an alternative depiction of dynamics. If rela-
tionships exist as in Figure 1.2, then the result over time might ideally
be as in Figure 1.3 (ideal because, realistically, even in a good case
there would be ups and downs rather than steady progress). Starting
from a very low base in the immediate post-conflict environment, a
combination of foreign and internal security forces are built up over
time. Economic aid starts early, but is modest and of a humanitarian
variety. Subsequently, it jump-starts a domestic economy, after which
progress is slower. As security improves, the domestic economy begins
to grow. That, in turn, enables gradual political and social improve-
ments. Again, the purpose of the diagram is merely to create an image
of what is being sought in a successful but not ideal intervention. Secu-
rity, however, is a sine qua non for progress on the other dimensions.

Case Dependence. A third element of our system approach is rec-
ognizing that how a course of action affects factors and what overall
approach should be taken depends on case—i.e., context or situation.
For example, increasing intervenor forces to stabilize a chaotic situa-
tion (one case) may be effective and appreciated, whereas doing so after
those forces come to be seen as occupiers (a different case) could be
counterproductive. An implication is that alternative courses of action
need to be assessed as a function of case, as suggested schematically
in Table 1.1. This notional decision aid imagines that “case” is deter-
mined by four factors. Each row in the table’s body is a different case.
For each, there is a suggestion approach (course of action) but also, as
indicated in the last column, suggested hedges. An approach should
include monitoring and hedges that will allow adaptations, which as
operators can attest, will often be necessary.
Structure of This Monograph
Against this background, the remainder of the monograph is struc-
tured as follows. Chapter Two (Chivvis and Davis) surveys the litera-
ture relating to security and suggests a unifying conceptual model.
Chapter Three (Taylor) surveys the literature on political issues, such
as government and governance, noting the different approaches avail-
able for both. Chapter Four (Watts) takes a somewhat different view of
political issues, noting the common dilemmas that make choices diffi-
cult; it goes on to suggest ways to deal with them. Chapter Five (Wilke,
Davis, and Chivvis) addresses a major class of social issues, establish-
ing a degree of trust and cooperation. Chapters Six and Seven deal

with economics. Chapter Six (Berrebi and Olmstead) reviews and inte-
grates the broad literature on post-conflict economics; Chapter Seven
(Berrebi and Thelen) deals specifically with the special dilemmas that
arise with respect to foreign aid. Chapter Eight (Davis) adds some final
observations, in part about lessons learned regarding policy analysis
and suggestions for future research. The monograph’s executive sum-
mary is a summary of the whole.
The monograph’s chapters overlap to some degree (as do their sub-
jects!), and even have some differences of emphasis. This is deliberate.
The intention was for the chapters to be readable individually and to
reflect some differences in perspective for an inherently complex sub-
ject matter. That said, we have sought to use consistent concepts and
terminology throughout, and to use similar methods where possible.
Endnotes
1 Part of S&R is stability operations, which include “operations to maintain or
reestablish a safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services,
construct emergency infrastructure, and offer humanitarian relief” (Flournoy,
2009).
2 The research did not address such aspects of stability operations as military capa-
bilities, doctrine, or intelligence collection. The research was also focused on the
strategic rather than the tactical aspects of post-conflict operations—that is, con-
cerned with objectives, criteria, and approaches rather than implementation.
3 The reworking of doctrine is associated with General James Petraeus (Army) and
General James Mattis (Marine Corps). The material can be found in a published
book (Department of the Army, 2007).
4 See Crane and Terrill (2003). We also benefited from a National Defense Uni-
versity briefing on the historical role of military forces in post-conflict operations
(Moore, 2010).
5 Christopher Chivvis is responsible for some of the literature review discussed in
this chapter.
6 A number of studies have described the historical experiences of Great Britain
and others, although only some of that information is publicly available (Eaton
et al., 2007).

7 We use state building and nation building interchangeably, although some
authors use the former more narrowly, to address institutional and structural issues,
but not broader economic, security, humanitarian, and other efforts included in the
latter.
8 In acronym-speak, documents refer to taking a “WOG approach that considers
all of the PMESII factors and applies all of the DIME or DIMEFIL instruments
of power.” WOG stands for “whole of government” (often interpreted even more
broadly to include, e.g., other nations’ governments, the United Nations, and non-
governmental organizations such as the United Red Cross and Physicians Without
Borders); PMESII stands for “political, military, economic, social, infrastructure,
and information”; DIME stands for “diplomatic, information, military, and eco-
nomic”; and DIMEFIL: stands for “diplomatic, information, military, economic,
financial, intelligence and law enforcement.” We shall not use these acronyms
further.
9 For example, a conceptual model for estimating the likelihood of success might
be expressed as the product of a threshold factor times a linear weighted sum of P,
M, S, and E, measures of the political, military, social, and economic components of
the problem. The threshold factor could be 0 unless each of the component measures
exceeded a threshold, but 1 otherwise. This would be in contrast to the more usual
linear form used in regression analysis, especially when data are sparse. Some recent
papers, however, do consider nonlinear forms (e.g., Collier, Hoeffler, and Rohner,
2009; Goldstone et al., 2010).
10 This issue was discussed and debated heatedly by top U.S. policymakers in the
2009 strategy review regarding Afghanistan (Woodward, 2010). The same issues
remain salient today.
11 The factor-tree methodology is described elsewhere (Davis, 2009; Davis and
Cragin, 2009). A primer is in development and will likely be published by mid 2011,
with examples from multiple applications.
12 This refers to methods pioneered by Jay Forrester at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology in the 1960s and early 1970s (Forrester, 1961, 1969, 1971). A
good modern primer is available (Sterman, 2000). Many researchers use similar
approaches that describe “system dynamics” but use different modeling methods
and languages (Morgan and Henrion, 1990; Davis, 2006). In this book, then,
“system dynamics” should be interpreted in the more general sense.
13 This type of “influence diagram” is different from that used in Bayesian analy-
sis and decision-tree methods. Ours are more akin to those of System Dynamics,
or certain kinds of cognitive, mental, or concept mapping. The U.S. Agency for
International Development’s (USAID’s) Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruc-
tion and Stabilization (S/CRS) has found the influence diagrams helpful as a tool
in interventions (personal discussions with T. Tjip Walker and Cynthia Irmer of S/
CRS, and author discussions in early 2011 as part of a USAID effort pursuing the
Introduction 17
techniques). RAND has used influence diagrams for years in various policy-analysis
applications and in adversary modeling (e.g., Davis and Jenkins, 2002).

CHAPTER TWO
Establishing Security
Christopher S. Chivvis and Paul K. Davis
Introduction
This chapter addresses the security component of stabilization and
reconstruction (S&R). If security is achieved with the nation at peace
with itself and its neighbors (even with imperfect governance), the mis-
sion will likely be regarded to have been at least partially successful (in
the short run); if the country redescends into conflict, the intervention
will almost always be judged to have been a failure. Thus, establishing
self-sustaining security can be seen both as a requirement and as the
most urgent objective in S&R. As discussed in Chapter One, the politi-
cal, social, and economic problems are intertwined, and a measure of
success is essential in all of them, but without security, progress on the
other components is very difficult.1
The chapter proceeds as follows. The next section draws on the
scholarly literature to identify issues, factors, and points of agreement
and disagreement. The literature is quite fragmented, so we then pres-
ent a conceptual model, our synthesis of how to understand “establish-
ing security” analytically. The model draws from theory and empirical
work, but reorganizes for policy-analytic purposes. Our intent was not
to choose among competing mini-theories, but to sketch a more gen-
eral structure incorporating the diverse contributions and adding miss-
ing elements. Subsequent sections discuss factors in that model one by
one. We then discuss instruments for improving security in S&R oper-
ations and linkages to the political, social, and economic challenges.
Finally, we give brief conclusions.
22 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Several considerations affected our work. First, given the mono-
graph’s subject (S&R), we focus on post conflict factors affecting
whether war reoccurs. However, some level of resistance may persist
after conflict nominally halts, and intervenors must worry about deter-
ring or coping with escalating resistance. This is a theme within our
conceptual model. We touch only lightly on root causes of initial con-
flict and the proximate causes of the original civil war. We do not
deal explicitly with cases in which one side achieved a total victory,
because that is seldom the circumstance of S&R. Further, we assume
that intervenors have chosen to support the government or emerging
government against an opposition faction or factions. We do not dis-
cuss the problem that sometimes arises of whether and how to “choose
sides.” As readers will appreciate, the government being helped may
have serious shortcomings. We briefly discuss how its behavior affects
the ability to create security, but it is for other chapters of this volume
to discuss political and social issues and the mechanisms by which
intervenors can influence governments constructively.
Overview of the Literature
As one article points out in its first line, “Over half of all civil wars
that began between 1944 and 1997 were followed by at least one if not
more episodes of civil war” (Quinn, Mason, and Gurses, 2007, p. 167).
Understanding why is obviously important. 2
Different Approaches to Theory
Researchers have taken diverse approaches in attempting to understand
the factors affecting prospects for sustained peace or its converse, the
restart of war. The diversity reflects disciplinary backgrounds, method-
ological preferences, organizational settings, and personalities. Differ-
ences even exist in how the researchers group factors. One categoriza-
tion is as follows:
1. Motivations for fighting: factors affecting the desire of faction(s)
to fight. For the opposition, these may include government
Establishing Security 23
repression or incompetence, political exclusion, and historically
based hatred. For the government, a motivation might be the
opportunity to crush the opposition or fear that the opposition
would undermine it if power-sharing occurred.
2. Means: factors affecting the ability of the opposition to mount
and conduct a war. These include recruits and sustained
resources, whether from internal or external sources.
3. Circumstances: factors affecting the propitiousness of fighting,
such as weakness or strength of the government; external and
internal support beyond the providing of resources covered
under means; and the presence or absence of international inter-
vention, including mediators and guarantors.
4. Aspects of decisionmaking: factors affecting decisions, which
depend on the above factors but also on values, perceptions,
fears, and other aspects of psychology.
This categorization borrows in part from, but inverts, one used
in an influential book about the conditions for peace in a post-conflict
environment (Walter, 2002). Walter grouped factors positively, in
terms of whether the conditions are ripe for negotiations, whether the
underlying issues are resolvable, and whether the parties can realisti-
cally make credible commitments to peace. At this point in our chapter
on security issues, it seemed more appropriate to focus on the “nega-
tives” that create security challenges.
Selected Empirical Findings
Researchers have generated a long list of discrete hypotheses, which
their authors often champion as providing primary explanations or
predictions. Disciplinary preferences stand out, with authors focusing
variously on economic, historical, power-balance, political, and other
factors. The results do not converge, and we ultimately concluded
that much of the empirical-statistical work was far more useful for
the authors having suggested factors than for any conclusions about
the quantitative significance of those factors (see also Chapter Eight). 3
Nonetheless, a few findings are more robust than others.
24 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Table 2.1 lists selected factors frequently discussed in the litera-
ture, notes the class of factor they fall in and whether they have statisti-
cal support, and mentions why—in virtually all cases—interpretation
is ambiguous (often with conflicting results). The citations shown are
to recommended entry points to the literature.4 The notation in the
second column is that a + or – indicates whether the factor in question
is hypothesized as increasing or decreasing, respectively, prospects for
continued peace in a post-conflict setting. Our summary is cryptic to
minimize digression from the main themes of the chapter.
Those doing statistical-empirical analysis have suggested a much
longer list of what we consider “other” considerations that can affect
decisions to cooperate or fight. We summarize many of these in
Table 2.2, again cryptically, along with illustrative citations to relevant
literature.
Another class of empirical findings that can be mentioned here
relates to metrics. We do not address metrics in any detail in this study,
but substantial efforts have been made to construct metrics of fragil-
ity and metrics to aid in S&R. In this chapter we can merely point to
some references.5
Specific Insights from the Counterinsurgency Literature About
Providing Security
The preceding material stems primarily from the civil-war and peace-
and-conflict literatures. The counterinsurgency (COIN) literature also
has insights specifically relevant to establishing security (Paul, Clarke,
and Grill, 2010; Connable and Libiki, 2010; Cornish, 2009; Kilkul-
len, 2009; Marston and Malkasian, 2008; Department of the Army,
2007; Gallula, 2006; Hoffman, 2006; Long, 2006; Kilcullen, 2005;
Schindler, 2004; Metz, 2003). It tends consistently to emphasize the
need for (1) good local intelligence, (2) focusing on the political dimen-
sion of the effort (including the need for a population-centric approach),
(3) close civilian-military cooperation and doctrine, and (4) training
that reflects the previous three items. Such considerations are incor-
porated into the counterinsurgency field manual (Department of the
Army, 2007). Empirical support for some of these hypotheses can be
seen in two recent studies (Paul et al., 2010; Connable and Libicki,
2010), as well as older literature.

28 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
One reason for failure in COIN is said to be excessive mecha-
nization, which makes the selective application of force very difficult
(Lyall and Wilson, 2009). The claim is that large numbers of light,
highly mobile ground forces are the most appropriate for COIN. The
claim is arguably a misstatement in that the availability of mechanized
equipment is less the villain than the concept of operations and train-
ing (in principle, mechanized units can dismount and can be no less
population-hostile than light infantry).
Most of the literature agrees on the population-centric approach,
on the grounds that the cooperation of the population is crucial to
insurgent success and that providing security for the population is the
number-one priority. This makes COIN a highly political activity, as
well as a very local activity. Much of the debate over counterinsurgency
has focused on what influences the population’s cooperation (e.g., Kil-
cullen, 2009; Long, 2006; Leites and Wolf, 1970; Sunderland, 1964).
Some argue that the deciding factors are material and include safety,
access to economic goods, and the degree of predictability that cooper-
ation can bring (Kilcullen, 2009). That said, ideological and emotional
factors are also likely to have an impact on the extent to which the
population will cooperate with military actions by rebel forces (Long,
2006). Clearly, if the population shares the same ideology and aims as
the rebel group, it will be more inclined to cooperate. Whether ideal
or material factors dominate is unclear, but it is likely that the popula-
tion will base any reasoned decisions on the marginal utility of each. If
rebel groups are unable to provide any human security, then ideological
affinities may not matter much at all.
Much less is written about the negative tactical components of
a population-centric approach. Collective punishment is typically not
an option for the United States and its NATO allies, even though
adversaries often use intimidation tactics to maintain public “sup-
port” (as with the Taliban currently). There are, however, some arti-
cles on the related “cost theory” of counterinsurgency, essentially the
theory that increasing the costs of cooperating with an insurgency is
the surest means to victory (see Long, 2006, which reviews RAND
studies during the Vietnam war). Some heterodox scholars have argued
Establishing Security 29
recently that Russia has had some success in the North Caucasus with
random bombings of Chechen villages (Lyall and Wilson, 2009).
Edelstein (2009) identifies two dilemmas that peacekeepers face
in attempting to provide security. The duration dilemma refers to the
trade-offs between effective long-term peacemaking and peackeepers
outlasting their welcome. The size of force dilemma is related: Although
larger forces may be more effective at their task, they may increase
nationalist resentment. This dilemma was also reflected in the 2009
review of strategy for Afghanistan. Secretary Gates was especially
concerned about the problems of an excessive “footprint” but was
later convinced that how the occupying forces operate and what they
accomplish are more important than the size of the footprint per se (see
Tyson, 2009).
On a related point, Berdal (2009) emphasizes that planning
must adapt to context and that providing security requires legitimacy
for both the intervening force and the government being established.
Although he presumably has in mind continuing security issues rather
than initial stabilization, Berdal argues that it is more useful to con-
ceive of “eliciting” security than imposing it.
A Unifying Conceptual Model
As the preceding overview of the literature indicates, the causes of vio-
lence in a post-conflict situation are multiple, complex, and variable.
Many factors have been studied, but in a fragmented way. In what
follows, we present a unifying conceptual model for establishing secu-
rity. It systematizes the main insights from this literature but uses a
causal representation suitable for discussion and assessment of policy
and strategy.7 This structuring is different from the categorization used
earlier in referring to the empirical literature. We begin with an over-
view of the model and its motivation. We then discuss the model’s ele-
ments in more detail, one by one, citing relevant literature.
30 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Overview
The model focuses on describing factors that determine degree of secu
rity, a characterization of the overall level of security in a particular
post-conflict system. Degree of security will be a function of time.
With future research it could presumably be defined as an index vari-
able on a scale of, say, 0 to 10, corresponding to a range from very inse-
cure to very secure, as depicted schematically in Figure 2.1. Its value
would be a function of overall levels of violence, both political and
criminal in nature. Standardization of such an index would be quite
useful for communication and analysis.
Given the status of current social science, we aspire only to iden-
tify and organize the factors determining degree of security, without
purporting to predict results. Figure 2.2 is a pictorial synthesis in the
form of a factor tree. It applies at a snapshot in time. The value of a
given factor at a specific time, however, can depend not only on subor-
dinate factors in the same branch of the tree but also on earlier values of
factors elsewhere in the tree. This is necessary because, as emphasized
in the literature (e.g., Quinn, Mason, and Gurses, 2007), developments
have “path dependence,” i.e., history matters.
Figure 2.2 depicts degree of security as resulting from two or three
primary factors, depending on whether some resistance continues even
in the nominally post-conflict environment. Those factors are the resis-
tance effort (a function of motivations and means), the security effort,
and the favorability of circumstances for establishing security. Degree
of security also depends on what we call the “requirements function,”
which is not a factor like the other elements in the figure but rather
describes how the factors interact to produce degree of security. It is

unusual to show such a function in factor-tree diagrams, but we wish
to dramatize the fact that there is much uncertainty about how big the
security effort must be.
Whether there is significant resistance is a major factor in
Figure 2.2. That depends on decisions. Figure 2.3 decribes factors
affecting the parties’ decisions on whether to restart or reescalate con-
flict, rather than cooperate. It reflects our desire to have a causal model
rather than a risk-factor model as found in the statistical-empirical
literature. Thus, whereas researchers examining data on past postwar
developments look for what they call “determinants,” such as past his-
tory, resources for conflict, ethnic divisions, and the way in which the
previous conflict stopped, we see it as more useful to highlight the role
of decisions (see also Quinn, Mason, and Gurses, 2007, p. 173; Kreutz,

2010b). The various determinants examined in the statistical-empir-
ical literature can be factors affecting the decisions, either explicitly
or implicitly. Note that Figure 2.3 includes factors favoring both the
restart of war and the commitment to peace.
If we understood and could measure degree of security, security
effort, resistance, and favorability of circumstances, we could aspire to
decision aids something like what is shown in Figure 2.4, which illus-
trates schematically how much security could be achieved as a function
of the security effort (defined here as the maximum effort achieved
after a buildup that might take many months or even years). The pos-
tulated relationship is that the security effort required grows substan-

tially with resistance level and is quite uncertain unless resistance is
minimal. This would be especially true if the index measuring degree
of security reflected antigovernment subversive elements that might
be continuing without much visible violence. Consider the size of the
internal-security apparatus routinely present, and presumably required,
in countries such as the former Soviet Union, East Germany, Iran,
or Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. These were in addition to regular security
forces, such as armies.
We also need to touch on dynamics. If we use security effort to
mean the maximum level of effort achieved after a buildup, and S(t)
to indicate the time-dependent level, then for simplicity, assume a
buildup as shown in the top portion of Figure 2.5. Initially, S(t) grows
entirely because of the deployment of foreign forces (assuming that the
country’s internal security apparatus has collapsed). Over time, local
forces begin to replace the foreign forces while maintaining the total

level of effort. The intent, of course, is that degree of security should
improve steadily until reaching some acceptable level. Progress, how-
ever, is often nonlinear: Even in good cases, progress may be in fits
and starts, and the entire effort may fail—perhaps because the security
effort was too small. The bottom portion of Figure 2.5 illustrates non-
linearity for good and bad scenarios. In the favorable scenario, security
becomes “self-sustaining” after about 40 time periods. Thereafter (not
shown), it might be sustained with a decreasing effort. In the unfavor-
able case, the initial effort is promising, but the later effort fails.
Let us now discuss the elements separately: the security effort,
resistance effort, favorability of circumstances, and the requirements
function. Except that we treat the security effort first, discussion will
follow the factor-tree depiction of Figure 2.2 from left to right.
Security Effort
As its name suggests, security effort is a measure of the total effort
going into creating security. We have in mind the maximum level of
effort over time, as in the top portion of Figure 2.5. It reflects the
capability and capacity of all security organizations in the system, for-
eign and local, military and law enforcement. It incorporates quali-
tative as well as quantitative dimensions. The effective level of effort,
after all, depends not just on the number of personnel involved but
also on their quality, the strategy and tactics used, the coherence of
efforts (e.g., across foreign and local forces), and their sustainability.
The scale of the security effort might be large, but effectiveness low
because of poor training, command incompetence, and other factors.
As illustrated in the top portion of Figure 2.5, the standard expecta-
tion would be that local forces increasingly substitute for foreign forces
and then take over. One result of successful stabilization, then, will be
a state capable of securing itself with minimal or no external assistance.
Success should also mean declining violence and declining levels of
effort required for the same degree of security. How long achieving this
success takes depends in part on how rapidly domestic forces can be
recruited, equipped, and trained. That, in turn, depends on political,
economic, and social developments discussed in other chapters of this
volume.
36 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Measuring Security Effort. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to
define security effort more precisely, but we suggest an approach akin to
that used successfully for many years in approximating force balances. 8
The basic unit of measure might be something akin to “equivalent bri-
gades.” A standard U.S. Army brigade suitable for a given type of post-
conflict operation might be given a score of 1, and all other units being
used in stability operations would be scored on a relative basis. A unit
might have a lower score, due to its being, for example, small, poorly
equipped, or being poorly trained and commanded (often the case for
local forces, as in Afghanistan). The overall score of the security effort
might be enhanced by multipliers reflecting, e.g., air supremacy, rou-
tine armed surveillance, and command and control. It might be dis-
counted by multipliers reflecting combined-arms imbalances, such as
inadequate mobility, the complete absence of armor, or a severe short-
age of infantry (Allen, 1992). The effectiveness of such a force would
depend on circumstances and the requirements function, as discussed
below. Although this approach may seem complicated and subjective,
experience indicates that it can be far simpler (and even more credible
to military “operators” and force planners, if not to simulation model-
ers) than methods that are more data-intensive or based more on com-
puter models. This approach does not, however, substitute for more
in-depth analysis, such as those conducted by operations planners.
Resistance Effort
Assuming conflict (we discuss the decision about that below), under-
standing the resistance effort (left branch of Figure 2.2) is even more
challenging than understanding the security effort. The resistance
effort would also depend on scale (e.g., number of people involved in
insurgency or other subversive activities), quality, strategy and tactics,
coherence, and sustainability. However, because resistance can take
many forms and be either potential or actual, measuring it will require
research to define new methods. We speculate that it may be most
useful to characterize the resistance effort with an index variable of the
sort commonly used by social scientists, perhaps on a scale of 0 to 10
with 10 being very high resistance (Figure 2.6), to attach a magnitude
as well, and to use terms such as low, moderate, and high as shorthand
Establishing Security 37
in depictions such as in Figure 2.4. The effectiveness of the opposition’s
resistance effort will depend on the security effort, the circumstances,
and the requirements function, as discussed below.
One reason for an index scale would be to recognize that actors
have more than the binary choice of deciding whether to fight or coop-
erate. As in Figure 2.6, they have a spectrum of possibilities, rang-
ing from cooperation and disarmament through conflict via proxies to
direct violent confrontation. The overt level of resistance will change
as the political, military, and economic situations ebb and flow. This is
a familiar phenomenon in the continuing struggle between Israel and
Palestinians.
As mentioned above, there is both a potential for violent resis-
tance and a realization of violence. An opposition faction may decide
to cooperate temporarily while retaining the capability to take resis-
tance actions later if necessary, and perhaps making plans for subse-
quent insurgency. Or it may effectively decide to allow its capabilities
to wane. What we are calling resistance effort, then, is probably a func-
tion of both exhibited violence and the level of other subversive activi-
ties. Again, refining this concept is a subject for future research, but the
need is evident from history and other aspects of the research literature.
Favorability of Circumstances
A major factor determining what degree of security can be achieved is
the favorability of circumstances for the security effort (third branch

of Figure 2.2). That depends on different types of subordinate fac-
tors. Some are physical (e.g., whether the opposition has mountains,
forests, or otherwise remote and difficult-to-access areas in which to
hide; whether the country’s infrastructure makes government access
more or less difficult; and whether safe havens exist, as in a neighbor-
ing country).
Other factors are political, economic, and social. Perhaps the big-
gest is whether the opposition enjoys a significant degree of popular
support, which can drastically affect the opposition’s ability to oper-
ate (i.e., do locals report their presence to authorities or do they allow
them to use their homes for safety, help them obtain intelligence, and
facilitate their obtaining necessary material?). This will depend on such
matters as whether the governance system is competent and providing
services, or the opposite. The effectiveness of the resistance effort will
also depend in some instances on international support, which might
involve intelligence, special weapons, military advisors, international
criticisms of government security efforts (whether or not justified), and
sanctuary.
Underlying some of these factors are various aspects of history.
Every conflict has a unique history that shapes the post-conflict envi-
ronment. Sometimes factors from the prewar era will have a signifi-
cant impact on stabilization. More often than not, war changes societ-
ies, and the history most important to the post-conflict environment
will be the immediate experience of the war. Bosnia is a case in point.
Before the war, Bosnia’s ethnic groups were intermixed and highly tol-
erant (much more so than was often reported in the early years of the
Bosnian difficulties). After the war, ethnic relations were polarized on a
geographical, political, social, and emotional level. The failure to recog-
nize the full impact of the war hampered postwar stabilization efforts
(Woodward, 1999; Ramet, 2005; Chivvis, 2010).
Some starting points will be more propitious than others. Start-
ing points where indigenous security forces are well on their way to
providing security for the population, or where the population is pre-
pared to acquiesce to the new post-conflict reality, will obviously be
easiest. Starting points where the foreign forces are required to provide
most or all of the security from the start and where there are groups of
Establishing Security 39
the population that are not prepared to acquiesce to the post-conflict
arrangement (e.g., Iraq for several years after the 2003 invasion) will be
the most challenging.
Some factors, such as geography and topography, will ordinarily
remain stable. Others may change due to “exogenous” developments,
such as the policies and stability of neighboring states or the moral and
political support in foreign capitals for S&R activities. Still other fac-
tors will change “endogenously” as the result of, e.g., economic growth
and political maturation.
The Decision to Seek Peace or Reinitiate Conflict
As discussed above, a key issue is the decision about whether to restart
(or escalate) conflict rather than cooperate.9 Figure 2.3 describes the
decision as the result of three kinds of factors. The left and right
branches correspond to a kind of rational-choice model in which the
factions address the pros and cons of either resisting to various degrees
(restarting conflict) or cooperating in stabilization. The central branch
adds recognition that human decisions are not, in fact, well described
by rational-analytic models. Nor are decisions based exclusively on the
so-called expected values of options as assumed in much of the S&R-
relevant literature. Instead, people think about upside potential (“it is
at least possible that we could achieve a glorious victory”) and about
downside risks (“but if we lose next time, it could mean our annihi-
lation”). Since people do not get to relive their lives many times, it is
understandable that they do not necessarily make decisions based on
the expected value.
Beyond-Rational Considerations. A number of phenomena
undercut rationality, whether by individuals or groups:
Perceptions. Even when attempting rational decisions by exam-
ining pros and cons, perceptions of reality can be quite wrong—
especially in post-conflict societies, where fears are intense and easily
manipulated.
Information. In many instances, the pros and cons cannot be
evaluated for simple lack of information (What is the adversary think-
ing? Is he planning treachery? How big is his army, really?). The lack of
information or ability to process was at the heart of what is called, in
40 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
economics and other social sciences, bounded rationality (the basis for
a Nobel Prize by Herbert Simon; for his speech reviewing the matter,
see Simon, 1992).
Cognitive Biases. According to the accumulated research of psy-
chologists over decades, it is unnatural and difficult for people to make
entirely rational risk-benefit calculations. Most relevant, perhaps, is that
people often have a decided bias toward avoiding options that involve
losses (even if, in doing so, they run risks of much bigger losses). This
phenomenon is discussed under the rubric of prospect theory (which
resulted in a Nobel Prize for Daniel Kahneman; for his acceptance
speech, see Kahneman, 2002) and has been explored quite recently
in the context of recurrence of war in post-conflict situations (Kreutz,
2010b). There are benefits to some of the cognitive biases, which proba-
bly explains why they are wired into our minds. In many instances, more
intuitive or “naturalistic” decisionmaking is superior to what happens
when people attempt to do rational-analytic decisionmaking without
sufficient information or imagination. The styles of decisionmaking are
reviewed and compared in Davis, Kulick, and Egner (2005).
One aspect of the cognitive bias issue is that when people bal-
ance an option’s likely outcomes, best-case outcomes (upside potential),
and downside risks, they often tend—depending on their situation—
to be “unreasonably” risk-avoidant or “unreasonably” risk-taking. This
has been examined in connection with deterrence in counterterrorism
and counterinsurgency and crisis decisionmaking, among other places
(Davis, 1994; National Academy of Sciences, 1996; Davis, 2010).
Other Factors. The economic and structural factors emphasized
by some researchers (e.g., Collier, Hoeffler, and Rohner, 2009) can
be seen as natural contributors to the rational-analytic portions of
the model. Some of the factors emphasized by others (e.g., Sambanis,
2004, 2005; Goldstone et al., 2010; Quinn, Mason, and Gurnes, 2007;
Kreutz, 2010a, 2010b) arguably manifest themselves at least in part
through the beyond-rational factors, as do behavioral factors discussed
extensively in the Vietnam war social-science literature (Long, 2006).10
Our conceptual model of the decision rejects the temptation
to choose one of the rival “theories” of the literature (e.g., those that
focus on greed, grievance, motivation, or feasibility rather than politi-
Establishing Security 41
cal factors, or vice versa). The intent is to move toward a comprehen-
sive theory within which one can discuss all considerations and—for
a given context—narrow down. For example, in a given country at a
given time and circumstance, the economic factors and a rational-actor
model might drive decisions on resistance (assuming account is taken
of misperceptions, uncertainty, and the like). In other cases and times,
the beyond-rational factors would dominate.
The Requirements Function
The rightmost part of the factor tree in Figure 2.2 shows the require-
ments function. This is not a factor in the usual sense, but rather the
function that dictates what degree of security is achieved for a given
resistance effort, security effort, and set of circumstances. In combat
modeling, a simplistic requirements function for an attacker has often
been said to be as follows: If the defender has well-prepared defenses in
favorable terrain, then if the attacker has a force ratio much higher than
3:1, the attacker will prevail; if the force ratio is significantly smaller
than 3:1, the defense will prevail; and if the force ratio is around 3:1,
results are highly uncertain. For establishing security, a historically
derived rule of thumb has been that the ratio of “boots on the ground”
to population must be at least 1:40 for a significant counterinsurgency
(Quinlivan, 1995–1996)—implying the need for far more than the
troop levels in Afghanistan currently. It can be argued that this rule
does not apply if the stabilization force has air supremacy, reconnais-
sance strike capability, extensive use of special operations forces, and
world-class command and control. Perhaps such advantages will buy a
factor of two or more in effectiveness. Others shake their heads skepti-
cally, noting that technology-oriented people often claim great results
from their innovations, but that history has not been kind on the
matter: Having many boots on the ground is essential. Truth on this
and related matters is yet to be determined.
A better requirements function would probably depend on a much
more fine-grained approach. After all, not all of a country needs to be
stabilized at the same time, some regions pose less difficulty than others
because of terrain and local sentiments, and the actual troop require-
ments depend on the missions to be performed—all of which suggest
42 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
use of tools translating missions to tasks and force requirements, which
depend on military doctrine rather than the more coarse-grained
social-science literature.11 Whether such refinements would change the
conclusions, and whether doctrine-based calculations can keep up with
changes in technology and tactics, is unclear. Our bottom line here is
that even if one understands the security effort, resistance effort, and
circumstances, there are big uncertainties in requirements.
The Security Dilemma
The preceding section dealt largely with how a decision to cooperate
or fight might be made. It focused on high-level concepts, such as risk.
To fully understand the issues, however, a much deeper look is needed,
and social science has a good deal to offer.
An appropriate starting point for discussion is a particularly
well-studied element of political science called the security dilemma,
depicted simply in Figure 2.7 as though there are only two actors,
such as the government and the main opposition faction. The security
dilemma strongly affects perceptions, fear, and behavior.
The security dilemma describes the perspective of an actor (a
person, group, or state) who, facing an inherently insecure environ-
ment, seeks to increase its own security but, in doing so, decreases the
perceived security of other actors in the system; the actor thereby inad-
vertently decreases both its own security and the system’s overall level

Establishing Security 43
of security (Jervis, 1978; Posen, 1993; Walter and Snyder, 1999; Rose,
2000; Walter, 2002; Byman, 2002). The vicious circle of the security
dilemma is active in both wartime and post-conflict situations. It can
apply between rival opposition factions and between such a faction and
the government. It exists at the level of large groups and at the indi-
vidual level. Individuals, for example, might purchase small arms and
form groups for self-protection, but this will threaten former adversar-
ies who will do likewise, leading to increased tensions and pressures
to break the peace preemptively. Increasing the degree of post-conflict
security requires reversing this vicious circle (Walters, 2002).
One implication is that where credible commitments to the peace
are lacking, one of the main roles of international forces is to pro-
vide that credibility and thus reduce fears and facilitate cooperation.
Increasing the strength of a state’s military, however, can increase the
security dilemma’s intensity if rebels are not included in the govern-
ment and thus have reason to fear the government will renege on its
peace promises (Collier and Hoeffler, 2006; 2007). Such issues are dis-
cussed further in later chapters.
The ferocity of the vicious cycle may reflect psychological, ide-
ational, and cultural matters, as well as reality. Weapon technology
that is offensive in nature can also increase fear, as do certain political
geographies that create incentives for pre-emptive strikes (Posen, 1993;
Rose, 2000). If the past war was irregular or involved atrocities, histori-
cal baggage can be expected to exacerbate fear and distrust (Kalyvas,
2006). This is one reason that the trust-building measures discussed in
Chapter Four can have such an important impact.
The security dilemma need not be acute at the outset of an epi-
sode, but it may develop subsequently (e.g., the security dilemma was
hardly acute among Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish factions in Iraq before
the 2003 invasion, when Saddam was firmly in control, but became a
reality subsequently).
Still another phenomenon can be understood in security-
dilemma terms. Common crime, even of a serious nature, should be
distinguished analytically from politically motivated violence, granted
that the two can overlap in some situations. Nevertheless, “petty”
and random violence can still increase fear. The need for protection
44 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
from random violence can increase the tendency to gather small arms
and take other measures that inherently, if unintentionally, increase
offensive capabilities of one group over another. Moreover, common
crime can have broader implications if it is interpreted through a
meta-narrative of ethnic violence. For example, if random local vio-
lence results in the death of an individual from one ethnic group at the
hands of another, even if the violence was criminal or personal and not
political in nature, the crime can easily take on political meaning and
thereby tend to undermine security (Kalyvas, 2006). Random violence
of a local or criminal nature, therefore, even if not linked to political
aims, can still increase the overall demand for security by intensify-
ing fears and hence the security dilemma. This is why effective police
forces and rule of law have positive impacts on security far beyond their
ability to eliminate insurgents.
To overcome the security dilemma, people’s behavior and expec-
tations must change. Trust between former and potential future adver-
saries must grow. This is why such acts as public displays of disar-
mament are important and also why inflammatory rhetoric, even if
otherwise innocuous, can be dangerous. Notably, where adversarial
groups are not unified internally and leaders are forced to struggle for
power within their own groups, the tendency toward inflammatory
rhetoric increases, as was the case in Bosnia, where nationalist lead-
ers were often pushed to maximalist positions in order to gain power
within their own groups, and in the process efforts to build trust
between ethnic groups were hampered.
Time is also likely to be a factor. On the simplest level, one of the
main forces intensifying fear will be the memory of the war. As that
memory fades, so will the intensity of the security dilemma. Conscious
efforts on the part of group leaders to keep the memory of the war alive
will, of course, work against this effect. Building trust takes time and
repeated interactions to rebuild social capital destroyed by the war. The
longer security lasts, the more fears can be expected to diminish.
To summarize some primary points here:
• People arm themselves and prepare to fight because they fear
the state, other groups, or both. The security dilemma, then, is
multisided.
Establishing Security 45
• The state must be strong enough to prevent groups from being
harmed by other states, but its own actions and structure must be
sufficiently restrained, and the state must be sufficiently account-
able, so that groups do not fear being targeted or excluded by the
state (see also Wiatrowski and Goldstone, 2010).
• Security forces that are dominated by one ethnic group, or that
are themselves corrupt and dangerous to civilians, worsen the
dilemma and reinforce resistance rather than stabilization.
The implications of these issues include the need to create inclu-
sive and accountable governance and to pursue trust-building among
others. Such issues are discussed in other chapters of this volume, par-
ticularly Chapters Three and Five.
Improving the Security Effort
Security Forces
Let us now return to the security effort itself, and discuss briefly some
of the ways in which it can be improved, focusing on points not made
earlier.
Foreign Forces. We assume that in most S&R operations initial
security will be provided in part or fully by foreign forces, with local
forces replacing them over time (Figure 2.5). The level of foreign troops
needed is a complex issue, as discussed earlier, but several points are
important:
• Ideally, the character of foreign forces should be quite different
from those optimized for mechanized warfare (Binnendijk and
Johnson, 2004).
• When the foreign forces come from multiple countries, success-
ful stabilization operations may depend significantly on the con-
gruence of the interests in the international community (Pei and
Kasper, 2003).
• Their perceived legitimacy is crucial and will depend on the coun-
try’s history, the identity of the foreign forces, and their profes-
sionalism and training (including cultural training). In the past,
46 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
UN forces, although often less capable, have enjoyed greater legit-
imacy than coalitions of western forces.
• The acceptance of foreign forces wanes over time, making it even
more important that handover is seen to be occurring, and does.
Building Local Forces. Building local security forces is a well-
known challenge with details beyond the scope of this chapter. Some
key points relating to security force assistance (SFA), security sector
reform (SSR), and other processes are as follows:
• Developing local professional military forces can be an important
part of the S&R process, since military service to the nation is an
age-old form of building consensus across groups (Krebs, 2004).
• More security forces, however, may either improve or worsen
stability, depending on details. Professionalism and coherence
matter.
• As discussed above in connection with the security dilemma,
security forces dominated by one faction (e.g., a particular ethnic
group) can exacerbate insecurities and raise resistance.
The starting point will vary across countries. Often, it will be
poor because civil wars tend to occur in underdeveloped countries with
poor, incohesive, factionalized militaries. Security forces may have a
deservedly bad reputation and no legitimacy. Other societies have a
long tradition of professional militaries, in which case rebuilding
domestic capacity is easier.
Linkages to Political, Social, and Economic Issues
The degree of security will be intimately intertwined with processes
taking place in the political, social, and economic spheres. The interac-
tions can be mutually reinforcing, but can also conflict (Dobbins et al.,
2007; Brinkerhoff, 2005; Doyle and Sambanis, 2006). The political,
social, and economic components of S&R are discussed in other chap-
ters of this volume, but some particular issues linked to security are
worth noting here.
Establishing Security 47
Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reconstruction (DDR). DDR
is often an important part of S&R affecting degree of security. Get-
ting DDR right can reduce security requirements and also have direct
benefits for recovery and the pace with which the state can have self-
sustaining security and stability (Colletta and Muggha, 2009). The
pace and quality of DDR, however, depend on available resources, the
state of the local economy, and characteristics of the individual com-
batants. Disarmament of soldiers can generate economic growth if the
process diverts national resources from production of military goods
toward production of nonmilitary goods and services. The effect will
be diminished if labor is abundant, as is the case in many countries
where S&R operations are apt to take place. Also, if the economy is
stagnant or the combatants are excluded from employment, reintegra-
tion is liable to falter and the possibilities of insurgency or renewed
insurgency will increase.
Some scholars (e.g., Humphreys and Weinstein, 2007) are skep-
tical about the returns on investment in DDR to date, but lackluster
results do not necessarily imply that DDR is worthless, but rather that
it could be done better. The same authors find that, as expected, past
participation in abusive military factions creates difficulties for com-
batant reintegration, and that wealthier, better educated, and younger
combatants tend to be more difficult to reintegrate.
Fiscal and Economic Resources. Economic conditions affect not
only the feasibility of fighting but also the state’s ability to pay for secu-
rity in peacetime. Poor countries find it difficult to generate the income
necessary to pay military and other security services well enough to
attract talented recruits and supply them with the training and equip-
ment needed to carry out their basic functions professionally. This can
also affect side-taking. In Afghanistan, for example, there was a period
in which the Taliban paid better than did the Afghan National Army.
In the immediate post-conflict period, much of the funding for secu-
rity forces may come from the international donor community, but
only sustained economic growth will generate the tax revenue needed
for the state to afford the security it needs over the long run.
Political and Social Context. Establishing effective local security
forces that overcome the security dilemma and generate self-sustaining
48 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
peace is not merely a technical matter of training and resources. It
also depends on esprit de corps and dedication to service to the nation,
however defined in the imagination of the people (Rubin, 2008). This
requires not only a certain state legitimacy but also military and politi-
cal leaders capable of drawing on their legitimacy to inspire service and
loyalty to military institutions. Lacking this, the pace at which security
forces are built is apt to fall.
The ability of a state’s institutions to pass necessary reform leg-
islation and to achieve effective civilian control will also depend on
its unity. If the state lacks executive authority, building high-quality,
professionalized security forces will be difficult. Unfortunately, divided
authority is a common feature of the political landscape in post-conflict
situations. The arrangements that exist may have the benefit of increas-
ing the chances that peace will hold but the disadvantage of reducing
the government’s ability to govern effectively and support its own secu-
rity forces. The Dayton Peace Accords that ended Bosnia’s civil war are
a case in point: The compromises inherent in them have made post-war
politics and reform in Bosnia extremely onerous.
The very process of security-sector reform will also be influenced
by the politics of the peace process. In a post-conflict situation, access to
military resources is a crucial object of political action. In a fragmented
post-war situation with various political forces, actors may seek control
over parts of the armed services to ensure their physical security, bol-
ster their political strength, and, in some cases, increase their ability to
extract rents (usually illegally) from the land. All of this works against
desirable versions of security-sector reform (Rubin, 2008).
Some Important Dynamics. We have noted repeatedly the inter-
connections among S&R components, shown in Figure 1.2 of Chap-
ter One. Both the complicated influences and the ambiguity of effects
need to be reflected in serious thinking about security in an S&R con-
text. Perhaps the most important points are these:
• Because of the security-dilemma issues, increased security effort
may either improve or worsen stability. How the internal security
effort is approached is crucial.
Establishing Security 49
• Developing security forces is inherently political and social, and
is strongly linked to political legitimacy (Papagianni, 2008,
pp. 49–71; Kratochwil, 2006; Lipset, 1959), which is further dis-
cussed in Chapters Three, Six, and Seven.
Conclusions: Security and Self-Sustaining Peace
If security is to become self-sustaining, both the propensity for violence
and the degree of fear (often fear of the state’s security forces) must
decline to a point at which people no longer arm or otherwise prepare
themselves excessively for fighting—allowing the state to have more or
less a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence, as defined in the clas-
sic work of Max Weber (1946). A virtuous cycle may ensue.
At any time, however, events can impede or reverse this virtu-
ous cycle—developments in any or all of the security, political, social,
or economic components. Thus, even though establishing security is
widely accepted as primary in the hierarchy of needs in post-conflict
stabilization, it does not follow that higher degrees of security are in
themselves sufficient for post-conflict S&R. Understanding the inter-
relationships (in Figure 1.2) is a core challenge for S&R.
Endnotes
1 Many references exist on this, but see, e.g., Dobbins et al., 2007; Caplan, 2005;
Rotberg, 2004; Schwartz, 2005; and Chesterman, 2004.
2 The literature on post-conflict stability is relatively small, so we also drew on
literatures dealing with nation-building, fragile states, counterinsurgency (COIN),
and civil wars. The civil-war literature tends to be concerned with causes of violence.
The COIN literature deals more with lessons learned and the effectiveness of dif-
ferent strategies for fighting insurgencies. The methods used by researchers include
statistical regression, game theory, theoretical economics, econometrics, and his-
torical case studies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. As should be
expected for a field at this stage of development, much of the literature entangles
theory building and theory testing.

neous historical data from different conflicts in different parts of the world and dif-
50 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
ferent contexts. The resulting analysis suffers from hidden-variable problems, endo-
geneity, and weaknesses in the underlying, mostly linear models used. The work has
been interesting and productive, but, as a prominent contributor noted in a review
of an earlier draft of this manuscript, “The problem is that the more careful social
scientists are about making causal arguments, the less they have to say about the
very complex questions that this manuscript addresses.” See also Chapter Eight.
4 The literature is large. Pioneering work on economic factors in civil wars began
only in the last decade (Collier and Hoeffler, 2000, 2004; Fearon and Laitin, 2003;
Humphreys 2005; Lujala et al., 2005). It helped dispel the impression that post–
Cold War outbreaks of violence in Africa, the Balkans, Latin America, and else-
where were wholly irrational and incomprehensible to the “civilized” western world.
Originally cast in terms of whether greed or grievance dominated motivations, later
work emphasizes feasibility:
The feasibility hypothesis proposes that where rebellion is feasible it will occur:
motivation is indeterminate, being supplied by whatever agenda happens to
be adopted by the first social entrepreneur to occupy the viable niche, or itself
endogenous to the opportunities thereby opened for illegal income. (Collier,
Hoeffler, and Rohner, 2009)
Political factors were often given short shrift in the early work, but recent work by
prominent authors, while not disputing that economic factors play a role, concludes
that regime type has been the strongest statistical indicator of whether civil war will
occur (Goldstone et al., 2010). The authors note (p. 205):
We view the model as, not as one of instability, but rather one of resilience. If
the factors associated with stability are in place—high income, low discrimina-
tion, few conflicts in the neighborhood, and most important, a noncontested
or unified political regime—the model suggests that the polity will remain
stable.
5 The Governance and Social Development Resource Centre (GSDRC) of the
United Kingdom and Australia has a website with numerous materials relating to
state fragility (GSDRC, 2006). See also Agoglia, Dziedzic, and Sotirin (2011) for a
compendium on measuring progress in conflict environments.
6 It is easy to believe that many wars are driven by ethnic hatreds, but evidence
is limited (Fearon and Laitin, 1996; Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Collier and Hoef-
fler, 2004). Recent articles argue that a correlation does exist if proper measures of
ethnic factionalism are used (Cederman and Girardin, 2007; Montalvo and Reynal-
Querol, 2005). Ultimately, it seems that ethnicity plays a role primarily because it
defines a ready-made social network for the formation of subnational groups (Este-
ban and Ray, 2008; Habyarimana et al., 2007; Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005)—
something easily exploited by leaders seeking to create resonant themes around
which to gather supporters. That said, after a struggle is organized around ethnicity,
Establishing Security 51
ethnic tension may be so high as to be a risk factor in itself (see also Gurr, 2000;
Horowitz, 1985).
The case of the Balkans illustrates the issues. In the early 1990s, some argued
that continued conflict was inevitable because of ancient ethnic hatreds (Kaplan,
1993), an argument contributing to the reluctance of European and U.S. leaders to
intervene. Other observers insisted that Bosnia’s ethnic groups had lived peacefully
together for decades and even intermarried (Malcolm, 1994; Posen, 1993). They
argued that the real force behind the violence was the aggressive power-building of
Milosevic and other nationalist leaders, who used ethnic rhetoric to divide Yugosla-
via along ethnic lines. Still others pointed to how criminal activities were furthered
by ethnic politics (Mueller, 2000).
7 A “causal representation” shows factors causing effects. It does not, however,
imply the ability to predict results with any confidence. In the S&R domain, pre-
diction is difficult because of uncertainties in the factors’ values, the functions that
connect them, and complex dynamics over time. Factor trees and influence dia-
grams, however, can still be very useful, e.g., in suggesting how to influence events
positively or negatively.
8 The older methods used terms such as armored division equivalents (Kugler,
2006), WEI WUV scoring (Mako, 1983), and situational scoring (Allen, 1992, 1995).
Despite inherent mathematical limitations and criticisms, the methods proved valu-
able over decades, especially when situationally adjusted for terrain and combined-
arms mix (Allen, 1992), as in the RAND Strategy Assessment System. These older
methods were used in war games, higher-level campaign analyses, balance assess-
ments, and other applications within the United States and NATO, and they were
sometimes more insightful than results from big-model exercises. For such methods
to work well, however, a good deal of class knowledge is needed, along with struc-
tured methods for estimating scores that draw on both experienced military officers
and analysts, as well as history (Dupuy, 1987).
9 Significantly, conflict may be started not by one of the previous antagonists, but
by a spin-off faction that will not accept the peace to which the original faction had
agreed (Kreutz, 2010a, 2010b).
10 As one example, rebellion against tyranny often has emotional components not
captured by a stable utility function. Although rational-analytic methods could be
used to infer a “revealed” utility function, such utility functions are not stable over
time (e.g., between periods of revolutionary zeal and periods of physical and moral
exhaustion) and are therefore dubious concepts.
11 One such computerized tool, the Stability Operations Army Force Estimator
(SAFE), was developed by colleague Tom Szayna and collaborators for the U.S.
Army. It draws directly on Army doctrine. Only a short description exists in the
open literature (Army Science Board, 2006).

CHAPTER THREE
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions
Julie E. Taylor
Creating Governing Institutions That Maintain Peace and
Stability
General Observations
An important objective of stabilization and reconstruction (S&R) is
to support the formation of an effective government that is responsive
to the concerns of its citizens. Generically, a government is a system of
social control for establishing and enforcing laws. A country’s govern-
ment usually has national, regional, and local layers. Huge variations
exist across countries with regard to what functions are performed by
which layer(s) of government. Governments also vary in terms of their
structure, character, and basis of legitimacy. And, of course, they vary
in their competence. Modern country-level governments (national gov-
ernments) are typically expected to provide security from both external
and internal threats to the nation and to provide national-level order, a
system of national-level justice, and mechanisms to promote commerce
(e.g., physical infrastructure, a currency, and relevant laws). They may
or may not have a strong role in related functions at the regional and
local levels. They may also have important roles in providing or con-
tributing to social welfare, education, health, and even religion.
Any intervening authority, in seeking to affect such functioning
of governance, is likely to be affected and even constrained by its own
history and values, as well as by international standards, such as the
UN Charter on Human Rights. This said, while military interven-
tions are sometimes launched with lofty goals, their concern is peace,
rather than social justice. That is, the top priority is to “leave a country
66 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
at peace with itself and its neighbors” (Dobbins et al., 2007, p. xxxiv).
That said, major issues remain about the form and shape of govern-
ments, how quickly proximate and higher-order goals can be achieved,
what should happen when progress on one set of goals (be they objec-
tives concerning rights, development, or security) impedes progress on
another set of goals, and so on. These issues often loom large in post-
conflict nation-building. This chapter surveys scholarly thinking on
major, continuing issues, and points out matters of agreement, matters
of disagreement, and dilemmas.
Distinguishing What Is Optimal from What Is Feasible
There is a tendency for intervening countries to try and remake host
nations in their own image. Having been well served by the laws and
institutions underpinning their own political and economic systems,
intervening powers may assume that transplanting those institutions
will likewise provide others with “that which they hold dear—domestic
peace, the blessing of democratic politics, and the rich fruits of devel-
oped economies” (Etzioni, 2004, p. 1). Given that laws and institutions
often evolve from a nation’s normative values, intervening countries
may not only perceive them to be the most beneficial choices, but also
the most ethical. For example, the United States, because of its tradi-
tions, values, and experience, tends to go into post-conflict situations
with the assumption that the national-level government should be rela-
tively strong and cohesive, as well as at least reasonably democratic in
terms of owing its legitimacy to the consent of the governed, promot-
ing human rights (including protections of women and minorities),
and holding officials accountable though electoral competition. These
assumptions motivated much of the U.S. agenda in post-invasion Iraq
and Afghanistan, but setbacks have caused the United States and its
coalition partners to take a much closer look at the viability of their
post-conflict aspirations.
There is now a movement afoot to scale back missions from what
is optimal, in the eyes of the intervening party, to what is feasible
given the limitations of a post-war environment (Etzioni, 2004, p. 1).
In a looking-back-for-lessons essay, George McCall emphasizes that
the implicit assumptions made by Americans in post-conflict nation-
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 67
building are often seriously mismatched with reality, even to the extent
of misunderstanding the direction of causality (McCall, 2009). For
example, although most democracies have strong civil societies, increas-
ing “social capital” may not improve democracy at all (McCall, 2009),
and as Amaney Jamal points out in her study of Palestinian political
parties, in a fragile and violent environment, civil society can be used
to support authoritarian tendencies as well (Jamal, 2007). Accord-
ing to another study, the rich associational life in Germany’s Weimar
Republic helped the Nazis capture public support, thus contributing
to their rapid rise to power (Berman, 1997). Investing in civil society
sounds good on paper, but like many intuitive prescriptions for post-
conflict states, the benefits may be realized only after a certain level
of government control, institutionalization, or development has been
achieved. Since these are the factors that post-conflict countries typi-
cally lack, well-intended policies can result in unintended or deleteri-
ous consequences.
In keeping with the push to limit the aims of S&R, there are
also calls to proceed cautiously with policies that, though they might
improve a population’s general welfare in the long term, risk provok-
ing hostilities during implementation. Support for girls’ education in
Afghanistan is one such example. Education, it was thought, would not
only improve conditions for Afghan women who had suffered under
the Taliban but would also benefit all of Afghan society: Numerous
studies have shown that women’s education levels are associated with
economic growth, democracy, lower levels of intrastate conflict, and
better health (Aslam, 2010, p. 2; Fish, 2002, p. 5; Melander, 2005,
p. 695).1
Yet, despite considerable efforts and expenditures by the interna-
tional community, improving girls’ education in regions beyond Kabul
has proven difficult. Many traditional Afghans consider it a stain on
their honor to have female family members seen by men who are not
immediate relatives. Most of the new girls’ schools cannot accommo-
date traditional standards of modesty: Many are housed in tents that
are open to outside viewing and, due to the dearth of qualified teach-
ers, are staffed, at least partially, by male instructors and administra-
tors. The Taliban have used the schools’ challenge to traditional gender
68 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
roles as the basis for attacks against teachers and students. The vio-
lence underscores the government’s failure to protect its citizens, fur-
ther eroding its popular support. If the Taliban are able to successfully
exploit the issue of girls’ education, and they are ultimately returned
to power, then rather than liberating women from their inferior social
status, girls’ schools may be partially responsible for returning them to
the confines of their homes and stripping them of their rights. Fearing
such unintended consequences, planners are rethinking the efficacy
of leading nation-building efforts with such culturally transformative
policies and are emphasizing the need for policies to have strong local
support (as has been the case in the well-known, but recently contro-
versial school-building of Greg Mortenson, many for girls [Mortenson
and Relin, 2006]). Recalibrating the strategy does not mean abandon-
ing well-intended, long-term goals or violating U.S. sensibilities; rather,
it involves adapting expectations and timelines to what can realisti-
cally be achieved (Ottoway, 2003, p. 316). Alternative strategies might
include (1) greater investment in teacher training to ensure that before
girls’ education is introduced in rural areas, female teachers are avail-
able; (2) building school facilities that can accommodate the modesty
requirements of Pardah; and (3) enhancing the value of girls’ education
by developing local female employment opportunities that are clearly
linked to educational achievement. These approaches would slow the
creation of educational opportunities for girls and women, but those
opportunities created would likely be more sustainable.
Dilemma. Extending this particular discussion, the subject of
women’s rights poses a major dilemma for the United States and its
UN partners in Afghanistan and elsewhere. As of summer 2010, Presi-
dent Hamid Karzai continues to favor reconciliation with the Taliban.
Such a compromise might be welcome for providing peace if it included
not supporting al Qaeda operations. Yet, as a condition for their par-
ticipation in a coalition government, Taliban leaders would surely
demand the reimposition of their strict interpretation of Islamic Law.
How could Western leaders agree to a settlement that continued abject
subjugation of women? Would reintegration—an alternative “compro-
mise” strategy that aims to isolate Taliban leaders while reaching out to
low- and mid-level fighters—likewise risk a precipitous reversal in the
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 69
fortunes of Afghan women, or would the impact be less severe? In the
shadow of the impending drawdown, a public debate about the impact
of withdrawal rages on. Some critics argue that the status of women
should not be used as a justification for a continued U.S. occupation—
something they perceive to be a greater violation of Afghan liberty and
a cause of continued conflict and suffering (Gopal, 2010; Nordland,
2010; Rothkopf, 2010). Others acknowledge that improving the treat-
ment of Afghan women and girls will be difficult but believe that doing
so is a matter of universal human rights, and that universal rights are
rendered meaningless if applied selectively (Hudson and Leidel, 2010).
Unfortunately, the academic literature has not caught up with current
events, providing no significant guidance for U.S. leaders who grapple
with trying to sort out the nation’s strategic and ethical priorities in
Afghanistan.
Core Requirements and Recurring Issues
The academic literatures on nation-building, democratization, and
peacemaking are filled with recommendations for institution-building,
but between the opposing predictions and findings, the varied qual-
ity of evidence, and the sheer number of related studies, it is easy to
become overwhelmed. The purpose of this chapter is to systematically
lay out the various arguments applicable to the political objectives of
S&R, to indicate which are theoretical and which are supported by
evidence, and to highlight where there is an emerging expert consensus
and where the most important points of disagreement exist.
As a starting point we might ask, What features are most funda-
mental when contemplating post-conflict political development? Argu-
ably, the three most fundamental are that the government is
1. Stable: Free of internal or external threats to the nation, its con-
stitution, and governmental system.
2. Functioning: Able to make and implement effective decisions
and provide core services to the nation’s people.
3. Accountable: Subject to censure or removal if officials violate
established rules, laws, and rights.
70 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
These three features of quality governance are mutually rein-
forcing and, to a limited extent, mutually dependent. If progress lags
along one dimension, it will often hamper progress on the others—
for instance, poor government service provision can undermine stabil-
ity, or instability can hurt efforts to provide services. In some cases,
wealthy governments, such as those in the United Arab Emirates and
Singapore, have been able to overcome a developmental lag in one area
by overcompensating in another. Both governments are less account-
able to their citizens than most counties with commensurate gross
domestic product per capita levels, yet they provide extensive govern-
ment services, thereby dampening demands for public accountability.
Governments in countries emerging from war, however, not only lack
the ability to compensate for their shortcomings, their capabilities are
typically depleted to an extent that precludes progress along any of
these dimensions without outside assistance. Therefore, even though
S&R aims to move governments along all three paths, a stable, func-
tioning, and accountable government is an ambitious ideal to strive for,
well beyond the likely measure of operational success.
Figure 3.1 sketches a factor tree for governance consistent with
the above core attributes. It is a general factor tree based on the fac-
tors discussed in the literature as contributing to the quality of gover-
nance, but without prejudice as to the relative significance of the many
branches or how or at what level the various functions of government
should be accomplished. The factors, then, may be general, but what
approach is taken to governance, and what the balance among factors
must be, is another matter. The rest of the chapter is organized around
those matters. The next section examines the merits of stabilizing states
emerging from conflict by partitioning them into separate independent
entities. The chapter then discusses the important issue of what type
of regime should be contemplated. The section after that explores the
types of conflict-mitigating, power-sharing, and integrative political
mechanisms that are often a part of negotiated settlements. The chap-
ter concludes with a discussion of ways to build strong state-society
relations by encouraging greater transparency, civic participation, and
government accountability.
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 71
Territorial Partition
Before examining suggestions for establishing effective governing insti-
tutions and practices, it is helpful to first consider an option that could
potentially reduce the need for S&R operations, or at least minimize
their scope and duration. In the case of deeply entrenched and pro-
tracted struggles—many of which have an ethnic or sectarian basis—
several scholars have suggest that partitioning the country and provid-
ing former combatants control over their own territory and resources
is the best—and sometimes the only—path to peace (Horowitz, 1985;
Kaufmann, 1996, 1998; Mearshimer and Van Evera, 1995). Propo-
nents argue that establishing a border between protagonists limits their
interaction and, in turn, their opportunities for conflict (Rothchild

and Roeder, 2005, p. 11). Partitioning territories aims to resolve the
two central grievances that combatants fight over: inequality and
insecurity. First, if participants agree to the division, once they estab-
lish self-governance, the inequitable distribution of power and resources
becomes a moot point. Second, when they locate to defensible enclaves,
contending groups should feel more secure. Governance may also
improve. Because partition creates unified governments (within each of
the partitioned territories), it is assumed that they will be able to make
and implement decisions more easily than if rivals entered into a power-
sharing arrangement, in which governance could become paralyzed
by the divisive issues that drove the earlier conflict. Statistical studies
have found support for a relationship between partition and stability:
Research by Sambanis (2000) and Fortna (2004) indicates that after
civil wars, states that are partitioned experience fewer incidents of vio-
lence than those which result in power-sharing governments.
Yet, even if the resulting regimes had all of the stabilizing fea-
tures that partition proponents attribute to them, in many cases the
costs of partition may not be worth the rewards. Though there are
numerous precedents for partition—Ireland (1920), India and Paki-
stan (1947), Germany (1945), Korea (1953), Pakistan and Bangladesh
(1971), Cyprus (1974), and Yugoslavia (1995)—it is a solution that is
often politically and ethically problematic for the international com-
munity to support: No matter how calm and organized population
transfers may be, in many cases, partition can constitute a form of
ethnic cleansing 2 —a practice that violates international law (Kumar,
1997; Paris, 2004). In situations where mass migration is forced and
chaotic, the human and material toll can be enormous. Page Fortna
(2004) points out that Pakistan and India currently enjoy a cold peace,
yet she overlooks that to get to this point, nearly 2 million people lost
their lives and 12.5 million were displaced (Ahmed, 2002). Likewise,
Sambanis and Schulhofer-Wohl (2009) note that, while plausible, the
idea that policing a partition line is easier where populations are sep-
arated rather than intermixed has apparently not been satisfactorily
tested, due to the limited number of cases and the influence of con-
founding factors, such as international pressure (pp. 116–117).
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 73
Another problem with partition is that it can set a dangerous
precedent that leads to further disintegration. Once partition begins,
the question becomes: At what level of aggregation should the divisions
stop? In the case of Yugoslavia, many argued that partition into separate
republics would create a number of weak and nonviable states. How-
ever, once partition began, division along ethnic lines quickly evolved
from a limited solution to ethnic conflict to a “right” that could not
be denied to other groups. Further territorial division resulted, and an
even more dependent and fragile entity emerged, the Kosovo Autono-
mous Region, in 1999. Unable to defend itself against Serbia, its hostile
neighbor, Kosovo continues to rely on NATO troops.
Due to such costs, even advocates of partition agree that it should
be considered only under specific circumstances. If divisions have not
yet devolved into violence, groups may be able to amicably divide their
territory and have a “Velvet Divorce,” as was the case with Czechoslo-
vakia in 1993. The risks of partition are also more palatable when com-
batant groups are already concentrated into distinctive territories and
dislocations can be minimized (Sisk, 1996; Johnson, 2008). And finally,
if groups cannot live together under any circumstances, then—despite
its steep costs—separation or even formal partition may be preferable
to the destruction and possible genocide wrought by interminable con-
flict (Horowitz, 1985; Kaufmann, 1998). In such an extreme case, it is
important that the population transfer be handled by a trusted third
party, to ensure that it unfolds peaceably, and that supervision contin-
ues for a period afterward, to keep formerly civil conflicts from evolv-
ing into international wars or border clashes. Essentially, enforcement
of the partition agreement and directing population transfers is a type
of stability operation, but it involves a more modest set of objectives
than those operations that seek to reconstruct and stabilize war-torn
societies.
Regime Types
If partition does not occur and a more intensive stabilization operation
is in order, one of the most crucial tasks is creating governing institu-
74 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
tions that can maintain security and provide citizens with their basic
needs. For most of the 1990s, there was little debate among nation-
builders over which regime type could best achieve these goals. The
collapse of the Soviet Union and its communist-totalitarian satellites
was held up as proof of democracy’s superiority. Indeed, it seemed that
liberal democracy no longer had any plausible ideological competitors
and that history was unfolding in a way that recognized this (Fuku-
yama, 1992). The enthusiasm was sometimes excessive, for, as some
scholars (Paris, 2004) note, democracy was soon touted as the curative
for a host of societal ills, ranging from poverty to gender inequality,
international wars to domestic conflicts. Further, the duration and dif-
ficulty of democratic transitions, even under the best conditions—let
alone in a post-conflict environment—was often underestimated.
A number of individual country case studies and broader statis-
tical studies using cross-national, time-series data have indeed shown
that democracy tends to promote development and economic growth
(Jackman, 1973; Bollen, 1979; Burkhart and Lewis-Beck, 1994; Prze-
worski et al., 2000) and that democracies seldom fight each other
(Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman, 1992; Chan, 1984; Doyle 1986;
Maoz and Abdolali, 1989; Morgan and Schwebach, 1992; Rummel,
1997; Russett, 1993; Weede, 1992; Bueno de Mesquita et al., 1999),
yet democracy’s relationship to civil violence remains widely debated.
In the early 1990s, a string of post-conflict democratization success
stories (El Salvador, Mozambique, Namibia) lent support to the pro-
democracy camp, but by the mid 1990s, the horror stories of failed
nation-building experiences in Angola, Liberia, Somalia, and Bosnia
undermined confidence in the democratic cure-all—or, at least, in
the feasibility of racing toward alleged democracy being always wise.
Democracy, especially power-sharing democracy, still dominates rec-
ommendations for post-conflict regime formation, but emerging con-
cerns about the governing capacity of post-conflict democracies have
caused state-building scholars to consider less democratic options and
to rethink how to better sequence liberalization. The following subsec-
tions, then, compare different regime types and how they may or may
not be consistent with longer-term goals.
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 75
Autocracies
For obvious reasons, experts resist publicly extolling the “virtues of
authoritarianism” (Halperin, Siegle, and Weinstein, 2004, p. 1), but
objective assessments suggest that autocracy can have its virtues as well
as its vices. It is often assumed that authoritarian regimes are inher-
ently unstable because the succession process is often muddy (Olson,
1993), their societies lack social trust (Halperin, Siegle, and Weinstein,
2004, p. 104), and, in the long run, state oppression and exclusion may
trigger a popular insurrection (Hafez, 2004). However, for those very
reasons, autocrats sometimes use complex and adaptable strategies to
support their rule, using oppression only sparingly as a method of con-
trol. Autocrats win support by distributing resources through broad
patronage networks (Diaz-Cayeros, Magaloni, and Weingast, 2003)
and by building robust security sectors that can effectively deter rebel-
lious behavior, often simply by the threat of reprisals (Bellin, 2004).
According to a long series of studies, these pragmatic policies have paid
off: Consolidated authoritarian regimes 3 are found to be as stable as
established democracies (DeNardo, 1985; Francisco, 1995; Muller and
Weede, 1990; Hegre et al., 2001). While it may come as no surprise that
soft authoritarian regimes with high levels of economic development,
such as those in Singapore and Malaysia, remain firmly ensconced in
power, even harsh dictatorships in poor countries can last a long time:
Cameroon’s Paul Biya has remained in power for 27 years, while Hosni
Mubarak was Egypt’s president for 29 years.
Arguments highlighting the merits of post-conflict autocracies
come primarily from the democratization and economic develop-
ment literatures. It is posited that dictatorships—because they are less
beholden to popular support—are in a better position to initiate major
policy changes and stave off crises than democracies, where the electoral
cycle makes politicians beholden to particularistic concerns (Maravall,
1994). Not only are autocrats thought by some to be more effective
“universal agents” (Bhagwati, 1993), but also their strong security appa-
ratuses can put down threats before they grow into bigger challenges.
In contrast, democracies are good at promising perks in exchange for
cooperation, but due to their labored and inclusive decisionmaking,
they are less credible when it comes to enacting punishments.
76 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Cautions. Though superficially compelling, the argument for
ensconcing autocratic regimes in war-torn countries is difficult to sup-
port even if one puts aside idealism. In the first place, it appears that
the relationship between autocracy and stability is largely an artifact of
oil wealth (Marshall, 2008, p. 11). Though most authoritarian regimes
are poor, many autocratic, oil-producing states are highly stable due to
the public support engendered by their provision of financial resources
and public services (Ross, 2001; Smith, 2004). Second, even if authori-
tarian regimes were largely “stable,” if a large portion of a county’s
population is repressed and excluded, it can hardly be thought of as
peaceful (Doyle and Sambanis, 2006, p. 73). Third, nation-building
does not operate in a vacuum, and if the preexisting government was
an irredeemably weakened authoritarian regime that monopolized
power and excluded or oppressed its rivals, replacing it with a similar
system of government would not be palatable to either the population
or the international community. And finally, the case for supporting
authoritarian regimes is further eroded by the fact that the very things
that reportedly make consolidated autocracies stable are hard to come
by in a post-conflict environment. To maintain their position with-
out resorting to violence, autocrats need substantial resources for fund-
ing the security sector and appeasing supporters. When resources are
depleted—as is usually the case after prolonged conflicts—the govern-
ment often turns to preying on the resources of the poor and margin-
alized. Bates (2008b) discovered that civil wars in Africa were usually
preceded by periods of state predation that prompted victims to seek
protection from anti-government forces. This in turn provoked repres-
sive measures by the government and set in motion a downward secu-
rity spiral. Several studies have shown that repression by states with
weak institutions—as is often the case after conflict—reignites civil
wars (Hegre et al., 2001; Lichbach, 1995; Moore, 1998). Financial
resource depletion also undermines a government’s capacity to main-
tain elite support and to crack down effectively on dissent—two factors
that Lucan Way (2005) claims contributed to the “color revolutions”
that challenged authoritarian regimes in the former Soviet republics.
In sum, consolidated autocracies can in principle be stable, but with-
out the capacity to build strong institutions and support networks,
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 77
post-conflict autocracies typically remain weak, unconsolidated, and
unstable.
What all of this means is that the intervening authority needs to set
up a local government if it is not to stay forever, and popular consent and
representative forms offer the only means likely to be acceptable to the local
population and the international community.*
Democracies
Democracy has several properties that improve citizens’ welfare, but
here we limit our discussion to how it can help promote peace and
manage some of the challenges that post-conflict governments con-
front. In many respects, democracy appears well suited for states
emerging from war. There is an emerging scholarly consensus that
consolidated democracies 4 —like established autocracies—are highly
stable (Gurr, 1993; Hegre et al., 2001; Quinn, Mason, and Gurses,
2007; Rummel, 1997). However, quite the opposite is true for the type
of fledgling democracies that often emerge from peace negotiations
(Doyle and Sambanis, 2006; Gurr, 1993; Hegre et al., 2001; Mansfield
and Snyder, 2005). Hegre et al. (2001, p. 38) found that “intermediate”
democracies were four times more prone to civil war than consolidated
democracies, and regime type proved significant even when controlling
for the destabilization caused by regime change. A possible, yet insuffi-
ciently tested, explanation is that, due to institutional weakness, uncon-
solidated democracies lack the capacity and checks on power that in a
developed democracy discourage groups from resorting to “politics by
other means” (Huntington, 1968). Moreover, while democratic open-
ness and competition encourage dissent, unconsolidated democracies
lack well-established rules or institutions for resolving conflicts and are
more apt to resort to repression if challengers get out of hand (Hag-
gard and Kaufmann, 1995). The resulting loss of legitimacy can create
a security spiral that devolves into conflict. And finally, democracies
established in the aftermath of war face low odds of survival because
* Kuwait is the exception that proves the rule, the one case in which a preexisting nondemo-
cratic regime had not been discredited by the conflict and could be reinstalled with no effort
to reform or democratize it in the process.
78 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
they also feature many of the economic characteristics that undermine
democratic development and stability—namely, poverty, high inflation
rates, low levels of social development (Przeworski et al., 2000), and
low government revenues (Bates, 2008a, 2008b).
The fragility of unconsolidated democracies has prompted several
scholars to argue in favor of delaying electoral competition until the
conflict-mitigating aspects of a durable democracy (moderate parties,
the rule of law, a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, an active civil
society, cross-cutting cleavages, electoral rules that promote inclusion,
etc.) are put in place (Brancati and Snyder, 2010; Kumar and Ottaway,
1998; Mansfield and Snyder, 2005; Paris, 2004; Zakaria, 2003). As
Thomas Carothers (2007, p. 13) summarizes, advocates of sequencing
believe that “Pursuing a sequential path promises to rationalize and
defang democratic change by putting the potentially volatile, unpre-
dictable actions of newly empowered masses and emergent elected
leaders into a sturdy cage built of laws and institutions.” During the
transition phase, either an intervening power, the appointed authority,
or some sort of “peacekeeping agency” (Paris, 2004, p. 206) would be
responsible for shepherding the needed reforms and would step aside
once these democratic preconditions have been met.
Cautionaries About Sequencing. While on the surface the argu-
ment for sequencing sounds reasonable, implementation could be
fraught with obstacles. First, we live in a globalized world, and the
desire for elections and self-determination is found in many countries,
even among people who have never lived in a democracy. Elections are
not only a policy suggested by nation-builders; citizens also clamor for a
political voice and expect to be consulted on any issues that affect their
future. In Iraq in 2004, Ayatollah Sistani—who until that time was not
a known democrat—encouraged demonstrations and demanded that
the United States stop dragging its feet on promised elections. Despite
widespread violence on election day, Iraqis turned out in droves to exer-
cise their hard-won right to vote (Toensing, 2005, p. 8). Given the
popularity of elections, it is hard to conceive why citizens—who likely
suffered under the preceding conflict and lost trust in political elites—
would willingly submit to a paternalistic, “transitional” authority, even
if those in charge were their own countrymen. Second, if the authority
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 79
was indigenous, it would likely be autocratic (something that the advo-
cates of sequencing avoid saying). It is not clear what would motivate
autocrats to limit their own power by establishing the rule of law and
then, at a propitious moment of their choosing, surrender it completely
(Carothers, 2007, pp. 16–18). Third, from the perspective of interven-
ing powers, postponing a country’s elections and taking full responsi-
bility for the transitional period is a commitment that few are willing
or able to take, and even if they are, their commitment may quickly
erode as costs mount. Fourth, the premise of the sequencing argument
is that aspects of the regime type cause the instability associated with
post-conflict democratization. Rather, as Mason et al. (2007) points
out, the instability of post-conflict democracies is likely an artifact of
the preceding struggle.
While victors can impose democracies, such as the United States
did in Japan and Germany, more often post-conflict democracies
emerge as a result of inconclusive and protracted struggles. Because no
side can gain a monopoly on power, they seek out a “second-best solu-
tion” (Waterbury, 1994, p. 34) that can regulate, and perhaps resolve,
the dispute (Olson, 1993; Przeworski, 1991; Rustow, 1970). There
are several reasons why, regardless of regime type, such governments
would be unstable. Studies show, first, that young regimes are more
prone to conflict than older ones and, second, that recent war experi-
ence raises the likelihood of renewed violence (Doyle and Sambanis,
2006; Mason et al., 2007). And finally, post-conflict democracies are
typically formed by rivals with power parity—if one side had been sub-
stantially stronger, the conflict would have ended in a decisive victory.
Ironically, although parity makes democracy possible, it also makes it
fragile. Any change to the status quo that is perceived as benefiting one
side could change its opponent’s strategic calculus, suddenly raising
the appeal of a return to combat (a theme featured in the discussion of
security in Chapter Two of this volume).
While democracy is by no means a perfect solution, for combat-
ants involved in an interminable struggle, electoral competition pro-
vides a mechanism for managing and transforming disputes (Harris
and Reilly, 1998; Przeworski, 1991). Opponents compete for essentially
the same prize they vied for on the battlefield—political power—how-
80 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
ever, they win by gaining public support, not obliterating their ene-
mies. Being cut out of power is usually what causes groups to reignite
conflict, but it is argued that democracy lengthens the time horizons
of rivals, counteracting the zero-sum mentality that perpetuated the
earlier conflict. According to proponents, in democracies rival factions
are willing to accept short-term losses without resorting to violence,
because (1) elections hold out the possibility that their fortunes can
change and they could be in a stronger position to “advance their inter-
ests in the future” (Przeworski, 1991), and (2) they realize that the costs
of suppressing rivals exceeds the costs of regulated competition and
constrained power (Diamond, 1994, p. 3). Institutional constraints on
power—checks and balances, constitutional limitations, etc.—assure
electoral losers that winners will not be able to rule arbitrarily once in
office.
Democracy is also said to promote “good governance.” By way
of elections, “rulers are held accountable for their actions in the public
realm by citizens, acting indirectly through the competition and coop-
eration of their elected representatives” (Schmitter and Karl, 1991,
p. 76). In this way, elections can act as a vetting process that, theo-
retically, can weed out inferior candidates. Competition for votes is
a self-enforcing mechanism of accountability: Political elites have a
strong incentive to respond to the public interest in order to gain and
maintain power (Ferejohn, 1999, p. 131). In fact, simply the threat of
removal, or of reduced power, has been shown to make incumbents
more responsive to their constituents’ welfare (Posner, 1975; Troun-
stine, 2008). Effective and responsive governments can address prob-
lems before they evolve into destabilizing crises on which potential
spoilers can capitalize. For example, many predicted widespread social
protests in countries hit hard by the economic downturn in 2008–
2009, but, with a few notable exceptions, they either did not material-
ize or were calm expressions of public dissatisfaction. In the few coun-
tries where destabilizing mass protests emerged—Moldova, Georgia,
and Ukraine—governance had already been immobilized by political
power struggles (Onuch, 2009).
Cautions About Transitions to Democracy. The argument that
peaceful transitions from conflict to democracy can be brought about
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 81
through a convergence of interests and institutional engineering is
widely accepted in both practitioner and academic circles (Ghani and
Lockhart, 2008; Harris and Reilly, 1998; Reilly, 2001). Although there
are critics (Collier et al., 2003; Haggard and Kaufman, 1995), they
have not presented a revision of the essential logic. Instead they con-
tend that the incentives and punishments generated by electoral com-
petition alone are not enough to entice and sustain the cooperation of
combatants or to promote good governance. Critics of the institutional-
engineering approach to post-conflict democratization seek to extend
self-enforcing incentives beyond the electoral realm. They claim that to
persuade combatants to cooperate,
1. Benefits should accrue immediately.
2. Benefits need to be sustained.
3. Benefits should be guaranteed.
And, to persuade former combatants to continue working within
the newly established political order,
1. Punishments for reneging need to be assured (even if outside
enforcement is necessary).
2. Punishments need to be costly.
3. The benefits of returning to violence should be reduced.
The prescriptions for strengthening the conflict-mitigating effects
of democracy are found in the growing literature on post-conflict
power-sharing governments and accountability in state-society rela-
tions. They will be discussed in turn below.
Power-Sharing Mechanisms
Even though only 20 percent of civil war settlements result in some
form of negotiated power-sharing pact (Walter, 1997, p. 335), they
merit being explored here in greater detail because they also often
involve third-party interventions. According to Sisk (1996, p. 5),
82 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
power-sharing does not involve a specific formula, but rather includes a
lengthy menu of incentive structures that aim to build peace by
1. off-setting the costs and risks of demobilization
2. guaranteeing participants a role in decisionmaking
3. dissuading defection
4. integrating ascriptive identities into larger political groups that
cross-cut traditional cleavages.
What follows examines some of the institutional means of foster-
ing shared government and, when possible, will highlight the mecha-
nisms suggested for particular scenarios. However, at this generalized
level, little can be said about which institutional arrangements best fit
a specific context. Such an assessment should ideally involve an assess-
ment of the war’s outcome and the issues that combatants fought over,
the war’s toll on financial and physical resources, the population’s level
of heterogeneity, and the willingness of third parties to enforce and sup-
port political agreements. That said, a clear understanding of the logic
behind power-sharing governments, assorted institutional options, and
critiques of those options is also helpful to planners of S&R.
The Logic of Power-Sharing
At minimum, negotiated agreements need to provide the most threat-
ening potential spoilers some piece of the political pie (Diamond,
1994; Lijphart, 1977; Nordlinger, 1972). To be enticing, the size of
the piece should be commensurate with the participants’ capacity to
follow through on their threats. Some conflicts end in power-sharing
agreements in which the clearly dominant power offers the weaker
one limited concessions and a highly circumscribed and subordinated
decisionmaking role in exchange for an early truce. For more intrac-
table conflicts, involving rivals with commensurate odds of victory,
encouraging disarmament will likely require considerable perks for
each side and result in a virtual balance of power within the govern-
ment. It is these wars that tend to involve third-party interventions.
Suggested mechanisms for forging a power-sharing democracy include
oversized cabinets encompassing all major parties; “consensus-oriented
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 83
decision rules” (Harris and Reilly, 1998, p. 145); proportional represen-
tation multiparty systems; and low participation thresholds (Lijphart,
1994, p. 199). In contrast to mechanisms that promote peace through
“inclusion,” some power-sharing mechanisms create offsetting benefits
by partitioning power: Federalism grants regional groups greater con-
trol over subnational affairs, and bicameralism gives them a voice on
national issues, even if their population constitutes a national minority
(Harris and Reilly, 1998, p. 221).
Proponents contend that power-sharing arrangements reassure
parties that elections will not be zero-sum contests that result in “one
man, one vote, one time.” Mechanisms such as federalism, bicameral-
ism, the separation of powers, judicial review, and rigid constitutions
serve to decentralize political authority and prevent incumbents from
amassing the power to exclude rivals (Hartzell and Hoddie, 2003;
Lijphart, 1994, 1999). Opponents are willing to agree to consensus
policymaking, decentralized authority, and checks on power because
these restrictions also constrain their opponents. Hartzell and Hoddie
(2003) add that protagonists are further reassured when they share
power on multiple dimensions. Their study found that as the dimen-
sions of power-sharing increased, so too did the stability of the power-
sharing arrangement. The authors attribute this outcome to a “cumula-
tive effect on the actor’s sense of security, with the mutual dimensions
having the potential to become reinforcing” (p. 321). If implementa-
tion of one dimension of the power-sharing agreement fails, Hartzell
and Hoddie argue that the overall agreement is less likely to collapse as
long as progress on other dimensions continues (2003, p. 321).
Power-sharing can extend beyond territorial and political dimen-
sions to an apportionment of economic and military power. It is feared
that if incumbents obtained full control over a state’s financial resources,
they could use the resources to rearm and attack their rivals or, per-
haps economically marginalize them and provoke retaliation (Mason
et al., 2007, p. 10). To avoid a return to armed conflict, groups may
seek to “have the state displace or place limits on market competition,
directing the flow of resources through economic public choice policies
and/or administrative allocations to assist economically disadvantaged
groups” (Hartzell, 2006, p. 46). Economic power-sharing can be piv-
84 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
otal to regime stability if the conflict originated from perceived eco-
nomic inequities (Esman, 1987). If the basis of the conflict was inse-
curity, shared control over the military takes on greater significance.
Governments need to have a monopoly on the use of force to be seen as
legitimate, but after a war, protagonists hesitate to disarm for fear that
they will be left defenseless as the national army evolves into the per-
sonal militia of incumbents. Military power-sharing attempts to alle-
viate these fears by (1) initiating security-sector reforms that keep the
military out of politics (Ball, 2000), (2) disarming and demobilizing
former combatants, and (3) reintegrating those forces into the national
army (Hartzell and Hoddie, 2003). Walter (1997, p. 362) points out
that in a post-conflict environment—where the stakes of disarmament
are high and trust is at a low—building confidence may depend on
allowing rivals to maintain their arms temporarily or on incorporating
them into the national armed forces without forced disarmament.
Glassmeyer and Sambanis (2008) find that rebel integration into
the military is not strongly associated with peace, most likely due to the
poor implementation of the power-sharing agreement. In a combined
test of overlapping power-sharing agreements, other authors found that
relatively lower-cost power-sharing provisions pertaining to military or
territorial autonomy reinforce post-conflict peace, whereas high-cost
political-sharing agreements are often destabilizing (Derouen, Karl,
and Wallensteen, 2009).
Critiques of Power-Sharing
Four major objections have been raised about the ability of power-
sharing regimes to promote peace and stability. The first is that the
“stickiness” of power-sharing pacts is undemocratic. Critics point out
the inherent incompatibility between the “certainty” underpinning a
power-sharing agreement and the “uncertainty” that is the hallmark
of healthy democracy (Barry, 1975; Lustick, 1979; Przeworski, 1991).
Grand coalitions and strict seat allocations in legislatures essentially
dissolve the opposition and do not allow for the reins of power to
change hands—regardless of whether a party’s popularity wanes or the
electorate’s make-up evolves. The result is rule by an elite oligarchy
(Rothchild and Roeder, 2005, p. 36), and if elites become ensconced
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 85
and a political system cannot evolve, then new spoilers will arise who
feel that their interests are being ignored.
The second objection is that the “stickiness” and inclusiveness
of power-sharing agreements undermines government effectiveness
and promotes legislative atrophy, ultimately making the government
unworkable (Lijphart, 2002, p. 41; Rothchild and Roeder, 2005,
p. 36). Several studies have shown that, as a general rule, the more veto
players there are in a decisionmaking system, the harder it is to pass
policy changes, and, for those that do pass, the narrower they will be
(Cox and McCubbins, 2001; Tsebelis, 1995). Legislative atrophy can
in turn lead to conflict if groups resort to extra-constitutional methods
to fulfill unmet needs (Rothchild and Roeder, 2005).
Third, power-sharing mechanisms have been accused of politiciz-
ing ascriptive identities, thereby creating deeper social cleavages. Since
power-sharing agreements usually evolve from protracted wars, and
many of these tend to be ethnic conflicts, the post-war allocation of
seats and resources tends to, likewise, run along ethnic lines (Lijphart,
2002, p. 45). Ethnic identity becomes reified as the only issue that
matters, making problems that were already the source of past violence
increasingly combustible (Sisk, 1996, p. 39).
And finally, critics argue that even the sizable benefits of shared
rule are insufficient to maintain peace in precarious post-conflict
democracies. Given that the cost of disarmament could be complete
annihilation, the risks are too high for protagonists to be wooed by
carrots or by the assurances of their adversary (Walter, 1997, p. 335).
Critics who fault power-sharing regimes for their weak enforcement
capacity contend that the type of credible commitment needed to pre-
vent reneging can only be provided by external forces that have a clear
self-interest in peace and are therefore willing to make a sizable and
costly commitment of manpower and resources (Walter, 2002; Zart-
man, 1995, p. 272). According to Regan (1996, p. 341), only third
parties can make the costs of reneging prohibitive. Statistical studies
have supported the argument that power-sharing regimes are more
peaceful when third parties intervene (Walter, 1997; Doyle and Sam-
banis, 2006). And yet, critics question how in the long run it will be
possible for independent, self-enforcing institutions to develop under
86 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
the restrictions of power-sharing agreements and dependency on for-
eign powers. Bosnia provides one of the best examples of power-sharing
institutions being sustained while foreign intervention winds down, yet
given the continued weakness of its institutions, it is still too early to
declare the process a success.
Even if all of these criticisms were to hold true, however, they
would not invalidate the argument that power-sharing mitigates con-
flict. As Horowitz (1991, p. 472) points out, power-sharing could very
well be more successful than it appears because it is mainly applied in
difficult circumstances, such as when states are ethically divided or
protagonists are evenly matched. Both situations present acute chal-
lenges for any state trying to consolidate and rebuild, regardless of
whether they adopt power-sharing mechanisms. Under such precari-
ous circumstances, the choice set is limited: Allowing challengers to
fight to the finish would decimate the society, and no side can win
decisively enough to set up its own government. Thus, even though
the stability of shared governments is questionable, it is often the best
option available.
Federalism
Since the end of the Cold War, most state failures and civil conflicts
have been blamed on ethnic strife. Seeking a way to manage these vio-
lent conflicts, nation-builders have increasingly promoted federalism
because it reportedly offers a way to maintain a unified and viable state,
while simultaneously satisfying (at least in part) minority yearnings for
autonomy and enfranchisement (Brinkerhoff, Johnson, and Hill, 2009,
p. 8). Federalism involves different models for mixing a central (and
to various degrees, shared) government with self-government. Power
devolves from the central government to the various subnational units,
and each level has jurisdiction over different issues, with the central
government typically retaining control over national policy and secu-
rity concerns (Monteux, 2006). Decentralization is not always limited
to political issues. In fiscal federalism, subnational units can acquire the
power to collect revenue or make fiscal decisions. The opposite of feder-
alism would be a wholly unified state, in which decisions on all matters
came from the top echelons of the government without any differentia-
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 87
tion in policies across regions. While federalism usually involves grant-
ing semi-autonomy to subnational regions, when ethnic groups are not
geographically concentrated they may adopt a form of multicultural
federalism that grants ethnic/sectarian groups autonomy over certain
issues, as is done in Canada and Switzerland (Tremblay, 2005).
Arguments in favor of post-conflict federalism emphasize its effect
on peace, democracy, and policymaking. Constitutional provisions
allow minorities to protect and further their own interests, while restric-
tions on the central government help reduce fears of being exploited by
the majority (Lijphart, 2002, p. 52). In a cross-national study as well as
case studies comparing federal India with unitary Bangladesh, Pippa
Norris finds support for the claim that federal systems are “associated
with stronger democratic performance” than unitary states (2008,
p. 184). Federalism, proponents contend, enhances democracy because
it promotes inclusion by creating more points of entry into the gov-
ernment system. It also improves representation by creating electoral
incentives for national politicians to respond to subnational concerns
in their quest to win or retain office. Both inclusion and representatives
help improve minorities’ sense of security and, in doing so, are said to
indirectly enhance stability (Norris, 2008, pp. 159–161). With respect
to policymaking, supporters of federalism claim that the centralized
decisionmaking of unitary governments produces cookie-cutter regu-
lations and policies that do not fit local circumstances and, therefore,
can potentially provoke hostilities. In contrast, federalism encourages
subnational representatives to formulate more-efficient policies that are
tailored to address their local constituency’s concerns (Keman, 2000).
Skeptics, however, claim that federalism has the exact opposite
effect: In their eyes, federalism is destabilizing, undemocratic, and inef-
fective. According to Hale (2004), districting based on ethnic identity
discourages compromise and consensus and instead encourages local
politicians to “play the ethnic card”—fomenting xenophobia and feel-
ings of superiority in order to win support. If left to fester, these feel-
ings can trigger demands for succession (Simeon and Conway, 2001).
Critics contend that as minorities’ commitment to the state diminishes,
it will prompt the state to impose control, perhaps triggering a desta-
bilizing security spiral. Federalism can also be destabilizing because
88 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
regions of the state and levels of government can develop at differ-
ent rates, causing problematic disparities. Successful nation-building
efforts need to be both bottom-up and top-down, but if the gover-
nance, security, and development capacity of local communities sur-
passes that of the central government, federal divisions can become a
centrifugal force that fosters disintegration. Some scholars suggest that
federalism is not sustainable in many parts of the world because it is the
natural tendency of central governments to resist power devolution and
the diminishment of their sovereignty (de Figueiredo, Rui, and Wein-
gast, 2005, p. 104; Horowitz, 1991, pp. 452–453). What is feasible also
depends on prior experience and current expectations; it is difficult to
impose wholly unfamiliar arrangements (e.g., federalism) on societies.
Some critics consider federalism undemocratic because citizens
are not treated equally. It can result in different conditions, opportu-
nities, treatment, and rights across subnational units. Before 1971, for
instance, Pakistan was divided into two provinces with equal seats in
the legislature, even though the Bengali population of Eastern Paki-
stan was much larger than the Mahajir-dominated population in the
West. As a result, the power of the Eastern vote was diluted, contribut-
ing to Western dominance over Pakistani politics and the military. The
imbalance culminated in a civil war that split East from West Paki-
stan, creating the independent country of Bangladesh. Additionally, it
is suggested that the multiple levels of bureaucracy in a federal arrange-
ment muddy accountability by making it less clear who is responsible
for policies and problems (Norris, 2008, p. 162).
With regard to government effectiveness, other scholars add that
the duplication of administrative functions and bureaucracy under
federal governments makes transactions inefficient and more complex
(Ranson and Stuart, 1994). In addition to eroding efficiency, federal-
ism is also accused of hindering decisiveness because—as mentioned in
the power-sharing section—as the number of decisionmakers in a gov-
ernment grows, more interests must be accommodated, thus making it
harder to legislate and govern.
It is difficult to test predictions of federalism’s conflict-mitigating
effects because, according to Lake and Rothchild (2005, p. 114), other
than Bosnia and Iraq, there have been no attempts since World War II
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 89
to establish decentralized postwar governments. The notable absence
of decentralized governments is perhaps a sign that “warring parties
may know something that policy enthusiasts in the West have yet to
learn (Lake and Rothchild, 2005, p. 112). Even in the absence of a civil
war, Lake and Rothchild find that decentralized arrangements are not
as long-lasting as unified states and that they tend to evolve toward
greater centralization (p. 114). Another study finds that when ethnic
groups are intermingled, rather than geographically concentrated, fed-
eralism does not appear to help manage ethnic conflict (Mozaffar and
Scarritt, 1999). Hence, there currently is not a clear case for the benefits
of federalism in a post-conflict context. However, most experts claim
that this is due to the inherent instability of the circumstances that
necessitate any type of power-sharing arrangement and that federal-
ism remains one of the best ways to facilitate agreement among former
combatants.
Governing Institutions
As stated previously, the goal for state-builders in post-conflict environ-
ments is to foster stable, functioning, and accountable governments.
For power-sharing governments, that specifically means selecting an
executive configuration (presidential or parliamentary, see Table 3.1)
and an electoral system (plurality/majoritarian or proportional repre-
sentation, see Table 3.2) that both (1) promote inclusion of potential
spoilers, representation of minority interests, moderation, and the abil-
ity to identify and punish errant representatives and (2) discourage
deadlocks and the concentration of power. Meeting these objectives
is a tall order for state-builders, made all the more difficult by the fact
that progress on one front can lead to setbacks on others.
Consociationalism. In the quest to engineer governments that can
manage conflicts in deeply divided societies, a general consensus has
emerged based on a theory termed consociationalism. According to the
consociational argument, institutions that bring elites from each group
together for consultation and consensus-building, and that create bar-
riers to keep power from becoming concentrated in the hands of one
party, are the keys to stability in divided societies. The theory is most
90 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
closely associated with the work of Arend Lijphart (e.g., Lijphart, 1977),
who described consociational governments as having specific attributes:
• A coalition cabinet that shares executive power among parties.
Rather than adopting a minimum winning governing coalition,
the aim is to have oversized coalitions that include more parties
than are needed to win office.

Prototypical Executive Configurations
Executive
Configuration Description
Presidential Characterized by a separation of executive and legislative
authority. The legislature makes laws, while the president
“presides” over their execution. The president and legislators are
elected separately, from different constituencies, and neither
branch can unseat the other. a Both branches check the other’s
actions: Presidents can veto legislation, and legislators can
override vetoes.
Parliamentary Executive and legislative authority is fused. Members of the
executive cabinet are drawn from the legislature and are
responsible for both introducing and executing legislation. To
remain in power, the prime minister and cabinet must enjoy the
support of the legislature. When the legislature lacks confidence
in the government (expressed through a no-confidence vote),
cabinet members must resign. Likewise, it is the prerogative of
the prime minister to dissolve parliament and call new elections.

Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 91
• A balance of power between the executive and legislature. Though
presidential systems are based on a separation of powers, Lijphardt’s
other specifications make it clear that he prefers a parliamentary
system. Hence, he suggests procedural methods for balancing
that weaken both legislators’ ability to vote out the cabinet, and
the prime minister’s ability to call new elections.
• Decentralized and federal representation so that minority and local
interests can be addressed.
• Bicameralism, with each house composed of members represent-
ing different (typically regional and national) interests.
• Proportional representation that allows minorities to gain represen-
tation (Lijphart, 1999, pp. 42–45).
Consociationalism is often contrasted with majoritarianism,
which Lijphardt and others criticize for allotting seats only to the larg-
est parties, thereby disenfranchising large portions of the population. In
addition to the consociational literature, a prominent argument found
in democratic development studies argues that parliamentary regimes
are more stable than presidential systems because, due to the separa-
tion of powers, the executive and legislative branches can be controlled
by different parties, a condition that may in turn produce legislative
deadlocks. Instability may ensue if actors attempt to settle the impasse
through unconstitutional means (Linz, 1978; Linz and Stepan, 1996).
Indeed, there is considerable evidence that parliamentary governments
have historically lasted longer than presidential regimes (Cheibub and
Limongi, 2002; Harris and Reilly, 1998; Przeworski et al., 2000). Pre-
scriptions based on both arguments are commonly featured within
the practitioner literature for state-building and S&R (Brahimi, 2007;
Sisk, 1996).
Recent critiques of the consociational and democratic develop-
ment literatures point out, however, that many of the mechanisms they
support often do not produce the assumed results (inclusion, compro-
mise, stability, etc); conversely, those mechanisms they reject often per-
form better than expected. For instance, in an article that contradicts
much of the conventional wisdom concerning institutional and elec-
toral engineering, Cheibub and Limongi (2002, pp. 175–176) find that
92 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Parliamentary systems do not operate under a “majoritarian
imperative”; deadlock is not as frequent as supposed under presi-
dentialism and is not absent from parlimentarism; coalition gov-
ernments are not foreign to presidential systems and emerge for
the same reasons as they do in parliamentary systems; decision-
making is not always centralized under parliamentarism and is
not always decentralized under presidentialism.
In a different study, Reilly (2005, pp. 165–166) finds that the
assumed connections among proportional representation electoral sys-
tems, inclusive executives, and stability are not borne out in practice.
Although proportional representation systems typically lead to inclu-
sive executives, and most stable, ethnically divided democracies have
inclusive executives, the majority of stable, ethnically divided democ-
racies do not have proportional representation electoral systems. Possi-
ble explanations are that proportional representation systems may help
fractured societies initiate democratization, but they can be destabiliz-
ing during the consolidation phase because they make room for extrem-
ist parties that can undermine functional governance by entrenching
the “perception that all politics must be ethnic politics” (Reilly and
Reynolds, 1999, p. 31). Barkan (1995) shows that, in countries where
ethnic groups are geographically concentrated, contrary to common
expectations, first-past-the-post voting in single member districts can
often represent minorities better than a proportional representation
system. The list of critiques is too lengthy to adequately summarize
here, and to do so would obscure what may be the most important
takeaway for practitioners. The point of these works is not to say that
there is a better institutional formula for achieving inclusive, moderate,
and stable governments; rather, they challenge the notion that sustain-
able governance can be achieved by adopting a one-size-fits-all model.
Contrasting the successful, multistaged development of South Afri-
ca’s constitution, which was constructed by an interim government of
National Unity, with the “messy” constitutional processes in Iraq and
Afghanistan that involved much foreign meddling, Lakhdar Brahimi
(2007, p. 9), former UN Special Representative to Afghanistan and
Iraq, argues,
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 93
The tendency to prescribe universal constitutional advice, and
broad rules and regulations that do not fit the country context
and are not underpinned by broad, inclusive and participatory
inputs from national populations must be resisted. The historic,
cultural, institutional, ethnic and linguistic differences among
countries cannot be ignored. Generic constitutional provisions
cannot be indiscriminately applied to highly individualized con-
texts. Ignoring these basic principles leads to problems of sub-
stance and process at both the micro and macro levels.
Once state-builders have an in-depth understanding of a country’s
history, the balance of power among elites, demographic factors, and
attitudes toward leadership and fairness, they can select among a wide
variety of options for forming a government that displays the qualities
mentioned above: inclusivity, accountability, moderation, and the abil-
ity to avoid deadlocks and high concentrations of power. The options
for building such a government go well beyond the choice of executive
type and electoral system. They include open and closed party candi-
date lists; transferable votes; rules for introducing, vetoing, and over-
riding legislation; electoral inclusion thresholds; gerrymandering; term
limits; and a host of other factors. Hence state-builders have many tools
at their disposal for constructing governments that meet a country’s
specific needs and for offsetting any potential drawbacks.
Connecting the Government and the Governed
Thus far, the focus of this chapter has been on the formation of stable
governments that keep potential spoilers engaged by offering them a
place at the table and reducing the threat of incumbents accumulat-
ing unchecked power. This section shifts the focus from balancing
relationships within the government to stabilizing the relationship
between the government and the governed. This relationship is crucial
to future stability—regardless of relations within the government, if
citizens believe their needs are not being met or that the government
has violated “norms of fairness,” they may withdraw their consent to
be governed and cease their compliance (Levi, 1997, p. 35), signal-
94 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
ing a loss of state control and legitimacy that can lead to a popular
revolt or reignite previous conflicts (Brinton, 1938, p. 209; Goldstone,
2001, p. 150). Public disapproval of the government can be expressed
through what the economist Alfred O. Hirschman (1970) termed
“voice” (attempts to repair relations by expressing dissatisfaction) or
by “exit” (withdrawing from the relationship). (Warning signs of exit
include refugees, brain drain, “desertion of the intellectuals,”5 tax eva-
sion, expansion of the informal economy, employing private militias,
and desertion.) To stabilize governments and discourage exit, it is cru-
cial that citizens have the ability to voice their concerns and that there
are incentives in place that encourage political leaders to hear them and
respond. These conditions are achieved by establishing a self-enforcing
bargain between citizens and their government in which each is better
off cooperating than if they acted alone.
The Modern Social Contract
The bargain that establishes social order is based on Jean Jacques Rous-
seau’s concept of the “social contract”: essentially, a mutually agreed
upon exchange whereby the population gives up some of its freedom
for government-provided security, while the government allows limits
to its power in exchange for popular acceptance of its authority, i.e.,
legitimacy (Bendix, 1977, p. 167). The foundation of this bargain has
grown considerably since Rousseau’s time; in addition to security, it
now covers a host of obligations that the government needs to meet if
it is to receive legitimacy and compliance. These include the provision
of civil rights, a system of justice, essential services, and a function-
ing economic system (Ghani and Lockhart, 2008; USIP, 2009). Even
though the bargain is theoretically mutually agreed upon and makes
state-society relations better in the long-term, it is an abstraction that
depends on the actions of individual politicians, citizens, and groups
whose personal or immediate circumstances are often better served by
complete rejection (exiting) or by “cheating”—trying to obtain the
agreement’s benefits without paying the costs. To deter cheating and
exiting, it is incumbent on state-builders to establish self-enforcing
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 95
incentive structures that make the actions of citizens and politicians
transparent and that consistently hold them accountable. These con-
cepts will be explored in greater detail below.
The discussion of fostering stable relations between governments
and citizens proceeds below by, first, exploring the mutual obliga-
tions between the government and the governed; second, addressing
the methods used by both sides to try to renege on their obligations
without losing the benefits of the original bargain; and, third, conclud-
ing with an examination of what is needed to ensure that each side is
accountable and upholds their side of the bargain.
Before beginning this discussion, a minor caveat is in order.
Scholarly and practitioner literatures typically group several of the obli-
gations and incentive structures mentioned below under the heading
of “the rule of law.” Indeed, the rule of law can encompass issues as
varied as civil rights, judicial reform, transparency, and police training.
To avoid ambiguity, the term has been used here sparingly, and instead
the discussion focuses on the specific aspects of the rule of law that are
central to the government-governed relationship.
State-Society Obligations
The obligations that form the basis for state-society relations in most
stable democracies, and which are a primary objective of state-builders,
are listed in Table 3.3. This can be seen as describing the de facto social
contract in a different way, one that shows indirectly related topics
rather than direct exchanges. For example, governments derive legiti-
macy not just from accepting constraints on their authority but also
from providing security, public services, and a judicial system. Like-
wise, by paying taxes, citizens underwrite much of what the state pro-
vides, not simply public services.
Although not discussed here at length, corruption is a very impor-
tant problem in many states relevant to this book. It exists everywhere
to some degree and in significant measure in many countries as part
of the ordinary routine, yet substantial corruption represents a seri-
ous failure of the state and corrodes everything. As stated in a USAID
document devoted to the subject:
96 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
No problem does more to alienate citizens from their political
leaders and institutions, and to undermine political stability
and economic development, than endemic corruption among
the government, political party leaders, judges, and bureaucrats.
(USAID, 2002)
Constrained Authority and Legitimacy. Popular expectations for
state-society relations vary according to a country’s culture and political
legacy. Yet, in nearly all societies—even most modern monarchies—
leaders claim to rule at the behest of the people, asserting that it is from
popular consent (often loosely defined) that they derive their legitimacy
(Dogan, 2009). Citizens do not, however, give their consent freely.
Fearing predation if leaders exercise unfettered power, citizens demand
that governments be bound by laws that provide clear rights to indi-
viduals and corporate entities in exchange for their acceptance of state
authority. Therefore, crafting constitutions that clearly stipulate duties
and protections and contain self-binding mechanisms is not a recom-
mended priority for state-builders simply because establishing human
rights is a laudable goal; without an unambiguous statement of what
states give up and what citizens receive, popular legitimation can also
be withheld, and the entire state-building venture can be over before
it has begun. Not only will state-building flounder, but, according to
Mati Dogan (2009, p. 196), “Less legitimacy translates into more coer-

cion,” presenting the prospect of greater oppression, civil violence, or
both. By agreeing to submit to the rule of law and make their behavior
predictable, governments receive voluntary cooperation from citizens.
This exchange leads to an environment that typically encourages pri-
vate investment, reduces the cost of enforcing compliance, and bolsters
international legitimacy (Ghani and Lockhardt, 2008, p. 126). A vir-
tuous cycle of legitimacy takes shape as each consequence of adhering
to the rule of law in turn legitimates the state and its legal foundation.
This process of legitimation is what the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development has termed process legitimacy: legiti-
macy derived from abiding by and maintaining the constitutional rule
of law (OECD, 2008, p. 2).
According to the logic of the social contract, those in power,
and those they govern, abide by the law because doing so makes them
better off than when they breach it (Weinstein, 2005, p. 8; Maravall
and Przeworski, 2003, p. 3). Yet in states emerging from conflict, or
those in which a low-level conflict continues, both the state and society
are weak and may not have the capacity to maintain their respective
side of the bargain. For example, even though national political leaders
may act to fulfill their obligations, they may not be able to guarantee
that provincial representatives will do the same. Also, if a government’s
reach is limited, citizens may feel they have no choice but to collabo-
rate with rebels who either coerce their loyalty or win it by providing
benefits (Kalyvas, 1999; Wood, 2010). Hence, in fragile states the pur-
ported benefits of the social contract may not be forthcoming, despite
the best of intentions. In addition, civil conflicts typically sow distrust
between states and citizens, whereby sides may be unwilling to entrust
their future to a risky relationship of mutual dependence. This lack of
trust can cause an intractable coordination problem: While the social
contract can serve the interests of both sides, fearing the vulnerabil-
ity of cooperating when the other side reneges keeps both sides from
submitting to the law. Due to the reluctance created by post-conflict
uncertainty, third-party supervision and enforcement may be neces-
sary to encourage submission, to nurture cooperation-supporting social
norms, and to provide side benefits to sweeten the deal, at least until
a moderate level of government capability and social trust is restored.
98 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
The causal relationship between third-party participation and popu-
lar submission is often too obscure to see, but it is readily apparent in
situations that involve repatriation. For instance, the United Nations
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) guaranteed the safe
return of refugees and provided money to buy land and establish
homesteads. Without UNTAC supervision, it is unlikely that so many
refugees would have returned, especially if doing so had required them
to entrust their safety to the former combatants who had caused them
to flee. Although the government of Cambodia still acts with impunity
at times, the contribution of international aid to the national budget
and the presence of international development agencies are thought to
have a constraining effect on government actions. As with the power-
sharing agreements discussed earlier, the greater the size and certainty
of both benefits and punishments, the more likely it is that govern-
ments and citizens will submit to being bound by the law.
System of Justice and Compliance. A social contract is rendered
meaningless without institutions that are adequately empowered to
enforce the law. A functioning system of justice requires a uniform and
rational framework of laws, judicial infrastructure, regulatory agen-
cies, and well-trained officers, judges, and administrators. To be seen as
credible, such a system should provide equal access to justice and equal
accountability before the law. Furthermore, there is a general consen-
sus in the literature that the rule of law cannot be achieved without
judicial independence, especially in the case of constitutional courts.
The judiciary is considered independent when it is politically insu-
lated from the other branches of government and from private or par-
tisan interests (Ferejohn, 1998–1999; Helmke and Rosenbluth, 2009).
Independence also means that judicial decisions are not influenced by
individual judges’ personal interests (Stepenson, 2001). And, finally,
the presence of a rule-of-law culture in which the public believes that
laws are legitimate and that the courts are fair and effective arbiters for
meting out justice helps the establishment of a functioning, indepen-
dent legal system (USIP, 2009, pp. 7–65). Dobbins et al. point out that
“Without a widely shared cultural commitment to the idea of rule of
law, courts are just buildings, judges just employees, and constitutions
just pieces of paper” (2007, p. 88).
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 99
Both states and citizens have much to gain from a functioning
and independent justice system. National governments impose their
authority and maintain public order through such institutions as
courts, police, and regulatory agencies. Although limited coercion—or
the threat of it—also contributes to public compliance, independent
courts can compel compliance in a less costly manner because they are
seen as protectors of the public interest. By performing a constitutional
review of the legislative and executive branches, independent courts
enforce laws passed by the legislative body and prevent either of the two
branches from encroaching into the other’s jurisdiction (Ely, 1980). In
addition to maintaining law and order, an independent judiciary also
functions to create an environment conducive to business activity and
investment by delineating and protecting contract and property rights
(Brunetti, Kisunko, and Weder, 1997; Feld and Voigt, 2003). Systems
of justice provide citizens with access to recourse and redress, thereby
discouraging the pursuit of justice by extralegal means. They also pro-
tect individuals and groups from arbitrary state action and prevent the
infringement of their civil and political liberties (Heller, 2000).
In post-conflict societies, establishing such an independent judi-
cial system is fraught with difficulties. War-torn states often lack com-
petent individuals to staff the judiciary, either because they had a negli-
gible or corrupt legal system to begin with or because educated citizens
fled the fighting and/or pursued better opportunities abroad. In the
most extreme case of human resource depletion, the Khmer Rouge,
who ruled Cambodia from 1975–1979, killed most of the country’s
educated population. The Vietnamese-backed regime that followed
provided few opportunities for legal training. As a result, a 2004 UN
report found that Cambodia had only 200 judges and 275 lawyers
(McGrew, 2009, p. 275).
Another obstacle to judicial independence is the natural reluc-
tance of politicians to empower any institution that infringes on
their authority. Leaders have some incentive to at least initiate judi-
cial reforms, since doing so bestows upon them kudos for engaging
in good governance. Moreover, international financial institutions are
more than willing to provide funding to enact such reforms. However,
those same institutions have proved very lax at monitoring implemen-
tation of judicial reforms. Ruling politicians shirk from engaging in
100 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
meaningful implementation, since the newly empowered courts may
later challenge their actions (Finkel, 2008). Independent courts may
also threaten those in power because they can function as focal points
around which civil society can mobilize against the ruling body, as has
happened in Egypt (Moustafa, 2007) and, most notably, in Pakistan,
where nationwide protests against the dismissal of judges forced Gen-
eral Pervez Musharraf to resign the presidency (Perlez, 2009). Since
leaders view judicial reform as a threat, to promote independent judi-
ciaries, state-builders must think of incentives that can offset politi-
cians’ concerns.
While several scholars and policymakers have hinted at the prob-
lems involved with meaningful implementation, very few have pro-
posed concrete solutions. Of those few, Ginsberg (2003) finds that if
electoral uncertainty exists at the time of drafting, constitutions tend
to support stronger and more independent courts. He also finds that
once promulgated, constitutions are more successfully implemented if
there is a diffuse political environment that provides the court more
potential allies (parties, nongovernmental organizations, etc.) if it
decides to rule against an institution of the state. By examining judi-
cial reform efforts in Latin America, Finkel (2008, p. 31) provides a
nuanced explanation for this pattern. She finds that when a ruling par-
ty’s political future is in doubt, it is more willing to pay the costs of
empowering the court while the party is in office in order to gain the
long-term goal of reducing the risks should it become the opposition.
Helmke and Rosenbluth (2009) cite a similar phenomenon in South
Korea, where exiting authoritarian leaders faced an uncertain electoral
future and suddenly, while still in power, began to work on establish-
ing independent constitutional courts. These studies provide important
insights for state-builders as to the conditions needed to establish inde-
pendent courts and the rule of law:
• Pluralist systems produce more potential for judicial reform than
political systems with centralized power.
• Having multiple strong parties and civic organizations can pro-
tect courts that act independently.
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 101
• Although it is tempting to make strict power-sharing agree-
ments, electoral uncertainty is not just necessary for a functioning
democracy, it is an important impetus for judicial reform.
Security and Conscripts. While countries differ significantly in
terms of the mutual expectations for governments and citizens, one
commonly held expectation is that governments are responsible for
security. Security provision is the linchpin for all aspects of state-
building. Governments are difficult to form without ceasefires and
peace agreements. Social and economic development needs the cer-
tainty of a peaceful environment to thrive. And, government legiti-
macy depends on popular acceptance of the state’s monopoly on the
use of force. Since Chapter Two treats security issues in more detail,
this section will address just one element of security provision that
bears on state-society relations—military conscription. A person’s will-
ingness to die for his or her country indicates a strong identification
with the nation, as well as support for the ruling establishment (or at
least the system that brought it into power). Both beliefs boost pros-
pects for state-building. Conscription may not be a popular policy, but
when citizens believe that their government is legitimate and acting in
their interest, they will comply (Levi, 1997). Mass desertion or draft
dodging signals that citizens do not believe the government has the
right to impose its authority over them. In the 1980s, Afghan rejec-
tion of the Soviet-installed Babrak Karmal regime was readily apparent
as thousands of young men fled the country to escape serving in the
Soviet-controlled army. If the state cannot provide security, citizens
will turn to those who can, thereby weakening the state and empower-
ing its enemies (Kalyvas, 1999).
Conscription is more than a measure of government support—it
can also be an avenue for building social cohesion and national iden-
tity in fractured states. Even though all-volunteer armies tend to have
higher-quality troops, drafting soldiers into an organization in which
they need to cooperate with individuals they previously fought against
has the possible benefits of reducing social tensions and keeping poten-
tial recruits for rebel organizations gainfully employed and under state
control.
102 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Provision of Goods and Services and Taxes. It is widely recog-
nized that, in addition to security, providing essential services is a criti-
cal need in post-conflict peacebuilding (Dobbins et al., 2003). As dis-
cussed in Chapters Six and Seven, assistance should initially take the
form of emergency humanitarian relief, but the focus should later shift
to strengthening governmental and societal capacity to provide for the
nation’s needs. This includes laying the foundation for a functioning
economic system, an educational system, an effective civil service to
administer government programs, and a system of health services and
sanitation.
Providing essential services does much more than ingratiate gov-
ernments with their publics: It enhances their legitimacy and, in turn,
contributes to greater security (OECD, 2008, p. 2). Unmet expecta-
tions or the unequal distribution of resources can cause social fragmen-
tation and lead to conflict. Collier (2000) argues that failure to provide
services can also be an indirect cause of instability. He suggests that
when governments cannot provide employment opportunities or assis-
tance to the population, the price of labor plummets, easing insurgent
recruitment (for a different analysis, see discussion of work by Berman
and Felter in Chapter Six).
Pressure for the provision of essential services creates a revenue
imperative that links states and societies in a mutually beneficial rela-
tionship conducive to state-building and stability. When individuals
and businesses are required to pay taxes, they develop a stake in the
“performance and accountability of state institutions” (OECD, 2008,
p. 3). The small breakaway territory of Somaliland is an example of
the impact that these dynamics can have on state formation. Taxes
from businesses make up most of that state’s revenue, and, as a result,
authorities have adopted business-friendly economic policies, limited
commercial risk, and controlled state coercion and corruption (Reno,
2006, p. 170). Consequently, business leaders and tribal elders remain
supportive of the political order.
There also seems to be mounting support for the theory that taxa-
tion is causally linked to representation. According to the general argu-
ment, government dependency on tax revenue allows the public to
make demands on the government, which typically translate into civil
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 103
rights, the rule of law, and political representation (Bräutigam, Fjeld-
stad, and Moore, 2008, p. 10). Michael Ross (2001) tested numerous
versions of the “taxation leads to representation” argument and found
that “higher taxes relative to government services tend to make states
more democratic.” Other studies have shown that states with plenti-
ful natural resources that do not need to tax their societies—such as
the Gulf oil monarchies—are less democratic (Fish, 2002; Ross, 2001;
Tsui, 2005).6
The connections between government service provision, legiti-
macy, and taxation have important implications for state-building.
First, if officials are to gain public trust, they should carefully ana-
lyze the source of previous conflicts before deciding how resources
should be distributed or extracted. For example, while the civil war in
Sri Lanka ran along ethnic lines, the government’s policy of granting
1,000 houses to each ethnic group did not result in “horizontal equity”;
rather, it perpetuated the real reason for the war, resource inequality
(Anand, 2005, p. 12). Second, while building the state’s revenue col-
lection capability is important, in order for revenue imperatives to pro-
duce legitimacy and representation dividends it is also important to
support civic and business associations to strengthen their voice and
leverage vis-à-vis the government (Englebert and Tull, 2008, p. 139).
Third, prolonged large-scale assistance can ostensibly have antidemo-
cratic properties. It dampens the government’s dependence on its citi-
zens, weakening the public’s ability to hold their leaders accountable.
In contrast, International Monetary Fund and World Bank stabiliza-
tion and structural adjustment programs—which are often criticized
as being antidemocratic because they dictate terms to fiscally weak
governments—can foster accountability and representation by forcing
governments to balance their budgets and improve revenue streams
(Ross, 2004, pp. 247–248).
Cheating and Bias
Despite the fact that governments and citizens can often improve their
lot by cooperating with each other within the confines of mutual obli-
gations and duties, each side would be even better off—in a narrow
sense—if it could make all the gains of a social contract without paying
104 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
the costs. Without transparency and accountability, the chances of
being caught for transgressions are low, and governments and citizens
will try to gain an advantage and avoid meeting their obligations by
cheating or biasing the system. Citizens cheat by evading taxes and
circumventing laws—actions that may or may not indicate disapproval
with the government (however, as mentioned above, when cheating
takes place on a large scale, it may signal mass rejection of the govern-
ing system). To deter the public from cheating, states need to maintain
social control through effective policing and oversight agencies; yet, if
left unchecked, government authorities can abuse this power and deny
citizens their civil liberties. Politicians are not only tempted to over-
reach their authority—the imperatives of electoral competition and
their desire to remain in power often compel them to establish biased
political arrangements that reduce uncertainty about their future
(Trounstine, 2008, p. 21). According to Trounstine (p. 32), types of
biasing and the mechanisms employed might include
• Information Bias: state control over the media or voluntary asso-
ciations to limit the information available to citizens
• Vote Bias: poll taxes, registration laws, vote fraud, or vote buying
(patronage distribution) to advantage incumbents and raise the
costs of entry for new political actors
• Seat Bias: gerrymandering, malapportionment of representatives,
or raising the number of government appointed seats to exaggerate
the number of seats won by incumbents beyond voter preferences.
Hence, to deter citizens from cheating, governments from abusing
their policing and oversight authority, and political leaders from bias-
ing the system, societies need third-party institutions whose purpose
is to monitor both citizens and government actors and report on their
actions. Such institutions include an independent judiciary (discussed
above), legislative oversight committees, and a free press. “Together
they provide more reason for faith that commitments will be kept or, at
least, that transgressions will be discovered and punished” (Levi, 1997,
p. 23). Third-party organizations are insufficient, however, to promote
transparency and accountability. In addition, mobilizing organizations,
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 105
such as political parties and civil society organizations, are needed to
promote civic participation and ensure that citizens remain vigilant in
the struggle to articulate and protect their interests.
Improving Accountability and Mobilization
Media. There is near-universal recognition by practitioners that a
free media plays an important role in post-conflict peacebuilding and
is a crucial check on government authority (Brinkerhoff, Johnson, and
Hill, 2009, p. 37; Dobbins et al., 2007, pp. 202–207; USIP, 2009,
pp. 103 and 127). The media can act as a watchdog that promotes trans-
parency and accountability by exposing abuses of power, as a civic forum
that can inform voters and promote peaceful exchange among rivals,
and as an agenda setter that strengthens government responsiveness to
social issues (Norris, 2008, p. 189). The media’s independent impact on
governance issues is also well documented: In the Watergate scandal,
reporting by the Washington Post set into motion a series of disclosures
that led to President Nixon’s resignation, and studies in India show that
the government is more responsive to social needs in areas where news-
paper circulation and electoral accountability is highest (Besley and
Burgess, 2002). Given the argument’s intuitive sense and the strength
of supporting evidence, state-builders should be encouraged to pro-
mote a free press in tandem with other governance initiatives.
Cautions. And yet, while there is considerable evidence that a free
press is correlated with these peace- and democracy-supporting func-
tions, there is no clear consensus as to the direction of the relation-
ship or whether a similar correlation can be found in countries emerg-
ing from war. It may be that established democracies have the civil
rights protections and social values that allow the press to function in
a manner that reinforces peace and good governance. In less liberal
media environments, the press’s impact may be muted, and some stud-
ies have found that the media can exacerbate tensions in post-conflict
situations. Ethnic divisions were solidified and mobilized by media
sources prior to conflicts in Georgia and Rwanda (Ellis, 2006; Toup-
ouria, 2000).
To safeguard against the media undermining peacebuilding
efforts, Frohardt and Temin (2003) suggest a number of interventions.
106 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
To discourage partisanship, donor funding can be used to incentiv-
ize diversification of outlet ownership and of the journalist corps. To
improve journalists’ professionalism and capacity, media-support orga-
nizations, such as Internews and the Center for International Media
Assistance, can provide material assistance and training workshops.
Bringing journalists together can create an esprit de corps, and this
professional solidarity can enforce standards of rigor and objectivity
that supersede other personal group allegiances. To create a healthy
legal environment for a free press, legislation to protect journalists and
media outlets from government interference, as well as to protect indi-
viduals from media defamation or falsehoods, should be enacted. And,
finally, the media need to be consistently monitored for early warning
signs of impending conflict, such as hate speech and fearmongering, so
that actions can be taken early on to mitigate building tensions (Fro-
hardt and Temin, 2003, pp. 15–16).
Civil Society Organizations and Political Parties. While the press
can expose transgressions and highlight problems, it does not directly
hold the government accountable. That responsibility falls to civic
organizations and political parties, which mobilize citizens and articu-
late their interests so that they can use mechanisms of accountability—
typically elections, but also demonstrations, boycotts, and strikes—
to their advantage. Independently, citizens can have little effect on
bringing about change, and, as a result, they may have a propensity to
politically disengage. Civil society organizations and political parties
encourage engagement by acting as collective forums that offer citizens
an opportunity to amplify their voices. They can also mobilize citizens
by providing selective incentives (examples can range from camara-
derie to low-rate insurance) that offset the costs of civic action and by
instilling values that encourage political participation.
Civic organizations may be a necessary condition for accountable
government, but, as is the case with a free press, the direction of the
relationship remains unclear, especially in fragile societies. Most of the
assumptions about the role of civil society are based on examinations
of democracies (Putnam, 1993; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady, 1995),
where parties and associations are autonomous from the government
and “channels of political participation are guaranteed” (Jamal, 2007,
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 107
p. 7). Yet in less liberal or underdeveloped societies, the opportuni-
ties to link citizens to governments are shaped by the existing political
system. If, for example, a society has strong patron-client networks,
organizations will tend to reinforce those patterns. Rather than mobi-
lize collective action or hold politicians accountable, civic organiza-
tions in clientelist societies tend to reinforce politicians’ superior posi-
tion by encouraging members to seek private benefits (jobs, housing,
etc.) through informal channels. These organizations work within the
system to make their members materially “better off,” but in doing
so they maintain their subordinate relationship to the government. If,
however, civic organizations and opposition parties are denied both
formal and informal mechanisms for pressuring the government, they
may seek to overthrow the system (Jamal, 2007, p. 9). In both cases,
civic organizations and parties serve to mobilize citizens but do not
foster democratic values or accountability. Given that mobilizing orga-
nizations tend to reinforce the political systems they operate within,
bottom-up approaches to democracy promotion and state-building are
unlikely to work unless a political structure is already in place that has
accessible channels for political participation and accountability.
Conclusion
This survey of the literature on governance and political development
reveals that no factor is more important to the success of S&R than
an understanding of the domestic context. Without it, one cannot not
know the potential costs of partition, a country’s capacity to man judi-
cial institutions and enact the rule of law, or other information essential
to making state-building choices. This conclusion may seem evasive,
but it is fundamental; further, it has important concrete implications
for action. In dealing with a stabilization and reconstruction challenge,
substantial resources should be committed early to acquiring (1) an
understanding of the country’s human, economic, and cultural make-
up; (2) a history of the sources of contention behind the conflict; (3) an
understanding of the capacities and objectives of combatant groups;
(4) expertise on state-building options for the particular country; and

(5) a realistic assessment of the nation-builder’s own commitment and
capabilities. In combination, this information defines the choice set
within which nation-builders must operate if they are to be successful.
Although no generic formulas exist for creating a functioning and
thriving political system, both because of contextual differences and
the numerous institutional combinations that can combine for success,
there is a broad consensus on a framework of political goals for post-
conflict state-building. These political goals include
1. the dispersal of benefits
2. shared decisionmaking
3. barriers to overcentralization and exclusion
4. a self-enforcing system of accountability and responsiveness.
To dissuade former or potential combatants from returning to
conflict, the benefits of peace must outweigh the benefits of war. Even
if the costs of returning to conflict are raised, forming a sustainable
government will likely require benefits to former and potential combat-
ants. Benefits that address the original source of conflict will probably
be the most persuasive. These may include positions of power, inde-
pendent access to resources, some form of autonomy, veto power, or
certain rights.
Shared decisionmaking is more than just a perk for ceasing hostili-
ties. A broad consensus is often needed in post-conflict decisionmaking
because the peace is so fragile that even the slightest increase in per-
ceived threat can tip the balance in favor of conflict. Though shared
decisionmaking is often recommended, the level and definition vary
significantly among scholars and cases, ranging from parties having a
voice in the decisionmaking process to strict consensus rules that force
mutual agreement. Shared decisionmaking can be fostered by way of
coalition cabinets that share executive powers, seat quotas, high vote
thresholds, veto powers, and a wide assortment of procedural rules.
General consensus also exists among scholars that combatants
are unlikely to surrender their weapons unless there are structures in
place to protect them from exclusion and retribution. Separation of
powers, proportional representation, federalism, and independent judi-
Establishing Favorable Political Conditions 109
ciaries all help reassure groups that are out of, or exiting, positions of
power. Even if former combatants face setbacks in political competi-
tions, these barriers help assure them that prospects for making future
gains will remain open.
Finally, nearly all state-building experts agree on the political goal
of establishing a system of accountability that binds citizens and the
state (the reason that democracy is so frequently assumed to be the best
form of government). Unlike other regime types, democracy is based
on a self-enforcement mechanism that allows citizens to hold leaders
accountable if they do not respond to their interests. Some democratic
institutions, of course, enhance accountability more than others. For
example, open-list electoral ballots allow voters to hold individual poli-
ticians accountable for their actions, whereas closed-list ballots restrict
accountability to the party level. Fear of removal creates a strong incen-
tive for better governance, but another reason that open-list ballots
improve responsiveness is that by reflecting citizens’ opinions about
specific lawmakers they provide more accurate information about
how voters want to be governed. Fiscal federalism is also thought to
improve accountability. The control over government revenues that
comes with fiscal federalism helps local politicians spread patronage
and enact policies that serve their constituencies, both of which help
them get reelected. When local governments have the power to tax,
and corporations and individuals have the freedom to move, politi-
cians want to ensure that sources of revenue do not leave their district.
Competition among districts prompts politicians to enact reforms and
provide incentives to attract tax dollars (Weingast, 1995). A system of
accountability is especially important for post-conflict state-building
because, without accountability, post-conflict regimes are susceptible
to evolving into static oligarchies that may operate according to nomi-
nally democratic rules but in reality serve the interests of power-brokers
instead of citizens.

1 As with studies on civil society, the direction of the causal relationship between
these outcomes and women’s education levels is a subject of considerable debate.
2 In 1993, a United Nations panel of experts defined ethnic cleansing to be the
“planned and deliberate removal from a specific territory, [of] persons of a particular
ethnic group by force or intimidation, in order to render the area ethnically homo-
geneous” (Carmichael, 2002, p. 2).
3 In consolidated authoritarian regimes, governing authority is concentrated in
the hands of an individual or a small group of people who exercise power with few
institutional constraints. The distribution of power is uncontested by prominent
elite groups in the society (e.g., the business class, military, religious establishment,
etc.), even though this is often the result of coercion or suppression.
4 We use the minimalist definition of consolidated democracy employed by Linz
and Stepan (1996, p. 14): A consolidated democracy is “a political regime in which
democracy as a complex system of institutions, rules, and patterned incentives and
disincentives has become, in a phrase, ‘the only game in town.’” When a democracy
is consolidated, the population believes that elected officials are legitimate, and citi-
zens engage the political system.
5 In his seminal work, The Anatomy of Revolution (1938), Crane Brinton articulates
his concept of “the desertion of the intellectuals.” Intellectuals often play the role
of a society’s moral compass. Brinton found that just prior to revolutions in Britain,
America, Russia, and France, intellectuals—feeling socially alienated due to govern-
ment actions—began to declare the government immoral and undeserving of the
public’s assent. Many of them sought refuge abroad. Scholars note similar patterns
in revolutionary movements in China (Meisner, 1999), Iran (Boroujerdi, 1996), and
Romania (Siani-Davies, 2005).
6 Bellin (2004) notes that oil-rich states are also more authoritarian because they
can afford strong coercive apparatuses.

CHAPTER FOUR
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and
Reconstruction
Stephen Watts
Introduction
Purpose
This chapter builds on the previous one, by Julie Taylor, about estab-
lishing favorable political conditions in stabilization and reconstruction
(S&R). This chapter is a much-elaborated discussion of a few selected
political dilemmas that routinely arise. Also, it takes the next step of
suggesting ways to resolve, or at least mitigate, those dilemmas.
Overview
The U.S.-led interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq have profoundly
influenced policy debates over when interventions should occur and
what constitute appropriate ends and means. The international ortho-
doxy for repairing weak and failed states that prevailed in the wake of
the Cold War called for transforming civil wars into nonviolent politi-
cal conflicts through the creation of strong and inclusive formal gov-
ernmental institutions, above all democratic ones, capable of redressing
the grievances of formerly oppressed populations. Although this ortho-
doxy had its critics, and many argued that the international commu-
nity’s commitment to democracy promotion was more rhetorical than
real, it nonetheless shaped international actions in countries as diverse
as El Salvador, Cambodia, Mozambique, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, and
Timor-Leste.1 Disappointments from many of these operations have
combined with the criticism of U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq
to fuel a new approach to interventions. This new approach empha-
126 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
sizes modest ends: a minimal conception of S&R focused more on
stabilization (the end of large-scale violence) than on democratic trans-
formation. Stabilization is to be accomplished primarily through the
establishment of effective local governance—security above all, but the
intent is also to provide such public services as education and public
health.
The specifics of these policy debates have changed over time, but
they ultimately have revolved around three central dilemmas (the third
stemming from the first two):
1. Inclusion. Is it better for the government to co-opt challengers to
the current regime and risk divisiveness within the government,
or to exclude them and risk escalating spirals of violence?
2. State Capacity. Is S&R better served by strengthening the state
and extending its powers further into aspects of social relations,
or by relying on indirect and decentralized forms of governance?
3. Transition. Should intervenors pay the costs and accept the
risks up-front for a form of government that will address the
“root causes” of violence and be sustainable in the long term?
Or should they accept a more easily achievable form of govern-
ment in the short run for the sake of immediate peace, while
hoping that gradual evolution to better institutions is possible
with time (or even that gradualism would make that evolution
more feasible)?
These three dilemmas have prompted furious debate for decades.
No solution can fully resolve them, but we may hope to identify ways
of navigating them. This chapter first grounds the contemporary policy
debate in a historical context. It then examines the three dilemmas in
turn, demonstrating that they are “true” dilemmas in the sense that
they inevitably impose painful choices on would-be state-builders. The
chapter concludes by proposing a few rules of thumb for coping with
these dilemmas.
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 127
Debating Stabilization and Reconstruction
The challenges posed by instability and violence in weakly governed
regions are not new; they are recognizable in policy debates since the
era of decolonization, if not before. In many cases, instability prompts
little response from foreign governments, but the external repercus-
sions of “internal conflict” are sometimes enough to trigger military
intervention. During the Cold War, the United States feared Soviet
exploitation of instability. Since the end of the Cold War, civil wars
have commonly resulted in spillover violence, massive refugee flows,
economic disruptions, transnational crime, pandemic disease, and—of
particular concern since 2001—transnational terrorism (Collier et al.,
2003).
Although any attempt to group diverse policy positions
into a smaller number of “camps” risks simplifying—and even
mischaracterizing—specific arguments, it is useful to discern schools
of thought on military interventions that have been dominant in dif-
ferent periods of American foreign policy over the past several decades.
Three approaches in particular stand out: “controlled state-building,”
“liberal democratic state-building,” and “decentralized S&R” (summa-
rized in Table 4.1).
Controlled State-Building
During the early years of the Cold War, American policymakers focused
on Europe and Northeast Asia (particularly Japan) and on deterring
cross-border aggression. With such exceptions as Greece and the Phil-
ippines, where American military forces were not a principal actor, the
United States did not focus on “internal wars” until the 1960s. 2
The rise of American involvement in counterinsurgency from
the 1960s onward coincided with the development of “moderniza-
tion theory” in the American social-science community (Shafer, 1988).
Classic works by Walt Rostow (Rostow, 1960) and Samuel Huntington
(Huntington, 1968) provided much of the intellectual background for
U.S. counterinsurgency policy.3
Modernization theory emphasizes the reciprocal relationships
among economic, political, and cultural development. According to
128 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
the version of modernization theory popular in the 1960s, economic
growth propelled changes in the other spheres. In the process of mod-
ernization, economic growth (and the related processes of industrial-
ization and urbanization) began to break down traditional authority
structures and economic relationships founded on small rural commu-
nities and extended kinship groupings, such as clans and tribes. Ideally
these traditional forms of social order would be replaced by function-
ing markets and strong state institutions, substituting institutionalized
social support networks appropriate to the scale of modern economies
for the outmoded social protections offered by kinship.
Unfortunately, political modernization often did not keep pace
with changes in the economy, leading to violence and instability, as
in Iran. Two factors in particular prevented smooth transitions. First,
economic development frequently disrupted traditional communi-
ties without providing enough economic surplus to alleviate discon-

tent. Economic growth, in other words, failed to keep pace with the
demands of a population that was fast losing its traditional sources of
livelihood and protection in the event of adversity. Second, a power-
ful state with functioning political institutions often did not develop
quickly enough to respond effectively to the political demands of the
mobilized population. Without a strong state capable of responding to
political demands in productive ways, the population was likely to be
mobilized to violence and the overthrow of the regime.
Modernization theory suggested two policy responses to vio-
lence and the threat of Communist insurgency. First, rapid eco-
nomic development—best accomplished through capitalist market
structures—was critical. Second, state institutions must be strength-
ened before they could effectively accommodate popular political
demands (see especially Huntington, 1968). Taken together, these two
requirements implied a process of “controlled state-building,” in which
market-based economic development and the forging of a strong state
apparatus must precede democratization. Although democracy was the
long-term goal espoused by American policymakers, in the short-to-
medium term they were typically willing to manage the process of
modernization in such a way as to exclude political organizations and
demands that they viewed as threatening to the modernization process
and to postpone liberalization in the face of violent challenges to the
state (Kirkpatrick, 1979).
In practice, however, the United States found it difficult to manage
political change as prescribed by modernization theorists. First, local
rulers proved adept at resisting demands for political reforms, thereby
hindering the economic growth and partial political accommodation
that was intended to substitute for raw repression in the management of
political violence. Where rulers were indeed committed to reform, such
as with Ramon Magsaysay in the Philippines, there was seldom need
for substantial U.S. assistance, and where rulers were not committed to
reform (as in South Vietnam), no amount of U.S. assistance appeared
to help (Blaufarb, 1977). Second, by the 1980s American domestic
political opposition made it difficult to continue military support for
autocrats without insisting on democratic reforms, as in the case of
congressional opposition to military aid for El Salvador (Peceny, 1995).
130 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Liberal Democratic State-Building
The “third wave” of democratic revolutions from 1964–1990 com-
bined with the end of the Cold War to produce a radically altered
strategic landscape and perspectives on military intervention.4 The
primary factor prompting U.S. concern in the immediate post–Cold
War era shifted from the threat of Communist subversion to what is
known among social scientists as the “security externalities” of domes-
tic instability: the costs—such as refugee flows, the spread of disease,
the expansion of transnational organized crime, and terrorism—that
are shifted from the failing state onto its neighbors and the interna-
tional community more generally.
This period has often been characterized (fairly or not) as an era
of “democratic triumphalism,” typified by such works as Frances Fuku-
yama’s The End of History and the Last Man (1992). Liberal democratic
institutions were prescribed by many social scientists as the solution for
problems ranging from economic stagnation to famines, corruption,
the violation of human rights, and especially war (see Halperin, Siegle,
and Weinstein, 2005, for an overview of these arguments).
Liberal democracy played a critical role in social-science theoriz-
ing about strategies for restoring peace to weak and failed states rent by
violence. Ideally, the transition from civil war to democracy substitutes
electoral competition for contests of destruction.5 According to this
line of thinking, civil wars and insurgencies are motivated by inequita-
ble access to political power and the distribution of resources that flows
from control of the state (e.g., UNDP, 2009, p. 3). Autocratic regimes
spark rebellions because they use state resources to benefit a narrow
portion of the population at the expense of other groups. Democratic
competition for office should allow groups to press their demands on
the state through peaceful channels rather than having to bear the dev-
astations of war. Thus, the parties to conflict should be able to agree
on a settlement that offers credible promises of political inclusion to all
of the warring parties. Political inclusion played a major role in ending
many of the civil wars that came to an end in conjunction with the
end of the Cold War, such as those in El Salvador, Mozambique, and
Nicaragua.
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 131
Obviously, military potential and electoral potential are not iden-
tical, so the agreement of militarily powerful but politically weak fac-
tions may have to be “bought” through disproportionate concessions,
such as those made to the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, minority groups might be permanently excluded from power
in a purely majoritarian democracy, so some form of credible pro-
tections would have to be offered to these groups to convince them
to accept democratic governance. An extreme example is the radical
devolution of power to the “entity” level of government in Bosnia that
was necessary to secure the acquiescence of the Bosnian Serbs to the
Dayton Accords. A more moderate example is visible in post-Franco
Spain, where federalism was used to assuage regional minorities’ fears.
Both of these challenges can, at least in theory, be resolved through
power-sharing institutions that guarantee all parties to a conflict a rea-
sonable opportunity to participate in future governance. Such systems
of power-sharing should be easily recognizable to American observers;
the U.S. Constitution is itself an elaborate system of checks and bal-
ances designed to prevent any one faction from gaining absolute con-
trol of government.
The belief that democracy could help to bring peace to war-torn
societies—the liberal democratic state-building model—pervaded
official thinking and became the basis for peacekeeping doctrine in
the 1990s (see, for instance, Boutros-Ghali, 1992). The United States
espoused a grand strategy of “democratic enlargement” to replace
containment in the wake of the Cold War. The European Union also
increased its support for democracy promotion in this period, provid-
ing slightly more funding for such initiatives than the United States
(Carothers, 2004, p. 260). Then–Secretary-General of the United
Nations Boutros Boutros-Ghali made democracy promotion a center-
piece of UN strategy with his An Agenda for Democratization (1996)—a
commitment carried forward by his successor, Kofi Annan. Elections
were a cornerstone of international peacebuilding efforts in El Salva-
dor, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Namibia, Mozambique, Angola, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste, and elsewhere.
Much of the public rhetoric at the height of “democratic triumph-
alism” obscured the fact that many public officials and academics were
132 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
much more sober in their assessments of what democracy could realis-
tically accomplish in post-conflict environments. Even proponents of
democracy were divided as to the pace at which democratization could
realistically occur, the problems that democracy could be expected to
ameliorate in the near-to-medium term, and the likely congruence of
local practices with international human rights standards. Critics of
democratization policies went a step further, making two claims in
particular. First, democratization in such settings was highly unlikely
to succeed and could even exacerbate intercommunal tensions. Second,
even if democratization might ultimately be the best means to resolve
the root causes of conflict, outsiders could do relatively little to facili-
tate the transition through any means short of enormous and lengthy
military occupations.6 Such acknowledgements of the limitations of
democracy promotion in weak and failed states increased sharply as a
result of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.
Decentralized Stabilization and Reconstruction
The limitations and outright failures of U.S. policy in Afghanistan and
Iraq prompted a new wave of scholarship on the appropriate ends and
means of military intervention. As with any attempt to characterize
a strand of thinking, generalizations are difficult. Its proponents fre-
quently disagree on specifics, and they are usually the first to empha-
size that no uniform strategy can be applied across different contexts.
Nonetheless, a number of commonalities are clear. Proponents of the
new strategic thinking have focused on much more limited aims than
those that prevailed in the 1990s. In particular, its advocates support
stabilization (the absence of large-scale violence) over more transforma-
tive S&R agendas, such as democratization or the redress of grievances.
To the extent that justice or political representation features in decen-
tralized S&R strategies, the focus is on limiting government abuses of
the population rather than righting broader wrongs. Many thinkers in
this camp emphasize traditional conceptions of authority and legiti-
macy: Where restoration of political life before the start of large-scale
violence is possible, the status quo ante is often the goal. (Of course,
in many developing societies—especially countries such as Afghani-
stan and Somalia—the status quo ante was itself characterized by an

Trinkunas, 2010; and Herbst, 2000). The primary tool of stabilization
is effective local governance, particularly the provision of security and
other public services. While a strong central state might be desirable
in the longer term, short-term expansive central state-building efforts
are typically considered disastrous by proponents of this approach.7 We
may therefore refer to proponents of this line of thinking as proponents
of “decentralized stabilization and reconstruction.”
Because American soldiers have had to bear the price of policy
shortcomings in Afghanistan and Iraq, it is unsurprising that the advo-
cates of this approach include many from the U.S. military or associ-
ated with it. 8 Perhaps more surprising, many aspects of U.S. military
thinking parallel debates within the development community and the
evolution of academic debates on the causes of and policy prescriptions
for insurgencies and civil wars. The academic political science literature
has increasingly turned from state-level determinants of civil wars to
local dynamics, a reorientation perhaps best captured by Stathis Kaly-
vas (2006). Moreover, the reaction against transformative agendas in
Iraq combined with a pessimism born of the shortcomings of many
peace operations to strengthen the social-science scholarship on the
limitations and perverse outcomes of democracy promotion in deeply
divided societies. Increasingly scholars have emphasized the need for
indigenously initiated alternatives.9
Dimensions of the Debate
Despite varied strategic circumstances over the decades, debates over
the ends and means of interventions consistently return to a few recur-
ring questions. Two in particular stand out: (1) Is it better to co-opt
challengers to the state and form an inclusive government, or is it better
to form a cohesive but narrower ruling coalition? (2) Is it better for for-
eign intervenors to assist local actors in building a strong state, capable
of providing a high level of public goods (such as security and state
services), or is it better to rely on a wider range of actors both within
and outside of the state to provide more decentralized—and typically
more traditional or informal—governance? The answers to these two
134 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
questions shape the strategies that the United States and other foreign
actors will pursue, as shown in Figure 4.1.
The “controlled state-building” paradigm dominant in the 1960s
emphasizes strong central states but with lower levels of political inclu-
sion (at least in the short-to-medium term). The “liberal democratic
state-building” perspective that guided the peace operations of the
1990s and early 2000s seeks to promote a strong state, but one bound
by liberal institutions of political inclusion and participation. And the
“decentralized S&R” strategies coming to the fore in many of today’s
policy debates emphasize meeting the needs of the entire population,
but doing so through more informal and localized institutions of gov-
ernance. The fourth logical possibility (narrow inclusion combined
with decentralized governance) corresponds to the historical practice
of feudalism. Although it is a path to state-building that was prac-
ticed with great frequency throughout the centuries, it is hard to iden-
tify a single international intervention in the post-colonial era that has
adopted such an approach. It is therefore not included as an interna-
tional S&R strategy.
Any attempt to narrow debates to a few critical questions and
schools of thought sacrifices nuance. The horizontal and vertical axes
in Figure 4.1 thus represent degrees of difference, not clear black-and-
white distinctions. Proponents of controlled state-building often favor

political inclusion of moderate opponents of a regime, liberal demo-
cratic state-builders have commonly also advocated decentralization
of formal governmental institutions (while still attempting to build a
modern, Weberian state), and many advocates of decentralized S&R
support creation of a strong state security sector. Nonetheless, this
summary helps focus attention on the critical dilemmas, which are
discussed more fully below.
Dilemmas of Intervention
The ebb and flow of policy debates about ends and means for S&R are
shaped, naturally, by recent events. Problems encountered in Afghani-
stan and Iraq have prompted useful introspection and reassessment,
but it remains unclear what balance should be struck between the co-
optation or exclusion of regime challengers (often called “spoilers”)
(Stedman, 1996). Nor has social-science research established the opti-
mal mix of formal governmental institutions and decentralized societal
mechanisms of governance. Rather, these debates reflect underlying
dilemmas.
This section outlines the logic of the dilemmas of inclusion and
state capacity. Interestingly, many advocates of both controlled state-
building and decentralized S&R profess to support a liberal, institu-
tionalized political order as their eventual end goal. In many ways,
however, the early actions of intervenors commit them to particular
compromises and institutions from which it is difficult to evolve. The
challenges to gradual transition, then, constitute a third dilemma.
When posed starkly, all of these are truly dilemmas, posing a
choice between two comparably unpalatable alternatives. There is heu-
ristic value in stating them so bluntly so as to recognize the critical
choices and inevitable trade-offs inherent in S&R operations. None-
theless, this is only a starting point for analysis, since there may be
policy prescriptions that would at least mitigate the negative effects or
improve the positive payoffs of the choices made. Some such possibili-
ties are discussed later in this chapter. What follows elaborates on the
dilemmas themselves.
136 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
The Dilemmas of Inclusion
The principal dividing line of the policy debates over the civil wars of
the 1990s was between those who advocated negotiated solutions and
those who said it was necessary to allow the military victor to impose
a new political order (or to “give war a chance” in Luttwak’s [1999]
provocative formulation). The turn to counterinsurgency in the 2000s
has changed the stakes and some of the dynamics of the debate, but
the underlying issues remain the same. The debate revolves around a
central dilemma:
The Inclusion Dilemma. Military victory appears to be associ-
ated with more durable post-conflict political orders, but these
orders tend to be autocratic and repressive. Negotiated solutions
tend to generate more fragile political orders, but they tend to
be more politically inclusive—sometimes even democratic—
and less repressive. The inclusion dilemma, therefore, apparently
presents intervenors with a stark choice between either helping
to broker a negotiated and more politically inclusive—but also
highly fragile—end to a war or allowing one side to impose a
relatively more stable—but also more autocratic and repressive—
political order.
Analytically, war termination and political inclusion can be
understood as two distinct processes, albeit closely interlinked. Civil
wars or insurgencies erupt when factions capable of large-scale violence
disagree on the appropriate political order for their state. These con-
flicts end when the parties reach agreement about the relative costs
of fighting and benefits of a particular post-conflict political order.10
Outside intervenors can influence the local parties’ calculations—for
instance, by decreasing the odds of victory (e.g., by intervening against
one of the parties) or by making a political settlement more attractive
(e.g., by providing economic aid or security guarantees to any party
that agrees to the settlement). But even when a country like the United
States intervenes, results from the battlefield still affect the ensuing
political order. Before committing to an intervention and a particular
S&R strategy, therefore, it is critical to understand the interrelationship
between military outcomes and political inclusion.
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 137
Military Victory and the Benefits of Political Exclusion. The so-
called realist perspective emphasizes that state-making has historically
been a product of war-making (Tilly, 1999; Weinstein, 2005). While
the humanitarian impulse may be to end a war as quickly as possible,
some scholars argue that humanitarianism is in fact poorly served by
such an approach. Ironically, the powerful states that now intervene
elsewhere and seek to impose negotiated solutions ended their own
internal struggles with clear-cut winners, as occurred in the American
Civil War.
The process of waging war and the fact of decisive defeat facilitate
the construction of stable regimes in a number of ways. First, accord-
ing to this perspective, war-making is a form of state-making. To defeat
opponents throughout the territory of a country, a faction leader must
build relatively broad bases of support and develop a strong organiza-
tional structure—in other words, the foundations of a cohesive state.11
Yoweri Museveni and his victorious National Resistance Movement
(NRM), for instance, led Uganda from the depths of its conflicts in the
1960s and 1980s (when the country’s name was almost synonymous
with violent atrocities) to become one of the foremost examples of post-
conflict recovery (Weinstein, 2005). Second, because a single faction or
united coalition has triumphed, it can govern in a relatively coherent
and decisive manner, rather than being incessantly forced to “buy off”
opposition and make unsustainable compromises. Here it is possible
to contrast the divergent post-conflict trajectories of Croatia, which
defeated Serbian paramilitaries and has become a prosperous and
democratic state, with Bosnia, which was forced to accept a military
stalemate and has been mired in political near-paralysis since. Third,
because opposing forces have been decisively defeated, the balance of
power and the costs of renewed conflict are clear; a group that has suf-
fered the consequences of military defeat is unlikely to seek renewed
conflict—at least, not soon (Werner and Yuen, 2005).
Although there is significant debate (discussed below and in Chap-
ter Two of this volume), a number of statistical studies of civil wars over
the past century have seemed to support the idea that war-making and
decisive defeat of rivals is an essential aspect of state-making. They have
concluded that negotiated settlements are much more likely to degen-
138 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
erate into renewed fighting than are civil wars that end in military
victory (Licklider, 1995; Toft, 2010; Werner and Yuen, 2005); indeed,
Fortna (2004, p. 273) writes, “That peace is more stable after decisive
military victories than after wars that end in a tie is perhaps the most
consistent finding of the literature on the durability of peace after both
civil and interstate conflict.” From these studies, by themselves, the
policy implication might seem clear: To end a war quickly, intervene
decisively in favor of one of the protagonists, typically the government
(Regan, 1996).
Critics of such an approach, however, point to problems with this
argument: (1) the difficulty of achieving decisive military defeat, (2) the
potential of external intervenors to decisively change the dynamics of
post-conflict stabilization, and (3) the costs of military victory and
political exclusion. Nor is the statistical evidence in favor of military vic
tory as robust as its proponents claim; recent scholars have found signifi-
cant shortcomings in the claimed relationship between military victory
and durable peace (Doyle and Sambanis, 2006, p. 104). Consequently,
proponents of political inclusion argue for negotiated settlements to
civil wars and power-sharing arrangements that transform violent con-
flicts into peaceful political contestation.12
The first problem encountered by the “give war a chance” camp is
the difficulty of achieving decisive military victory. The average dura-
tion of civil wars has increased from approximately two years in 1946 to
fifteen years in 1999 (Fearon and Laitin, 2003, p. 68). Toft (2010, p. 8)
argues that “the combination of the proliferation of weak states, refine-
ments in insurgency strategy, and the wide distribution of small arms
has made it relatively more difficult for even well-supplied and well-led
combatants to achieve victory.” As a war continues, the devastation
mounts, destroying physical infrastructure, contributing to declines in
public health that endure for years after the conflict, and causing the
educated elite to flee and settle in more-developed countries. The over-
all process is a case of “development in reverse,” leaving the country
permanently weakened and thus at higher risk of renewed conflict—a
phenomenon a World Bank report referred to as the “conflict trap”
(Collier et al., 2003). Decisive victory has been elusive in countries
ranging from Somalia to Afghanistan to the Democratic Republic
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 139
of Congo. Even when it is achieved, as it apparently has been in Sri
Lanka, the costs of decades of conflict can be enormous.
Second, while negotiated settlements themselves may be highly
fragile, the presence of external intervenors can radically improve their
chances of enduring (Doyle and Sambanis, 2000, 2006; Fortna, 2004,
2008; Walter, 1999, 2002).
Third, military victory is frequently purchased at the price of vio-
lent repression and sometimes even genocide. While Licklider (1995)
finds that negotiated settlements are less stable than military victories,
he also finds that one-fifth of identity (e.g., ethnic or sectarian) con-
flicts ending in military victory precipitate genocides, while not a single
case of negotiated settlement has done so. Moreover, military victo-
ries are much more likely to result in authoritarian governments than
are negotiated settlements (Gurses and Mason, 2008; Watts, 2009).
Authoritarianism, in turn, is generally associated with a violent repres-
sion and even genocide (Rummel, 1995), particularly in the aftermath
of civil war or other violent conflict (Harff, 2003). The atrocities of the
victorious Khmer Rouge in Cambodia or the Indonesian military in
East Timor are but two examples.
Finally, beyond the realities “on the ground,” there are the reali-
ties of American domestic politics. At least under some circumstances,
large parts of the American public (and European publics) have been
unwilling to see unrestrained warfare take its course in countries rang-
ing from Somalia to Bosnia and elsewhere. The intensity of this human-
itarian sentiment and the extent to which government decisionmakers
should be guided by these considerations is open to debate. At a mini-
mum, however, public opinion poses a constraint on the most nakedly
realpolitik options.
Negotiating Political Inclusion. Critics of the “give war a chance”
school commonly claim that there is no such thing as a purely military
victory. Even if a party (or coalition of parties) is capable of winning on
the battlefield, it typically sows the seeds of its eventual downfall. The
personalities and skills of the successful warlord are seldom the same
as those of the gifted political leader. Asking a militia commander to
submit to the rule of law “may be like asking a champion swimmer to
empty the pool” (Collier et al., 2003, p. 82). Moreover, in the absence
140 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
of an organized and powerful opposition, rulers seldom if ever feel
compelled to offer meaningful opportunities for political participation
to those outside of their support base (Olson, 1993; Przeworski, 1991;
Rustow, 1970). Consequently, military victory in a civil war—whether
on the part of the government or insurgents—typically results in the
political exclusion of large parts of a country’s population. Such exclu-
sion, in turn, sets the stage for future conflict (see, for instance, Gurr,
2000, 2002).
Proponents of political inclusion argue that durable peace requires
giving all major actors a stake in continued peaceful relations. If all
actors are given access to an equitable proportion of both political and
economic assets, then they all have an interest in retaining the system.
Negotiated settlements based on political inclusion should make it pos-
sible both to end wars more quickly and to create the foundations for a
more stable peace in the long term.
Two challenges to this approach immediately arise. First, it is dif-
ficult to determine what an “equitable proportion” of a state’s assets are,
and even more difficult to arrange the compromise in such a manner as
to permit effective government. Second, even if a suitable compromise
could be found, it is difficult to ensure that all parties to an agreement
will stick to it in the future, especially if incentives for abiding by the
compromise change over time.
Peace treaties for civil wars distribute control or influence over
the state’s institutions in a manner acceptable to all factions (see also
discussion in Chapter Three). To induce the warring parties to accept
the compromise, control or influence may be distributed in propor-
tion to their fighting strength at the time of the peace treaty. Unfortu-
nately, such a power-sharing framework is problematic for two reasons.
First, unless the factions’ fighting strength and electoral strength are
equal, a compromise that is acceptable to the parties’ wartime lead-
ership will effectively underrepresent much of the population. Their
political marginalization sets the stage for future conflict. Second, the
guarantees and protections needed to induce all of the parties to sign a
power-sharing agreement are frequently so extreme as to make effective
governance extraordinarily difficult. Systems of mutual vetoes para-
lyze decisionmaking, and both budgets and staffing of the civil service
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 141
become bloated by earmarking. In practice, it is extremely difficult to
find a formula that divides power acceptably while still making effec-
tive government possible over time. In part for these reasons, power-
sharing regimes formed in the wake of civil wars have a dismal histori-
cal record (Rothchild and Roeder, 2005).
A second problem with using political inclusion to bring civil wars
and insurgencies to an end concerns the “time-inconsistency” problem
(see especially Fearon, 1998; Walter, 2002). Przeworski (1991, p. 25)
summarizes the problem succinctly when he writes that “The central
difficulty of political power in any form is that it gives rise to increas-
ing returns to scale.” Once one party (or coalition of parties) obtains
the upper hand in a post-conflict government, it is then in a position to
use its control of state institutions to add to its power. Ultimately the
governing party (or parties) may become powerful enough to repress
all rivals. At this point the factions are unlikely to feel constrained to
honor an agreement made under duress years ago. Thus, peace agree-
ments signed at one point in time become unenforceable later. Recog-
nizing this risk, warring factions either will not sign a peace deal or, if
they do, will secretly retain the means of returning to war to protect
themselves (a point discussed also in Chapter Two).
So long as a power-sharing agreement remains an oligopolistic
balance of power among the wartime-era factions, it is extremely dif-
ficult to resolve these tensions. When “political inclusion” means the
inclusion of only well-organized, well-armed factions who obtained
their position by force of arms, then these groups have little incen-
tive to normalize (demilitarize) politics. The public as a whole suffers
from the political deadlock and inefficiencies of power-sharing, but the
political elite may fare quite well. They typically collect “rents” from
their control of the state and commonly maintain control of the illicit
economies that sprang up during the course of the war, all the while
justifying the political instability and economic stagnation in the name
of protecting their constituent subpopulations from the possibility of
renewed warfare. Such dynamics have been clearly visible in Bosnia,
where stories abound of political leaders preventing the implementa-
tion of aid programs so as to keep voters radicalized.
142 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
The typical policy prescription for escaping this impasse is to
institute mechanisms of popular accountability, as discussed in Chap-
ter Three—that is, to empower the public to insist on improved per-
formance from office holders and sanction failure by removing under-
performing officials from office. Such a perspective is common in the
development community and among multilateral organizations such
as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): “By pro-
moting inclusive participation of all members of society, including
disadvantaged and marginalized groups, and by helping to build up
responsive governing institutions and respect for human rights, it is
possible to mitigate conflict and promote peace” (UNDP, 2009, p. xi).
To introduce formal institutions of popular accountability to a system
of broad political inclusion, however, is to create a form of democratic
governance. And here we stumble on all of the problems inherent in
ambitious projects of democratization in post-conflict environments.
After the initial period of “democratic triumphalism” following
the fall of the Berlin Wall, observers are now much more measured in
their assessments of when and how democratic institutions can con-
tribute positively to a country’s development. Many have warned about
the limited ability of foreigners to introduce and support systems of
democratic governance elsewhere and the often-dismal record of past
efforts (Carothers, 2004, pp. 60, 232; Ottaway, 2000; Pei and Kasper,
2003; Whitehead, 1986; Zuercher, 2006; but see Dunning, 2004;
Goldsmith, 2001; and Van de Walle, 2005, for contending views).
Even with democratic institutions in place, the evidence is mixed as
to how much they contribute to the quality of a government’s per-
formance or its responsiveness to its population. Thomas Carothers
(2002), for instance, warns about two common and enduring patterns
of low-quality democracy, what he labels “feckless pluralism” (where
parties alternate in power, but no party seems capable of effective or
responsive rule) and “dominant-power” quasi-democracy (in which a
single party is capable of ruling indefinitely without facing effective
electoral challengers). Perhaps most damning for the notion of demo-
cratic conflict resolution, many scholars caution that mature democra-
cies are the most stable and peaceful type of regime, but states that are
in the process of democratizing may be the most unstable and prone to
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 143
violence (see Bates, 2008, pp. 8–9; Goldstone et al., 2005; Hegre et al.,
2001; Mansfield and Snyder, 2002; Snyder, 2000). Those who fear the
destabilizing consequences of democratization tend to recommend an
extended period of state capacity-building and gradual liberalization
before democratization is attempted (see, for instance, Zakaria, 2003;
but see Chapter Three of this volume for skeptical comments). With
such proposals the policy debate has come full circle, with at least some
observers returning from the liberal state-building of the 1990s to the
controlled state-building of Samuel Huntington’s Political Order in
Changing Societies (1968) and other classics of the 1960s.
Assessing the Inclusion Debate. Although idealism and dogma-
tism undoubtedly played their roles, much of the international com-
munity’s incorporation of democratic elements into their strategies for
stabilization derived from more sober considerations—in particular,
frustrations with the limitations of both elite-based power-sharing and
the type of state-building associated with military victories. Decisive
victories might lay the foundations for a strong state, but they are dif-
ficult to achieve in the contemporary era—Sri Lanka is one of the very
few recent cases. Even if one faction emerges victorious, the state-build-
ing that occurs is likely to be autocratic, repressive, and possibly even
genocidal. To cite even a relatively mild example, the score-settling
that followed the Greek civil war distorted politics in that country for
three generations. Repressive governance, in turn, is associated with
refugee flows, the radicalization of oppressed minorities and diasporas,
and many of the other “security externalities” that the international
community has sought to limit in the past two decades. When diplo-
mats turned to more inclusive S&R strategies, however, such as power-
sharing arrangements, they found them typically difficult to broker,
ineffectual, inflexible, and fragile. Efforts to make power-sharing more
effective by incorporating formal mechanisms of popular accountabil-
ity foundered on the well-known limitations of democracy promotion
in weak and divided states.
Clearly the debate is too blunt, at least in the condensed form in
which it has been presented here. It is worth noting that even propo-
nents of state-making through military victory, such as Jeremy Wein-
stein (2005), offer numerous caveats and insist that it is an approach
144 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
advisable in only some circumstances. Similarly, most advocates of
democratic conflict resolution have been chastened by the disappoint-
ments of the past two decades and offer more limited and more nuanced
support for the concept than they once did. Moreover, when Ameri-
can decisionmakers consider how best to stabilize a war-torn region,
geopolitical considerations of national interest affect support for policy
options based on who is to be included or excluded—whether they are
Communists (during the Cold War), close allies of al Qaeda (in the
present era), or some other grouping that has objectives inimical to
those of American foreign policy. In the final section, such factors will
be explicitly taken into consideration as various policy prescriptions are
developed. Before turning to this discussion, however, it is important
to understand the other dimensions of the contemporary debate.
The Dilemma of State Capacity
Despite differences of opinion about the appropriate degree of politi-
cal inclusion and democratization in a strategy of stabilization, would-
be stabilizers throughout most of the past two decades have almost
universally agreed that establishing a strong, capable state is the best
way to restore peace and promote development in war-torn and chaotic
countries (Barakat, 2004, p. 16; Doyle and Sambanis, 2000, p. 680;
Fukuyama, 2004; Zuercher, 2006, p. 1). Typical of this approach is
the guidance issued by the World Bank (2005, p. v): “Erosion of state
capacity or accountability eventually results in failure to mediate com-
peting interests, generate economic growth or provide services in an
inclusive and accountable way, creating the space for political instabil-
ity or conflict.” From this perspective, the policy prescription is obvi-
ous: “A long-term focus on state capacity and accountability is critical
in all fragile state contexts if these countries are ever to find a durable
exit from crisis” (World Bank, 2005, p. 3).
Recently, however, many scholars and practitioners have pushed
back against the strong-state orthodoxy. Even in many middle-income
countries of Latin America the reach of the state is limited, and insti-
tutions of informal governance can be as effective, or even more so
in some circumstances, in mediating disputes and delivering public
services (Helmke and Levitsky, 2006). In low-income and extremely
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 145
impoverished countries, the state may be little more than an abstrac-
tion for most of the territory beyond the capital city. In large reaches
of Africa and in parts of Asia, such as Afghanistan, the state has never
approached the ideal of the Western state system (Clapham, 2004; Ellis,
2005; Englebert and Tull, 2008; Herbst, 1996, 2000; Jones, 2009).
Consequently, an increasingly intense debate has arisen between those
who believe in a strong state as the means to long-term stability and
development and those who believe that social structures and informal
institutions must realistically play a much greater role in the gover-
nance of many sectors in the less developed countries of the world.
The debate, in fact, reflects an underlying dilemma:
The Dilemma of State Capacity. Stated starkly, the dilemma
of state capacity suggests that intervenors may be able to create
a strong central state capable of efficient service provision and
defeating violent challenges to its authority, but typically only
at tremendous cost and a lengthy foreign commitment. Alter-
natively, intervenors can create more informal governance more
quickly and at much lower cost—but with corresponding weak-
nesses in the state’s ability to provide the services that both its
population and foreign powers would prefer.
Where the central state is weak—whether due to lack of resources,
runaway corruption, a historical tradition of weak central government,
or some combination of factors—the external powers conducting a sta-
bility operation have two basic options. They can attempt to strengthen
the central state, or they can work around it, by seeking to provide ser-
vices through nongovernmental organizations or empowering informal
institutions of governance, such as tribes (see also related discussion in
Chapter Seven). The former approach may be prohibitively lengthy and
expensive, and, in some regions without any history of strong state
institutions, it may simply be infeasible. Moreover, by attempting to
create such a state apparatus, foreigners may provoke a violent reac-
tion from the local population—what David Kilcullen (2009, p. 38)
describes in terms of “an immune response in which the body rejects
the intrusion of a foreign object.” On the other hand, without effec-
tive central state institutions, the partner state may be unable to foster
146 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
economic development, enforce the rule of law throughout its territory,
or mediate potentially violent disputes between local factions. Peace
based on such foundations is likely to be quite precarious. Even if peace
endures, it is not clear that the state will be able to resolve the under-
lying issues—such as refugee flows or the presence of violent trans-
national networks—that precipitated foreign intervention in the first
place.
The remainder of the section on the dilemma of state capacity
begins with some definitions, follows with a review of the strengths
and weaknesses of governance mechanisms, and ends with conclusions
about the debate.
The Nature and Scope of Governance. State capacity may be
defined as the ability of the state to provide such public goods as secu-
rity, infrastructure, and welfare services. More specifically, as former
Colombian Minister for Economic Development Mauricio Cardenas
observed in a recent paper (2010, p. 2), “much of the literature in the
social sciences uses the term to mean the professionalization of the state
bureaucracy, its ability to protect property rights and make credible
commitments to private investors, as well as its ability to raise revenue
from the society.”
State capacity, however, is only one element of the broader con-
cept of governance. Traditionally government refers to the formulation
and execution of the policies of the state. Governance, on the other
hand, has a much broader scope. The United Nations Development
Programme recently defined it to mean
the exercise of political, economic, and administrative authority
in the management of a country’s affairs at all levels. Governance
is a neutral concept comprising the complex mechanisms, pro-
cesses, relationships and institutions through which citizens and
groups articulate their interests, exercise their rights and obliga-
tions and mediate their differences. (UNDP, 2009, p. 2)
The concept of governance thus includes both formal and infor-
mal institutions.
Informal institutions in turn may be defined as “socially shared
rules, usually unwritten, that are created, communicated, and enforced
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 147
outside officially sanctioned channels” (Helmke and Levitsky, 2006,
p. 5). Informal institutions of governance may include tribal courts or
councils of elders, patronage networks or “political machines,” networks
of merchants self-organized to enforce private contracts, and “informal
police,” such as tribal militias or vigilante gangs. Informal institutions
are ubiquitous in all societies. In countries where stability operations
typically occur, however, these institutions differ in degree and often in
kind from those found in most developed societies. Because the formal
state is usually much weaker in developing societies, informal institu-
tions necessarily have a more pervasive role in regulating social behav-
ior. While informal institutions may be effective in regulating social
behavior, however, they may not conform to international principles
of human and civil rights. And while states can be pressured to accept
such standards, autonomous social networks are difficult to regulate.
Informal institutions depend on three requirements to func-
tion effectively (Dixit, 2004; Engerman and Sokoloff, 2008, p. 129;
Haggard, MacIntyre, and Tiede, 2008, p. 220; Helmke and Levitsky,
2006; Lyon and Porter, 2009). First, they require a commonly under-
stood (although usually unwritten) code of conduct. Informal insti-
tutions typically arise within ethnic groups or co-religionists because
they can “draw on a reservoir of common cultural material—language,
experience, understanding about modes of interaction—that makes it
easier for community members to communicate and work together”
(Habyarimana et al., 2007, p. 711). Second, they depend on a mecha-
nism for obtaining reliable information about the actions (and espe-
cially transgressions) of others within the network. In the absence of
more formalized institutions of monitoring (such as government regu-
lators or a well-developed and free media), information is normally
obtained through face-to-face relationships and the development of
long-standing relationships and reputations within a given community,
whether it be an extended family, a rural village, a network of traders, a
secret religious society, or some other grouping. Finally, informal insti-
tutions require an enforcement mechanism to punish those who vio-
late the commonly understood rules. Enforcement mechanisms vary
considerably. They may be violent, as in the case of Russian organized
criminal gangs who enforce order within a given locality or economic
148 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
sector (see, for instance, Volkov, 2000), or militias formed from tribes
or secret societies, such as the Arbakai of Afghanistan or the Kamajors
of Sierra Leone, or private police forces hired by merchants to ensure
the safety and reliability of markets in places such as Nigeria and
Somalia (Lyon and Porter, 2009; Mubarak, 1996). But often enforce-
ment mechanisms are much subtler: the loss of reputation or social
shaming and stigmatizing, either of which can carry serious material as
well as social consequences in societies based on community and trust
(Helmke and Levitsky, 2006; Lyon and Porter, 2009, p. 906).
Strengths of Informal Institutions. The preceding discussion
has already indicated many of the strengths of informal institutions.
Unlike many grandiose state-building projects, informal institutions
are closely adapted to local realities because they evolve from the fabric
of everyday interactions (Scott, 1998). Drawing on existing networks
and practices, they are inexpensive and immediately available; they do
not require extensive training, new facilities, or salaried employees.
They are usually strong and resilient: Whereas state institutions may be
an abstraction for much of the population, neighbors and families are
real and present, and religious or other norms are internalized. Where
states fail, informal institutions typically take over the functions of
governance.
States impose a more or less uniform set of institutions across often
highly diverse societies, resulting in inevitable disjunctions between the
formal rules of the state and the informal practices of many subpopula-
tions (Scott, 1969, p. 1143). In practice, office holders often accommo-
date various social actors, adapting formal institutions of the state to
local contexts through informal bargains (Helmke and Levitsky, 2006;
Migdal, Kohli, and Shue, 1994; Migdal, 1994). Foreign state-builders
operate at an enormous disadvantage by often being only dimly aware
of the nuances of such informal institutions. Moreover, foreign inter-
venors in the contemporary era operate on relatively short timelines,
while the process of accommodation between state and society typi-
cally unfolds over a much longer period. Intervenors such as the United
States also lack the ruthlessness for imposing change demonstrated by
historical empires. Consequently, in the short term, informal institu-
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 149
tions of governance will almost inevitably be better adapted to local
realities than would newly rebuilt formal state institutions.
Second, informal institutions already rooted in local society are
inexpensive and immediately available. In contrast, Western court sys-
tems, for instance, require substantial investment over years. Lawyers,
judges, and clerks must be trained, an extensive legal system must be
developed, records must be kept, and so on. Such systems are beyond
the reach of many developing countries, let alone post-conflict societies
(Haggard, MacIntyre, and Tiede, 2008, pp. 215–216; Samuels, 2006,
p. 18).13
Third, informal institutions are commonly both strong and resil-
ient. They have undertaken a great many functions of governance at
which the state has failed or for which the state’s capabilities need to be
supplemented. The networks of personal relationships on which infor-
mal institutions are based are often “held to form the critical ‘primary
environment’ by which an individual is related to the larger society”
(Friedkin, 2004, p. 416; see also Scott, 1969, pp. 1146–1146; Scott,
1962, p. 94).
Informal institutions play a ubiquitous role in the governance of
most developing countries. In Nigeria, informal merchant networks
supply more than 60 million city-dwellers with food from more than
60 million countryside producers, despite doing so with “no recourse
to legal systems, a corrupt and ineffective police force, minimal bank-
ing infrastructure, poor communications, and a highly degraded trans-
port infrastructure” (Lyon and Porter, 2009, p. 903). This vast market
relies on trust, reputation, informal systems of credit, and private
police forces hired by the merchants to monitor marketplaces. Sim-
ilar systems are responsible for maintaining a functioning economy
in large parts of Somalia despite the utter collapse of the state—and
indeed, in the better-run Somali localities, the economy is performing
better than it did under the Barre regime (Mubarak, 1996). Informal
institutions play a vital role in mediating disputes in countries where
the judicial system is so weak, corrupt, or inaccessible that it does not
play a significant role in many communities (Barfield, Nojumi, and
Thier, 2006; Decker, Sage, and Stefanova, 2005; Samuels, 2006, p. 18;
Widner, 2001). They also provide protection and policing functions for
150 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
the local community through such institutions as blood feuds, mili-
tias organized along tribal or religious lines, and organized criminal
“gangs” that enforce a form of order (while commonly demanding pay-
ment in return).
Weaknesses of Informal Institutions. Informal institutions also
have significant limitations. Relying on them to provide most gov-
ernance functions certainly saves a stabilization operation from the
hubris of ambitious state-building; it entails serious liabilities as well.
First, as already noted, informal institutions commonly operate
on a much smaller scale than the institutions of a modern state. In his
study of “informal economics,” Avinash Dixit (2004, p. 12) writes that
for informal institutions to work, “the society needs good information
networks and credible multilateral punishment strategies. . . . However,
the quality of information and the credibility of punishment both
degrade as the size of such a group increases.” Restricting economic
and political activity to smaller networks can mean foregoing econo-
mies of scale. As Bardhan (2000, pp. 219–220) argues, “A major prob-
lem of ‘collectivist’ systems of enforcement is that the boundaries of the
collectivity within which rewards and punishment are practiced may
not be the most efficient ones and they may inhibit potentially profit-
able transactions with people outside the collectivity.” Where informal
institutions depend on community ties such as those of a rural village
or kinship structures, relying on them for governance often implies a
radical geographic decentralization (localization) of power. In such sys-
tems, the tendency is to over-invest in highly localized infrastructure
and under-invest in larger regional or national projects with substantial
economies of scale (e.g., highway networks or power grids) (Cheema
and Rondinelli, 2006, p. 8). A loss of efficiency may seem like a small
price to pay for obtaining some form of governance for an otherwise
chaotic country. Multiplied by innumerable transactions, however, and
recognizing the value of transportation and communication in any
modernization effort, the overall result is a substantial impediment to
economic growth. Even as he extols the various informal institutions
that have continued to provide governance and a functioning economy
in post-Barre Somalia, for instance, Jamil Mubarak (1996) makes clear
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 151
that significant and sustainable economic development will require the
formation of much stronger state institutions.
A second problem of informal governance concerns the regula-
tion of intercommunal relations. While communities have normative
codes, information, and enforcement mechanisms for punishing trans-
gressors within the community, few of these mechanisms are available
to regulate conflicts between communities. Without a centralized state
capable of resolving disputes and enforcing judgments between differ-
ent communities, severe crises can escalate, potentially requiring resort
to so-called self-help mechanisms, such as blood feuds and tribal mili-
tias (Bates, 2001). Where informal governance based on narrow com-
munity bonds is combined with centralized government and demo-
cratic elections, the result can be electoral mobilization on the basis of
narrow identities. Such mobilization can either trigger or exacerbate
divisive, even violent, politics (see, for instance, Belloni, 2008, p. 193;
Doherty, 2001). Of course, social networks also exist that bridge the
divides between different communities, but such bridging social net-
works are often too weak to regulate intercommunal tensions effec-
tively once strong central government institutions have broken down
and civil war erupts.14 In the absence of a strong central government
and other bridging mechanisms, a stabilization strategy that focuses
on local, informal governance institutions (such as tribal militias) may
result in only a decentralized and highly fragile balance of power that
requires the indefinite deployment of foreign troops to prevent collapse
(see, for instance, Dorronsoro, 2009, on Afghanistan).
Third, structures of informal governance are often (although
not necessarily) highly inequitable. Patron-client relationships, for
instance, are a common form of informal governance in which a pow-
erful patron provides for the needs of his clients in return for the clients’
loyalty. The clients’ basic needs are met—and may even be provided
for more effectively than under formal but dysfunctional institutions
of government—but the resulting social structure is highly unequal
(see especially Scott, 1962). Redressing every social injustice neither
can nor should be the aim of a stability operation. Where inequali-
ties generate intense discontent, however, and that discontent threat-
ens to become violent (or perpetuate violence), then social injustices
152 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
are indeed the concern of a stability operation. In the case of Sierra
Leone, for instance, high levels of corruption among the country’s “Big
Men” (patrons) fueled the anger of young men throughout the coun-
try, providing a ready source of recruits for the various militias as the
state weakened (Malan, Rakate, and McIntyre, 2002, Chapter 1). In
such circumstances, where traditional authorities are viewed with con-
siderable resentment by portions of the population, the restoration of
traditional authorities may arguably lay the groundwork for renewed
violence (Fanthorpe, 2006).
Finally, it may not be possible to restore informal institutions of
governance on the basis of traditional authorities because the tradi-
tional authorities were themselves weakened or destroyed during the
course of war. Stathis Kalyvas, for instance, dissects how traditional
patterns of alliance and conflict (social “cleavages”) radically realign in
periods of civil violence:
War may generate new local cleavages because power shifts at
the local level upset delicate arrangements. . . . One of the most
potent cleavages produced by civil wars is generational: rebels (but
also incumbents) often recruit young people who then proceed to
repress their village’s elders. The war may also lower the cost of
opportunistic behavior, triggering tens of local cleavages. When
local cleavages subvert central ones, factional conflicts emerge
within supposedly unified political camps. (2003, pp. 480–481)
Restoring “traditional authorities” as a means of restoring (infor-
mal) governance is frequently impossible, either because the traditional
authority-holders have been killed, or because the very nature of “tra-
ditional authority” is what was at stake in a civil war and attempts at
restoring it would immediately reignite the conflict. In Afghanistan,
for instance, observers have frequently questioned the reliability of
agreements brokered with tribal elders, because “it is not clear that the
elders, whatever their intentions, will be able to command the loyalties
of their own members. After 30 years of incessant warfare, many of the
traditional societal networks in this country have been weakened or
destroyed” (Filkins, 2010; on a related process in Pakistan’s tribal belt,
see Markey, 2008, p. 6). Similarly, critics of international peacebuild-
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 153
ing efforts in Mozambique charged that foreign officials and aid work-
ers sought to reinstate a form of “traditional authority” that was in fact
highly contested during that country’s civil war. Mozambique’s then–
Prime Minister, Pascoal Mocumbi, condemned such efforts in a reveal-
ing statement: “all those who demand a law on traditional authority
are demagogues that only wish to create problems for us, because tra-
ditional authority varies according to each individual’s own tradition”
(West and Kloeck-Jenson, 1999, p. 468). Even if the general popu-
lation agrees on who “traditional authorities” are and on their right
to hold authority, militias frequently displace traditional elites during
the course of conflict, making it difficult for the former authorities to
resume governance functions (see, for instance, Barfield, Nojumi, and
Thier, 2006, p. 16; Harpviken, 1996).
Assessing Informal Institutions. Arising from everyday social
relations, informal institutions are typically a strong, resilient, and
inexpensive form of governance. Unsurprisingly, it is to these forms
of governance—such as tribal militias, religious courts, and informal
marketplaces—that societies turn when state institutions begin to col-
lapse. Outside intervenors, however, must be careful when making use
of them. Such institutions tend to provide services inefficiently and
on a small scale, making them a poor basis for long-term economic
development. They provide little “connective tissue” to link the com-
munities of a deeply divided society emerging from a civil war. Rely-
ing on them may deepen divisions. Indeed, informal institutions may
even have been the initial source of conflict or the channels through
which conflict was directed. Restoring the status quo ante may then
set the country up for renewed conflict. Finally, the option to use the
informal institutions may only seem to exist: They may no longer be
viable because of the war, although local actors may seek to use foreign
intervenors to resurrect them.
Foreigners also encounter special difficulties in attempting to use
informal institutions. The economist Ben D’Exelle (2009), for instance,
finds that development specialists consistently misread the local politi-
cal dynamics of Nicaraguan villages—reinforcing the precise patterns
of behavior that they had sought to change, despite having had a siz-
able presence (accounting for 20 percent of gross national income) in
154 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Nicaragua for years. Similarly, the anthropologist Harry West and
his colleague Scott Kloeck-Jenson (1999) found that aid workers in
Mozambique fundamentally misunderstood the nature of traditional
authorities in that country, with the result that they unwittingly played
parts in furthering the highly partisan agendas of local actors rather
than promoting their intended peacebuilding visions. Similar stories
abound. Local actors are aware of the foreigners’ information disadvan-
tage and skillful at exploiting it (Blunt and Turner, 2005; Fanthorpe,
2006, p. 40).
Military personnel operate at an even greater disadvantage. Self-
studies by the U.S. armed forces have repeatedly found that available
training time and career incentives simply do not permit acquiring the
extensive local knowledge necessary to generate a future “Lawrence”
(Burton, 2009). Even if additional training time were allotted, it is far
from clear that the requisite knowledge can be gained without many
years of in-country experience (Bennett, no date).
Numbers and time scale also matter. Highly decentralized clear-
hold-build strategies are extraordinarily labor-intensive. Foreign inter-
venors will seldom have the troops and civilian experts needed for suc-
cess (Dorronsoro, 2009). Similarly, developing bottom-up governance
takes considerable time—time horizons inconsistent with modern-day
foreign intervenors. The result is an emphasis on top-down strategies
that conform poorly to the realities of civil society development (Bel-
loni, 2008).
Finally, even if stabilization through informal governance is
achieved, it may not meet the goals of intervenors. Tajikistan, for
instance, was hailed by many as an example of “autonomous recov-
ery” from civil war. The formal provisions of the 1997 power-sharing
agreement that ended Tajikistan’s civil war quickly failed, but the peace
endured—largely because of an informal accommodation between the
government and opposition, where the various warlords of Tajikistan
effectively functioned autonomously. These warlords, however, rap-
idly expanded their narcotics trafficking in postwar Tajikistan (Paoli,
Greenfield, and Reuter, 2009, Chapter 9), and Islamic extremist groups
thrived (ICG, 2001). Over time, there has been a long-term decline
in the country’s economy, as well as renewed violence (ICG, 2009).
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 155
To make things worse, if the intervenor’s objectives include achieving
human rights, the prospect of a result with extreme versions of sharia
law prohibiting the education of girls and encouraging practices such
as stoning of women, amputation of hands, and the like, will not be
palatable.
The strengths, weaknesses, and challenges of working with infor-
mal institutions as opposed to building strong, formal state structures
are summarized in Table 4.2.
The conditions under which informal governance is most likely
to work are precisely the conditions that are absent during periods
of insurgency or their immediate aftermath. “Bridging” elements of
civil society are most likely to function effectively prior to the polar-
ization that accompanies descent into large-scale violence (Belloni,
2008, p. 188; Kaufmann, 1996). They are most likely to form around
common material interests, such as mutually beneficial trading rela-
tionships (Varshney, 2002), but such shared interests are relatively few
when the state and formal economy have collapsed. Informal gover-
nance may provide many important functions at the local level, but
such functions are best performed in the presence of a central state
capable of providing statewide public goods and regulating disputes
between localities (Belloni, 2008, pp. 188, 204; Doherty, 2001; Wood-

ward, 2002, pp. 29–30). Indeed, Belloni (2008, p. 208) goes so far as
to proclaim that a “healthy civil society is the sign of a well-functioning
state, not its cause.”
Clearly, informal institutions of governance have an important
role to play in stabilizing societies recovering from civil war and state-
lessness. Ideally, it would be possible to find ways of linking infor-
mal practices of governance with the central state so that each would
strengthen the other in a mutually beneficial relationship that would
evolve over time. Many have therefore called for gradualist strategies of
stabilization. They, however, have their own problems, as discussed in
the next section.
The Dilemma of Transition
Given the inclusion and state-capacity dilemmas, many critics of lib-
eral democratic state-building have recommended alternatives that
de-emphasize rapid transitions to elections and a strong central state.
They argue that for sustainable peace and development to take root in
post-conflict countries, strong political coalitions with a vested inter-
est in a new political order must form. This, however, cannot happen
overnight; a lengthy period is required in which new political relation-
ships, norms, and loyalties are forged. Extended, incremental transi-
tions seem to be a pragmatic response to the hubris of ambitious proj-
ects of political transformation.
Such evolutionary strategies pose their own challenges, however,
resulting in the third dilemma of stabilization:
The Dilemma of Transition. The transitional institutions and
practices that may be necessary to secure an end to a civil war or
insurgency are often very poor foundations for efficient and stable
government in the long term. Once institutions are in place, how-
ever, power relationships tend to “crystallize” around them in a
path-dependent manner, making them highly resistant to change
through peaceful transition.15
Crises tend to shorten time horizons.16 In stabilization missions,
the focus on the short-term tends to produce peace settlements that
satisfy the warring parties’ immediate demands but may not provide an
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 157
institutional framework that can be self-sustaining in the long run. The
end result may be the commitment of enormous resources to a strategy
that does not serve the country’s long-term interests. Decisionmakers
thus must consider both the short and longer terms (see also Chapter
Six).
One of the central challenges in stabilization is to manage the
gradual transition from war to a self-sustaining, peaceful political
order. Each of the three primary approaches to stabilization—liberal
democratic state-building, controlled state-building, and decentral-
ized stability—has a different notion of how that evolution is likely to
unfold. All are complicated by the transition dilemma.
Advocates of liberal democratic state-building recognize that sta-
bility operations will never be able to create “new Switzerlands,” but they
contend that gradual democratization (conditioned by formal mecha-
nisms of power-sharing) is the “least bad” alternative. Proponents seek
to erect more or less democratic institutions in countries hosting stabil-
ity operations, accepting that they will function highly imperfectly at
first. Over time, however, even imperfect democratic institutions can
form a viable framework in which local actors can evolve. So long as
the international community provides considerable assistance to but-
tress this process and prevent its collapse, then local actors will respond
to the incentive structures provided by the democratic institutions and
international aid. Even leaders with authoritarian inclinations will
approximate the behavior of democrats if given sufficient incentives to
do so; the longer such incentives remain in place, the more likely that
politicians will eventually stop pretending and ultimately will actually
become democrats (Rustow, 1970; Lindberg, 2006).
Proponents of controlled state-building also expect transitions to
occur gradually. Indeed, much of the modernization literature of the
1960s was explicitly teleological, claiming that economic growth was
a “precondition” for democracy, but that democracy would inevitably
arise once economic fundamentals, such as a large middle class and
widespread literacy, were in place. Similarly, Jeane Kirkpatrick (1979)
claimed that authoritarianism may be inevitable in the short term in
most of the developing world, but U.S. support for such regimes was
ultimately justified because it provided the best long-term prospects for
democracy.
158 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Gradualist or evolutionary notions pervade thinking about decen-
tralized S&R strategies. Many observers of stability operations have
recommended building stability on the basis of informal institutions in
the short term, while simultaneously seeking to link them to the central
state and ultimately to transform them into more formalized mecha-
nisms of governance in the long term (Mubarak, 1996; Samuels, 2006,
p. 18). This view holds that formal government institutions, so long
as they function well, will ultimately displace informal governance. A
former U.S. civilian official in southern Afghanistan, Frank Ruggiero,
recently predicted, “As you build up the strength of the formal func-
tions of the state, the informal actors will see some of their powers fade
away” (Trofimov, 2010).
Unfortunately, the institutions of governance put in place in the
initial transition, whether formal or informal, tend to become highly
resistant to change short of complete collapse and renewed fighting
(Rothchild and Roeder, 2005). This “stickiness” is an example of path
dependency—the tendency of initial actions to have durable and dis-
proportionately large consequences over time.
The most powerful local actors in place at the end of a civil war
are likely to manipulate the construction of new institutions to their
own advantage. Even if institutions are imposed by international actors,
local actors are likely to adapt, building alliances and networks around
the opportunities and constraints presented. Once power relationships
have “crystallized” around these institutional frameworks, local elites
become highly resistant to any significant institutional changes, even
if the institutions in place are dysfunctional for society as a whole. Per-
haps the archetypal example is post-Dayton Bosnia, where many of the
parties have fiercely resisted changes to the deadlock-prone institutions
of the Dayton Accords. A similar story could be told about the Feder-
ally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan, where systems of
government put in place at the time of Pakistan’s independence have
proven highly durable, despite the significant obstacles to stability that
they pose today (Markey, 2008, p. 8). Other examples abound, and
analysts of post-conflict transitions repeatedly warn about the path
dependency of early institutional choices (Kovacs, 2008, pp. 141–142;
Lyons, 2004, pp. 260–261; Roeder and Rothchild, 2005; Samuels,
2006, p. 19; Woodward, 2002, p. 20), as do observers of institutional
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 159
formation more generally (see especially Levitsky and Murillo, 2009,
p. 123).
Not only do elites respond to the incentive structures created by
institutions, but so too does the general population, making a gradual
transition from less to more democratic structures (or from less formal
to more formal governance) difficult. If citizens observe in the early
post-conflict period that antidemocratic behaviors are not punished
(either by the public through the ballot box or by external interve-
nors), then such behaviors become the popular expectation. The public
is then unlikely to invest the time and effort (or take the risks) neces-
sary to organize to demand greater accountability from elected officials
(Diamond, 1999, Chapter 5). As undemocratic institutions persist, they
thus become more deeply entrenched. Similarly, as corruption persists,
individuals and businesses become less likely to pay their taxes, less
likely to refer disputes to formal judicial institutions, more likely to pay
bribes, and less likely to participate in the licit economy more generally
(Hellman and Kaufmann, 2002), making it difficult to transition from
weak governmental institutions to stronger ones. Related dynamics
have been observed in the field of decentralization (Blunt and Turner,
2005, p. 85) and elsewhere.
Relying on incremental progress in reform agendas can thus be
thwarted by path-dependent dynamics among elites and non-elites
alike. Reforms can become frozen in what Joel Hellman (1998) has
called “partial reform equilibria,” where elites permit reforms to pro-
ceed only insofar as they can manipulate them to their own political
and economic advantage. Such partial reform equilibria can be worse
than the complete absence of reform. Although the implications are
much broader, Hellman focuses on economic reforms in the former
Soviet Union, where political elites in Russia and elsewhere intro-
duced partial economic reforms that caused tremendous market dis-
tortions. These generated enormous rents—an economic term referring
to the profits that can be earned in excess of the next-best investment
opportunity:
[R]ent-seeking activities have been ubiquitous in the postcom-
munist transitions. Rapid foreign trade liberalization with incom-
plete price liberalization has allowed state enterprise managers to
160 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
sell their highly subsidized natural resource inputs (for example,
oil and gas) to foreign buyers at world market prices. Price liberal-
ization without concomitant progress in opening market entry or
breaking up monopolies has created opportunities for some pro-
ducers to earn monopoly rents. Privatization without reform of
the credit mechanism has allowed managers to divert subsidized
state credits earmarked to uphold production into short-term
money markets at high interest rates. In each case, these arbitrage
opportunities have generated rents to those in a position to take
advantage of these market distortions. (Hellman, 1998, p. 219)
Partial reforms, in other words, generated enormous rents for well-
connected businessmen above the returns available in a properly regu-
lated market economy. These oligarchs ensured that economic reforms
would stall, thereby continuing to reap the profits available from the
market distortions. They then were able to recycle a portion of their
outsized profits back into the political realm, ensuring the reelection of
politicians who would protect their rents. Similar partial reform equi-
libria are common in the countries in which stability operations take
place.
Even if elites are not purposefully stalling reforms, the introduc-
tion of new institutions can disrupt existing, informal practices with-
out providing an alternative that will be functional except in the long
term (Haggard, MacIntyre, and Tiede, 2008, pp. 220–221; Messick,
1999, p. 2).
Expecting reforms to unfold gradually, over the course of many
years or even decades, may seem like simple prudence. Unless the tran-
sition is managed carefully, however, the results can in fact be worse
than no reform at all.
The dangers of gradual transition are all the greater when under-
stood in the context of the ever-present possibility of a return to con-
flict. Unless a transition can quickly demonstrate either concrete
results (Walter, 2004) or, at a very minimum, a real promise of signifi-
cant change for the better, post-conflict states are at very high risk of
descending back into violence. Such risks are particularly acute in the
case of transitions to democracy.
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 161
Paths to Stabilization
The dilemmas of stabilization truly are dilemmas: They impose diffi-
cult trade-offs, and we should not assume that a sufficiently clever strat-
egy will enable us to avoid the painful choices they imply. Ultimately,
these dilemmas cannot be solved, only managed. Essential to manag-
ing these dilemmas is matching intervention strategies to the appropri-
ate environments. Unfortunately, the social-science literature does not
provide any hard-and-fast rules for formulating such strategies. This
final section proposes a typology of stabilization environments and a
few provisional rules of thumb for adapting to these different contexts.
Understanding Stabilization Environments
When the United States has intervened in the post–Cold War era, it
has typically done so to achieve what might be called “inclusive stabil-
ity,” i.e., the absence of fighting and the political inclusion of major
parties. External powers can encourage inclusive stability by manip-
ulating the incentive structures of the opposed parties—the costs of
fighting, the odds of winning, or the benefits of peace. This section will
focus primarily on warfighting (the costs of fighting and odds of win-
ning), since other chapters deal more extensively with the benefits of
peace (e.g., humanitarian and development assistance and peacebuild-
ing initiatives). In particular, this section focuses on two factors:
• the availability of resources
• the distribution of power among the warring parties.
Although both of these factors can be manipulated by external
powers, achieving the desired outcomes is typically extremely difficult
once a country has descended into large-scale violence. In more con-
tested environments, there have only been a handful of cases in which
the post-conflict state has achieved inclusive stability, at least in the
short-to-medium term, without the assistance of a large external mili-
tary intervention. These factors can, however, tell us much about the
likelihood of success, the most likely dangers that a particular state will
162 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
face in its war-to-peace transition, and the sorts of strategies that inter-
vening states should adopt.
Availability of Resources. Drawing first on the statistical les-
sons from history, we note that a large proportion of the success stories
of stability operations from the late 20th century are associated with
the conjunction of two factors: the abrupt end of the Cold War and
related funding of combatants by the superpowers, and the absence
of alternative sources of financing for opposition factions. The end of
the Cold War (and the end of apartheid in South Africa) deprived fac-
tions in numerous proxy wars of their sources of support. Where new
external patrons for the warring parties did not exist, and where easily
lootable resources did not provide an alternative source of finances and
weapons, the conflicts burned out quickly. In these cases—including
Namibia, Mozambique, Ethiopia, El Salvador, and Nicaragua—peace
has endured, and most of the ensuing regimes have become relatively
democratic. Where, however, easily lootable resources provided an
alternative source of financing, as in Angola (diamonds) and Afghani-
stan (opiates), the conflicts that began as Cold War–era proxy wars
metamorphosed and continued.17
Interestingly, the availability of resources has more explanatory
power for understanding the historical cases than whether stability
operations occurred. Stability operations in the form of UN peacekeep-
ing missions were deployed to all of these countries except Afghanistan
and Ethiopia; many were considered to be important peacekeeping
successes. However, there were sizable stability operations that failed
(Angola), tiny stability operations that succeeded (e.g., Nicaragua), and
cases with no stability operations whatsoever that also turned out well
(e.g., Ethiopia). In contrast to the mixed record of stability operations
in these cases, results correlate well with the existence of resources (i.e.,
external patrons or lootable resources).
The importance of resources to the outcomes of recent war-to-
peace transitions suggests that cutting off resources may be an impor-
tant tool for the international community—and potentially much
more inexpensive and risky than direct S&R missions. International
actors have a number of instruments available to starve a conflict of
resources. One mechanism involves buyers’ cartels organized to ame-
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 163
liorate the conflict potential of the commodity (e.g., the Kimberly Pro-
cess). Another is a “neotrusteeship” mechanism, such as that put in
place for Chad (see Krasner, 2004, p. 114). Such mechanisms have
their limitations (see especially Pegg, 2006), but they potentially offer
a low-cost means of reducing the conflict potential of a target state.
Balances of Power. For purposes of simplification, we can dis-
tinguish among cases of low, medium, and high imbalances of power.
• Low Imbalance: Balanced distributions of power (i.e., low imbal-
ance) exist when neither the government nor any opposition fac-
tion or coalition is able to emerge victorious in war, and both or
all sides (government and opposition faction(s)) are able to main-
tain exclusive control over significant portions of the country’s
population or resources.18 Iraq between 2003 and 2007, and espe-
cially during the period of intense civil war between 2006 and
2007, is one example.
• Moderate Imbalance: An intermediate imbalance of power exists
when one side (usually the government) controls the majority of a
country’s population and territory but is constrained from seek-
ing a complete monopoly of power by the opposition’s residual
strength and/or the high anticipated costs of trying to seek such
a monopoly.19,20 Iraq after the 2007 “Anbar Awakening” is an
example.
• High Imbalance: A highly imbalanced distribution of power exists
when one faction is able to decisively defeat all armed challengers
to the state, and these challengers also lack nonmilitary means of
constraining the victors. Iraq under Saddam Hussein is one clear
example.
As the inclusion dilemma suggests, the balance of power is critical
to the outcomes of transition processes. If the goal of most negotiated
settlements is to substitute political competition for military competi-
tion, then we should expect the parties to a conflict to make politi-
cal demands roughly in proportion to their military capabilities. The
more evenly balanced the distribution of military capabilities, the more
each party to a conflict is likely to make political demands that are
164 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
inconsistent with the formation of a decisive, effective, and efficient
government. Moreover, the more evenly balanced the parties’ military
capabilities, the more likely they are to return to violence if they are
unable to secure their demands through negotiation, each party believ-
ing that it is likely to win in a renewed war. To the extent that external
intervenors desire short-term stability, they may seek to tilt the balance
of power decisively in favor of a favored faction. To the extent that
would-be stabilizers value political inclusion or believe that political
inclusion is the best guarantor of long-term stability, they may seek to
more evenly balance power among the factions (much as the Dayton
Accords did in Bosnia).
These two factors—the availability of resources for conflict and
the balance of power between warring parties—can be used to dis-
tinguish different operational environments for stability operations.
Drawing on both historical examples and the preceding discussion
of the dilemmas of stabilization and particularly on the inclusion
dilemma, we can discern different paths to inclusive stability in each of
these environments. Figure 4.2 provides a summary of the six logical
cases derived from the two factors with examples in each. 21 The follow-
ing four subsections cover the most benign cases (cells 1–2), cases pre-
disposed to political exclusion (cells 3–4), cases in which the balance
of power may facilitate mutual accommodation even in unfavorable
environments (cell 5), and what is perhaps the most challenging type of
case (and the one most often faced by would-be stabilizers), instances
of highly vulnerable balance (cell 6).
Structures Conducive to Inclusive Stability
The most benign structures (cells 1–2) for stability operations are those
in which the environment inhibits renewed fighting and where the dis-
tribution of power is either balanced or only moderately imbalanced.
Where the environment provides few of the raw materials for renewed
fighting and the distribution of power is not tilted heavily, war-to-peace
transitions are much more likely to succeed. As mentioned earlier, the
end of the Cold War yielded a number of such examples. The peace
settlements to nearly all such conflicts have proven stable, and most
have proven fairly democratic as well. These cases were concentrated in
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 165
the late Cold War hot spots of Central America and southern Africa. 22
Where the wars in question concluded with a relatively balanced dis-
tribution of power, the results have been both stable and increasingly
democratic over time. Mozambique and El Salvador, for instance, have
long rated in the top half of Freedom House’s democracy index (Free-
dom House, 1972–2010), and El Salvador recently experienced its first
democratic, peaceful alternation of executive power in the postwar
period—a milestone for any post-conflict country.
Cambodia and Nicaragua provide a revealing contrast. In both,
communist parties held power at the end of the Cold War. In Cam-
bodia the former communist Hun Sen used his dominant position to
oust winners of the 1993 elections, FUNCINPEC, in what has been
described by many as a coup. In Nicaragua, in contrast, the Sandinistas
acceded to their election defeat. The Cambodian example is consistent
with the idea that imbalanced orders tend to be less politically inclusive

than those characterized by balances of power. However, because the
resources for the opposition to keep fighting in both Cambodia and
Nicaragua declined precipitously with the end of the Cold War, what
might have been highly destabilizing events—the 1997 coup in Cam-
bodia and the 1990 electoral defeat of the ruling Sandinistas—both
proceeded without reigniting war.
Highly Imbalanced Structures
Where one party can decisively defeat its rivals, short- and medium-
term stability is likely to be relatively high, but purchased at the price
of repression (cells 3 and 4 in Figure 4.2).
Cases in which the governing faction maintains a fully dominant
position in a less threatening environment are more likely to be stable
and may be somewhat more inclusive, but even in these relatively more
favorable environments, broad political inclusion is rare. Uganda pro-
vides a telling example. Although it is frequently cited as an instance
of “autonomous recovery,” Uganda is a relatively “easy case”; it suffers
neither from the “lootable-resource curse” of natural-resource wealth
that might fuel conflict, nor from external parties arming insurgents.
Nonetheless, Uganda under Yoweri Museveni has never scored in the
upper half of the Freedom House index of democracy (Freedom House,
1972–2010).
Highly imbalanced political orders in more threatening environ-
ments are less stable, but they are also much more likely to be highly
repressive. Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War
and Slobodan Milosevic’s Kosovo are clear examples. In all of these
cases, repression was able to maintain the regime in power and the
territorial integrity of the state, but these regimes ultimately laid the
foundations for their own downfall.
Stability operations that either oversee or create a highly imbal-
anced political order must provide effective protection for marginal-
ized parties or else risk catastrophe. Stability operations can provide
useful services in such environments, such as UNTAES (the United
Nations Transitional Authority in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and West-
ern Sirmium) in Croatia. But the past two decades are full of examples
of regimes that sought to take advantage of windows of opportunity
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 167
to permanently subdue minority populations. Stability operations have
often failed to protect minorities in such cases, whether it be the fail-
ure of UNAMIR (the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda)
when faced with Rwandan Hutu genocidaires in 1994, or (to a much
lesser degree) the failure of UNMIK (the UN Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo) and KFOR (the NATO Kosovo Force) to protect
Kosovar Serbs from ethnic Albanian extremists.
Vulnerable Dominance
Cell 5 corresponds to an unfavorable environment and moderate imbal-
ance of power. Governments that hold a preponderance but not an
absolute monopoly of power represent a middle ground. They are not
as stable as when the power balance is extreme, nor so inclusive as with
a balanced distribution of power. They are, however, somewhat more
inclusive and somewhat more stable than the two extremes. Making
dominant coalitions work requires a delicate balancing act. Often, such
dominant coalitions are themselves highly fractious, as was the case in
the Democratic Republic of Congo. Without constraints, the majority
faction can attempt to exploit its initial advantage to secure a monopo-
listic position, as the Sierre Leone People’s Party (SLPP) attempted in
Sierra Leone. Despite their imperfections, however, these constrained-
dominant governments proved superior to the alternatives in Sierra
Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Tajikistan, and ulti-
mately in Iraq after the Anbar Awakening.
Perhaps because of the fragility of balanced distributions of
power, even ostensibly neutral external actors often act to strengthen
favored parties during the course of stability operations. The European
Union, for instance, was widely suspected of supporting Joseph Kabila
against his rivals in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Englebert and
Tull, 2008, p. 133), and Britain intervened decisively on behalf of the
government of Sierra Leone against the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) and other militias.
Vulnerable Balances
The last case (cell 6 in Figure 4.2) involves relatively balanced power but
with an unfavorable environment. This is perhaps the most common—
168 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
and the most difficult—situation for stability operations. Stabilizers are
dispatched to such countries for the precise reason that the local par-
ties themselves cannot bring the war to a conclusion. In such circum-
stances, it should come as little surprise that foreign powers also have
difficulty in restoring peace, much less inclusive peace.
Recent history is littered with examples. In Angola, the UNAVEM
(United Nations Angola Verification Mission II) peacekeeping mis-
sion was helpless to prevent the country’s two primary antagonists, the
MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) and UNITA
(Union for the Total Independence of Angola), from returning to civil
war following the country’s 1992 elections. Diamonds and oil pro-
vided the fuel for continued fighting, and Angola’s civil war lasted until
2002, when government troops killed the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi
and defeated the rebel UNITA forces. As social-science theory would
predict, the peace that proved elusive in 1992 when the parties to the
conflict had comparable capabilities has proven much more stable since
the defeat of UNITA, despite the fact that no sizable stability operation
facilitated the transition in 2002. Despite the advantages of peace and
a booming economy based on oil revenues, Angola has remained auto-
cratic, rating “not free” on Freedom House’s democracy index (Free-
dom House, 1972–2010)—again, just as we would expect from the
framework of Table 4.1.
Peace in Sierra Leone was similarly elusive so long as the par-
ties’ capabilities were balanced. Fighting was again fueled by so-called
blood diamonds. The international community repeatedly attempted
to broker power-sharing arrangements between the government and
the rebel Revolutionary United Front under Foday Sankoh, buttressed
by a Nigerian-led ECOMOG (Military Observer Group of the Eco-
nomic Community of West African States) peace operation and later
by UNAMSIL (the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone). Sankoh,
however, consistently believed he had more to gain from continued
fighting than from power-sharing. Stability was only achieved when the
balance of power tilted decisively in favor of the government, thanks to
British forces and a British-brokered dominant coalition of anti-RUF
forces (Richards, 2000).
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 169
Balanced distributions of power, in short, favor inclusive political
orders, but such orders are extremely fragile in unfavorable environ-
ments, with or without the presence of a stability operation.
Paths Toward Stabilization: Tentative Prescriptions for Precarious
Transitions
A number of policy suggestions follow from this analysis, although
they have not been empirically tested in any detail and should therefore
be seen as provisional conclusions rather than established guidance.
The precise implementation of the suggestions would vary from one
context to another, but as rules of thumb they can help to guide the
formulation of strategy for stability operations.
1. Reduce the vulnerability of the state by reducing the
resources for conflict.
• Build regional security arrangements that reduce or elimi-
nate foreign sponsorship of the warring parties.
• If the parties are exploiting natural resources to support
their fighting, then consider mechanisms such as buyers’
cartels or “neotrusteeship” mechanisms.
2. Balance the desirability of political inclusion with the need
to create a functioning government.
• If a party to the conflict can be accommodated without
sacrificing vital interests of the local government or the
intervening powers, every effort should be made to facili-
tate political inclusion. In favorable intervention environ-
ments, the likelihood of success is high. In less favorable
intervention environments, the risk of political paralysis in
a powersharing arrangement is high, and would-be stabiliz-
ers will be required to stabilize the situation and facilitate
the political process for an extended period of time.
• If a party to the conflict cannot be accommodated with-
out sacrificing vital interests, and if that party does not
enjoy substantial popular support, then the balance of
power should be altered in favor of the local ally. Such
170 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
an approach, however, will require considerable efforts to
restrain the government from abusing its dominant posi-
tion, especially when the potential for renewed conflict is
high.
• If a party to the conflict cannot be accommodated without
sacrificing vital interests, but that party enjoys substantial
popular support, then would-be stabilizers face an extreme
challenge. If possible, intervenors will have to take mea-
sures to reformulate the challenge into a more tractable
one, ideally through “wedge strategies” designed to sepa-
rate irreconcilable parties from those who are willing to
join a power-sharing government under reasonable terms.
3. Shape negotiations and the conduct of stability operations
based on the reality of underlying power balances.
• Avoid peace negotiations divorced from underlying power
balances, since doing so can undercut incentives to stop
fighting, can lead to de jure implementation but with major
de facto efforts contrary to the agreement, and can even
cause efforts to preemptively create “facts on the ground”
at the expense of civilian populations. 23
• If institutions are crafted that are inconsistent with the bal-
ance of power, then intervenors should prepare to “make
up the difference” themselves, through an application of
carrots and sticks over an extended period.
4. Protect vulnerable groups.
• In seeking a dominant coalition, or if building political
institutions that do not accord with the underlying bal-
ance of power, provide long-term protection for vulnerable
groups through a combination of institutional protections
and credible and sustainable carrots and sticks.
• Regard providing such protections as both a moral impera-
tive and as potentially necessary to prevent the radicaliza-
tion of vulnerable groups (Kilcullen, 2009) or other desta-
bilizing outcomes.
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 171
5. Plan for evolution of the parties’ bases of power.
• Anticipate transitions over time in terms of which groups
hold power, the basis of their power, and the way in which
they exercise it. To the extent possible, avoid fashioning
institutions (such as constitutions or electoral systems) in
such a way as to prevent evolution toward more inclusive
and responsive political orders.
• Recognize that organizations will frequently operate out-
side or on the fringes of law with networks that fuse the
functions of political parties, patronage pyramids, gangs
or militias, and illicit or semi-licit economic networks. Pro-
vide incentives to draw them into formal institutions and
the rule of law.
Conclusions
The architects of stability operations are in an unenviable position.
Ambitious projects of rapid democratization, as prescribed by the lib-
eral democratic state-building orthodoxy common in the immedi-
ate post–Cold War period, have been viewed with increasing skepti-
cism over the past several years. Many observers instead recommend
strategies of controlled state-building or decentralized S&R, sacrific-
ing either political inclusion or strong state institutions, at least in the
short term, for the sake of more easily attainable goals. Yet the limi-
tations of these alternative approaches should not be underestimated
either. Controlled state-building too often yields autocracy, repression,
and sometimes even genocide. In addition to the moral considerations,
autocratic and violent processes of state-building generate their own
“security externalities,” such as refugee crises and radicalization, and
American support for such strategies properly has proven difficult to
sustain domestically. Decentralized S&R is also more easily achiev-
able than democratic transformation, but it risks creating a perpetu-
ally weak state unable to foster long-term development and unable to
police illicit transnational networks (such as those of narcotics traf-
fickers or terrorists) operating within its own borders. Because of these
172 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
limitations of controlled state-building and decentralized S&R, many
proponents of such approaches see them as interim measures; the long-
term goal remains the creation of a capable state responsive to its public
through inclusive and participatory political institutions. Such gradual
transitions, however, are hampered by path-dependent dynamics, and
transitional institutions too often are ineffectual and fragile.
These dilemmas are daunting but not insurmountable. Even such
highly challenging environments as wartime Bosnia or Iraq have been sta
bilized with sufficient investment of troops and resources. Many factors
affecting the success of war-to-peace transitions—such as the country’s
level of development—are effectively beyond outside powers’ ability
to affect, at least in the short-to-medium term. The challenge faced by
those who plan and conduct stability operations is to leverage those
factors that are in intervenors’ control—the scope and strategy of the
stability operation—to best effect.
The tentative prescriptions outlined are not “recipes for suc-
cess” so much as means of mitigating negative risk while also provid-
ing incentives for more positive outcomes. While such ambitions are
modest, they are consistent with the trajectories of many successful
war-to-peace transitions. Although these transitions are difficult, the
historical record indicates that they are possible—indeed, persever-
ance and learning have led to successes where once they were thought
impossible. Hopefully, the lessons of past operations and past transi-
tions will reduce the costs endured while adapting to the next stabiliza-
tion challenge.
Endnotes
1 Representative of this understanding is Boutros-Ghali (1996), in which he pro-
claims that
Democratic institutions and processes channel competing interests into arenas
of discourse and provide means of compromise which can be respected by all
participants in debates, thereby minimizing the risk that differences or dis-
putes will erupt into armed conflict or confrontation. Because democratic
Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through
periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms, they are more likely to
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 173
promote and respect the rule of law, respect individual and minority rights,
cope effectively with social conflict, absorb migrant populations and respond
to the needs of marginalized groups. They are therefore less likely to abuse their
power against the peoples of their own State territories. Democracy within
States thus fosters the evolution of the social contract upon which lasting peace
can be built. In this way, a culture of democracy is fundamentally a culture of
peace. (p. 6-6)
2 The United States, of course, had intervened in numerous “small wars” for
decades before the 1960s. Counterinsurgency in its modern form, however, did not
become a central foreign policy preoccupation until later.
3 Inglehart (1996) provides a more recent articulation of modernization theory.
4 Samuel Huntington (1991) introduced the concept of “waves of democratiza-
tion.” The first, long wave of democratization had its roots in the American and
French Revolutions, but the majority of countries in this wave democratized between
1828 and 1926. This wave included most of the countries of Europe and the British
overseas dominions. The second wave occurred in the period immediately follow-
ing World War II and lasted until the early 1960s, encompassing the former Axis
powers of the war as well as many countries in Latin America. The third wave began
in the 1960s. It was initially concentrated in southern Europe (Spain, Portugal, and
Greece) and South America (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay), but eventually it spread
into Central America and Asia (Turkey, the Philippines, and South Korea), and ulti-
mately it engulfed the Soviet bloc countries.
5 The social-science literature on the resolution of civil wars is vast. On the con-
tributions of democracy to peace-building, see especially Hegre et al., 2001. On
the effectiveness of power-sharing, see Hartzell, 1999, and Hartzell, Hoddie, and
Rothchild, 2001. On the role of external (especially UN) intervention, see especially
Doyle and Sambanis, 2000 and 2006; Fortna, 2008; and Walter, 2002.
6 Skeptical treatments of democracy motivated in part by the international experi-
ences of the 1990s include Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Kaufmann, 1996; Mansfield
and Snyder, 2002; Marten, 2004; Paris, 1996 and 2004; Snyder, 2000; and Wein-
stein, 2005. On the difficulties involved in “exporting” democracy, see, for instance,
Bellamy and Williams, 2004; Carothers 2004, p. 232; and Whitehead, 1986, p. 5.
These arguments will be explored at much greater length below.
7 Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald E. Neumann, for instance,
recently commented,
The lack of realism in the U.S. is leading to demands in Afghanistan that are
not only unrealistic but may be dangerous. . . . To expect that the fourth-poor-
est nation on earth, with high illiteracy and an education system being rebuilt
from near total destruction will produce an effective and efficient government
in another year or two is wishful thinking. (Martin, 2010)
174 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
8 Examples include Freier, 2009; Gant, 2009; Jones, 2008; and Kilcullen, 2009.
9 Again, the list is too long to recount here, but recent examples include Ellis,
2005; Englebert and Tull, 2008; Etzioni, 2004; Herbst, 1996; Knaus and Martin,
2003; Marten, 2004; and Weinstein, 2005. Older research in this vein includes
Packenham, 1963, and Shafer, 1988.
10 See also the discussion in Chapter Two, by Christopher Chivvis and Paul Davis,
which sketches a conceptual model based largely in the literature, augmented by
considerations that go beyond the commonly emphasized rational-choice model.
11 Researchers studying Latin America have found a positive relationship between
preparations for external wars and state-building, but they have found a negative
relationship between internal conflict and state-building. See, for instance, Thies,
2005, and Cardenas, 2010.
12 Another criticism is that Fortna’s concept of “ties” combines negotiated settle-
ments with ceasefires and informal truces.
13 At the end of the civil war in Sierra Leone, for instance, the country had only
125 lawyers for a population of approximately 5 million people (Decker, Sage, and
Stefanova, 2005, p. 15); some 60 percent of the population had not seen an admin-
istrative representative of any sort in approximately two decades (Malan, Rakate,
and McIntyre, 2002, Chapter 4). In Cambodia “only a handful of legal practitio-
ners survived the Khmer Rouge regime and no student graduated from the Cam-
bodian law school between 1965 and 1996” (Decker, Sage, and Stefanova, 2005,
pp. 15–16). Even in many Latin American countries it is prohibitively expensive for
much of the population to prosecute a case in state courts, even if reliable (noncor-
rupt) courts can be found (Van Cott, 2006, p. 253).
14 Perhaps the best study of such “bridging” civil society is that of Ashutosh Varsh-
ney (2002), but even Varshney warns that the same moderating dynamics he finds
in India are not likely to be reproduced in societies rent by civil war (p. 11). See also
Belloni, 2008.
15 Rothchild and Roeder (2005) make this argument powerfully in their critique of
power-sharing such institutions as federalism, ethnic veto rights, and legislative seat
set-asides. The argument, however, can be applied much more broadly.
16 Policymakers discount the future because immediate stakes are high and the time
to make decisions is short. Such an approach is in many ways justifiable: The future
is highly uncertain, and if the immediate crisis cannot be adequately addressed,
then longer-term concerns may never become relevant.
17 Cambodia is an interesting “mixed” case. The end of Chinese and American sup-
port for the insurgent forces in Cambodia, combined with the end of Vietnamese
and Soviet support for Phnom Penh, was a critical step toward peace. The Khmer
Rouge was able to continue its operations, however, on the basis of illicit gem and
Political Dilemmas of Stabilization and Reconstruction 175
timber sales. The consolidation of the peace in Cambodia was not possible until the
government was able to broker a deal with one of the leading Khmer Rouge com-
manders, in which it extended him control of a gem- and timber-rich region near the
Thai border. See Ross, 2004, p. 54.
18 Here, control refers to control by power rather than influence. The cases treated
are different from, e.g., the power-balance issues in a working parliamentary
democracy.
19 The phrasing here allows for the possibility that the dominant side sees expense,
difficulty, diversion, or even impropriety in seeking total control—even though it
could be confident of success if it sought to destroy the opposition. That is, most
of this chapter reflects a “realist” perspective emphasizing power, but other factors
matter as well.
20 Both Byman (2002) and Snyder (2000) advocate carefully controlled processes
of political inclusion that somewhat resemble what is here called a dominant distri-
bution of power.
21 This breakdown is similar in spirit to the “ecologies of peace-building” discussed
in Doyle and Sambanis (2005).
22 It is possible that another reason for success is that the oppositions lost some of
their zeal with the abject failure of the Soviet Union and its communist ideology.
Since the struggles were only partially about political ideology, however, the more
parsimonious assumption is that the drying up of external forces was crucial.
23 If one party is clearly the dominant party in a conflict, for instance, then either
that fact will have to be recognized at some level in the peace agreement, or the
international community will have to provide the “muscle” necessary to enforce an
agreement that requires major concessions by the dominant party. Either of these
options is defensible. What is not defensible is demanding that a party accept peace
terms far worse than what it believes it could achieve on the battlefield, then failing
to back these demands up with credible threats of action. Such an approach likely
prolonged the war in Bosnia, to name but one example.

CHAPTER FIVE
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and
Cooperation
Elizabeth Wilke, Paul K. Davis, and Christopher S. Chivvis
This chapter addresses certain social aspects of intervention, focusing
on how sufficient cooperation among previously warring parties can
be achieved so that stabilization and reconstruction (S&R) efforts can
be successful. Though much depends on the context of the conflict—
the composition of fighting parties, political aims, and economic and
social backdrops, as well as international intervention—to facilitate
long-term S&R, post-conflict interventions need to establish basic
institutional structures that promote cooperation among groups in
society, especially those prone to competition and conflict. Trust is a
key enabler of cooperation, so the chapter’s question becomes, How
can useful degrees of trust and cooperation be created in a post-conflict
environment? *
Introduction
Almost every study of social reconstruction and post-conflict stabil-
ity calls for understanding conflict as the result of structural processes
and institutions that sustain and promote the escalation of conflict
(Botes, 2003; Jeong, 2003; Fisher, 2000; Widner, 2004; Donais, 2009;
Rubenstein, 2003b). These structures can include corrupt or nepotis-
* Regrettably, due to inevitable resource limitations, we were unable in this study to address
many other elements of the social component, such as the consequences of tribal relation-
ships, corruption, organized crime, and ethnicity.
188 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
tic courts that unfairly enforce laws; laws that routinely favor certain
groups over others; or economic growth that leaves behind certain
groups or denies them access to resources, either de jure or de facto. The
successful cessation of conflict in the long run will require the restructuring
of institutional structures to ensure fairness and access. Disputes of fair-
ness and equality arise daily in every society, and a successful resolu-
tion of intergroup conflict will require that mechanisms for assertively
and cooperatively dealing with differences be built into decision- and
policymaking processes.
Reestablishing peace and stability after conflict needs to include
such social processes as changing attitudes, behaviors, expectations,
social networks, and even culture. Post-conflict societies often have
relationships characterized by distrust, exclusion of “outgroups,” and
unconstructive competitive behavior. People have witnessed, taken
part in, or been victims of violence; groups across society have stereo-
typed and dehumanized others. Social relationships are strained fur-
ther by a lack of physical security and economic opportunity. To have
at least working relationships among stakeholder groups is vital to the
success of reconstruction (Kelman, 2008; Bar-Tal and Bennik, 2004;
Gaertner, Brewer, and Dovidio, 2005; Kaplan, 2009).
The psychological and social processes involved in post-conflict
social reconstruction should ideally encourage emotional healing,
positive contacts across groups, positive experiences with government,
breaking down negative stereotypes, increasing respect and empathy,
and positively adjusting cultural narratives. All of this is a tall order,
and what is actually feasible may be far less. Nonetheless, the extent
to which at least some of these occur can have a lasting impact on
whether or not peace is sustained (Kelman, 2008; Bar-Tal and Bennik,
2004; Gaertner, Brewer, and Dovidio, 2005; Kaplan, 2009). It follows
that those conducting S&R operations can benefit from the relevant
social science. What follows draws selectively on extensive literatures in
social psychology, sociology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, law,
economics, criminology, business, political science, and peace research.
Fortunately, these literatures reveal reason for optimism: Much can be
done—but not easily and certainly not quickly.
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 189
The next section identifies key themes from the literature relevant
to reconstructing society. The following section then applies them to
common post-conflict challenges, addressing both promise and pit-
falls. The last sections pull together approximate principles and con-
clude with a brief recapitulation.
Concepts, Literatures, and Themes
Concepts
It is useful at the outset to identify some important concepts and dis-
tinctions involving the terms cooperation, trust, distrust, social capital,
social reconciliation, and social reconstruction.
Cooperation. Cooperation is the coordination of efforts or activi-
ties to produce a mutually beneficial outcome (Hardin, 1995). Some
level of cooperation among parties previously engaged in violent con-
flict is essential if S&R is to succeed. Cooperation is not a zero-sum
game, which makes it different from competitive behavior or violence.
In fact, conflict scholars typically think of intergroup relationships as
falling along a cooperative-to-competitive spectrum (Table 5.1).1 Posi-
tive, cooperative group relations are characterized by trust and good
feeling; negative or competitive relationships are characterized by dis-
trust and negative social attitudes toward the other group(s).

190 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Cooperation, of course, can increase vulnerability: The willing-
ness of groups to cooperate depends on their expectations of the other’s
likelihood of also cooperating, which is why trust plays such a power-
ful role in cooperation. Groups are more likely to be cooperative when
there has been a history of cooperation, when structural conditions
provide incentives for cooperation, or when positive attitudes exist
about the trustworthiness of the other group. Because attitudes affect
expectations, interventions to improve attitudes are important. In addi-
tion, if relationships are strained or competitive, monitoring and incen-
tive structures may be needed to mitigate risks so that cooperation can
continue (Powell, 1996). Outside intervenors can promote cooperation
by contributing to environmental and institutional structures that pro-
mote cooperation.
Trust. Trust can be simply defined as positive expectations about the
actions of another party (Deutsch, 2000a), or a belief in, and willingness
to act on the basis of, the words and actions of another (Lewicki and
Wiethoff, 2000; McAllister, 1998). 2 Trust is relevant to S&R because
it affects cooperation, reducing uncertainty by providing expecta-
tions about the behaviors of people or groups (Axelrod, 1984). Trust
across groups is key to facilitating conflict resolution, partly because it
reduces the need for monitoring and punishment of parties in coop-
eration (Lewicki and Weithoff, 2000). Most scholars agree that while
trust is not a necessary condition for peace (Ward et al., 2006; Axelrod,
1984; Deutsch, 1973), it is necessary if the peacemaking process is to
take hold (Brune and Bossert, 2009; Gormley-Heenan and MacGinty,
2009).3 Some important factors involved in enhancing trust and coop-
eration are depicted in Figure 5.1 and elaborated below. The concepts
appearing in the tree will be discussed in what follows.
Types of Trust. Numerous scholars have identified types of trust,
with their distinctions and terminology reflecting parent disciplines.4
By and large, the biggest distinction in usage is between those coming
from a rational-choice perspective (e.g., economics, business, or politi-
cal science) and those coming from an emphasis on social construc-
tions and shared values (e.g., sociology, psychology). Fortunately,
good efforts have been made to relate and integrate the two perspec-
tives (Rousseau et al., 1998; Lewicki, Tomlinson, and Gillespie, 2006;
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 191
Saunders et al., 2010). Saunders et al. (2010) also specifically addresses
cross-cultural issues, which is useful to the present chapter.
With some simplification, only two types of trust need be dis-
tinguished here: calculation based and relational trust. This terminol-
ogy has the advantage of intuitive labels and allowing for considerable
generality. Calculation-based trust is a kind of trust that stems from
assessing (whether correctly or not) that trust is justified—for a very
concrete set of issues in a very concrete context—because it seems to
be in the interest of the other party, or in his or her habit, to behave
positively. This might be because it seems that different behavior will
be deterred, because the desired behavior is incentivized, because it
just “makes sense” (from the perceived perspective of the other), or
because it is consistent with observed behavior of the other party.5 Such
trust is intendedly rational 6 and requires neither emotions nor affinity

between parties, only that interests are best served by cooperation. As a
result, efforts to increase rational trust should be concerned with, e.g.,
(1) incentive structures, (2) guarantees, and (3) building a history of
repeated, positive interactions.7 Such trust is usually “thin” in that, if
the situation or issue changes, the trust may vanish quickly (i.e., it is
not necessarily transferrable).
In contrast, relationship-based trust stems from positive expecta-
tions about another’s behavior based on personal experience and ties.
Relational ties may be made by group membership, if, for example, the
other is part of the same family, group, tribe, community, people, or
nation and is assumed, therefore, to be trustworthy (which might or
might not be accurate). It may also be that the relationship has been
strong enough in the past (e.g., with shared experiences) so as to create
mutual empathy and the internalization of positive beliefs and good
will. Relationship-based trust may be relatively thick. It need not be
(people can drop their trust of even close family members or long-term
neighbors, depending on events), but it can be. Emotions, including
the sense of relationship itself, play a role. The key point is that rela-
tionships enjoying high levels of this “thick” trust typically require less
monitoring to ensure compliance than relationships with thinner trust
(Lewicki and Weithoff, 2000). It is this “thicker” trust that helps per-
petuate longer-term stability.
Developing thicker forms of trust in post-conflict situations
requires that group social identities become more inclusive and open
(Lewicki and Weithoff, 2000; Dietz, Gillespie, and Chao, 2010). This
means breaking down negative stereotypes that portray individuals
from other groups as subhuman, untrustworthy, or incapable of honor-
able behavior. Wearing away negative attitudes and stereotypes about
outgroup members makes it more likely that group members will be
able to view each other as human beings with goals, aims, and motiva-
tions similar to their own. In addition, creating new and inclusive iden-
tities, such as a national identity, that include members of all groups
may be a useful tool for creating cooperation and trust.
In most post-conflict situations, building calculation-based trust
will be the immediate aim. That, however, opens the door to building
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 193
relationship-based trust, which is the stronger and more enduring, over
time. Table 5.2 compares these types of trust.
Trust and Distrust. The literature varies as to whether distrust is
equivalent to a low level of trust or something else. The view taken here
is that it is something else. Specifically, rather than being the absence
of a positive expectation that an agent will behave positively, distrust
is used here to mean a positive expectation that an agent will behave
negatively. Not only do post-conflict societies lack trust, but they are
deeply distrusting. 8 This does not change quickly, even if groups have
enough trust to cooperate for specific narrow purposes. Figure 5.2
(adapted from Lewicki, Tomlinson, and Gillespie, 2006) distinguishes
among four cases defined by low or high trust and low or high distrust.
The bottom-right cell (low trust, high distrust) is all too characteristic
of many post-conflict societies. It is not merely that the parties in ques-
tion lack trust; rather, they are seriously worried about each other.

reduction and opportunity creation).
194 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Based on such considerations, Figure 5.3 suggests that even an
optimistic projection for a post-conflict society might anticipate very
high degrees of distrust for years, despite success in finding particular
issues and actions on which trust and cooperation can be obtained.
We might ponder history after World War II, noting that the nations
of Western Europe cooperated rather well after the creation of NATO
in 1949.9 Elements of distrust remained strong for years, however,
especially between Germany and its neighbors. Many decades later,
today’s Western Europeans see themselves collectively as Europeans,
and cooperate extensively in most dimensions while retaining national
identities. Thus, those involved in the social aspects of S&R should dis-
tinguish sharply between short, medium, and long-term goals—with
the latter being dependent on developments long after intervenors are
gone.
Horizontal and Vertical Trust. An important distinction also exists
between “vertical” trust (that between state and society) and “horizon-

tal” trust, i.e., trust across groups within society, such as between ethnic
groups. Reciprocal, self-sustaining processes have positive impacts for
both types of trust. Horizontally, the provision of services decreases
competitive behavior, and the consistent enforcement of rule of law
and justice decreases information asymmetry and risk in personal and
business interactions, increasing trusting and trustworthy behavior.
Vertically, as states become more able to perform vital functions—
equably and consistently—they build a history of positive interactions
with society that affect perceptions of state legitimacy and encourage
acceptance of state authority (Ghani and Lockhart, 2008). Wider pro-
cesses of state-building and improving state capacity to deliver services
equitably and uniformly, enforce justice and rule of law, and provide
common security are all integral to building both types of trust. This
chapter is largely about horizontal trust because of its importance in
social reconstruction. Also, vertical trust is addressed Chapter Three’s
discussion of the political component of S&R.
Social Capital. The concept of social capital, much discussed
in the literature, deserves mention here as a secondary layer of social

reconstruction that encompasses both trust and cooperation. Two defi-
nitions are worth mentioning:
Social capital includes trust, as well as other social and cultural
norms, values, and institutions that promote cooperation and col-
lective action. (Fukuyama, 2002)
Social capital includes the shared values and rules for social con-
duct expressed in personal relationships, trust and a common
sense of “civic” responsibility, which make a society more than
just a collection of individuals. (World Bank, 2011)
As seen from the definitions above, social capital not only includes
trust and cooperation but also encompasses other social functions that
are beyond the scope of this chapter but enhance social and political
stability (Putnam, 1995). The World Bank provides a useful conceptu-
alization of these functions under five broad component categories, as
shown in Table 5.3.
While interventions should focus on cooperative behavior as an
outcome, building positive social capital is an important component
of post-conflict social reconstruction. Positive social capital enhances
both the frequency and quality of cooperative behavior by reducing
uncertainty about outcomes and interactions and providing mecha-
nisms to accumulate goodwill between parties that facilitates politi-

cal and economic cooperation (Putnam, 1993). Rebuilding depleted
social capital is vital to reconstruction and is part and parcel of conflict
resolution. Social capital also has economic and political payoffs that
reinforce the reconstruction process over time (Glaeser, Laibson, and
Sacerdote, 2002; Knack and Keefer, 1997; Fukuyama, 1995; Brune
and Bossert, 2009).
Unfortunately, and despite the fact that academics and practitio-
ners usually assume that higher levels of social capital are beneficial
in society, it is not the case under the definitions above. Shared values
and rules, for example, can exist within groups and be detrimental to
society at large, e.g., the German Nazi party of the 1930s and 1940s
or American Ku Klux Klan members in the 20th century. This type of
social capital can have very negative effects. This said, in what follows
we have in mind positive social capital across groups, which facilitates
the social processes in Table 5.3, unless specified otherwise.
Social Reconciliation. At its heart, social reconciliation in the
social psychology literature refers to the process of (re)building func-
tioning, stable intergroup relationships that reinforce nonviolent means
of interaction. Social reconciliation as a concept lacks a unified defini-
tion.10 Some definitions focus on healing, reparations, justice, and truth;
they do not presuppose much trust in the immediate or medium-term
(Kumar, 1999; Gaertner, Brewer, and Dovidio, 2005). Indeed, many
definitions of reconciliation see reconciliation as necessary because of
the lack of trust (Kumar, 1999; Staub and Bar-Tal, 2003; Bloomfield,
Barnes, and Huyse, 2003; Gaertner, Brewer and Dovidio, 2005). That
is, social reconciliation processes are essential for rebuilding trusting
relationships.
While social reconciliation may be beneficial for society at large,
the term reconciliation is loaded and contentious. To many, the term
means “forgetting” the past violence that they have witnessed or suf-
fered. Many have deep feelings of hatred or fear toward their enemy
groups, which leave them unable or unwilling to engage on any level
with the other group. A major and more feasible goal of social recon-
ciliation is to promote tolerance. Doing so is also essential to building
even limited trust and cooperation; over time, with luck, it may also
lead to healing, empathy, and acceptance.
198 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
With this background on major themes, the next four subsections
touch briefly on several specific literature groups.
Identities, Stereotypes, and Narratives
The social psychology literature relevant to post-conflict processes deals
with issues such as bias, prejudice and stereotypes, identities, social
embeddedness, and the behavior of individuals in response to social
cues. There are also useful discussions of cultural history, cultural nar-
ratives and the formation of social identities (Brubaker, 1996; Barth,
1966), and the sources and dimensions of ethnic conflict (Horowitz,
1985; Lake and Rothchild, 1996; Brubaker, 2009; Brubaker and Laitin,
2005). Topics in psychology include grievance and emotional healing,
which provide insights for mechanisms of restorative justice and recon-
ciliation. Psychology also has much to say about cognitive biases and
the formation of individual attitudes, which can be juxtaposed with
the literature on social attitudes. There are several key concepts from
social psychology and sociology that are important for understanding
social interactions relating to cooperation and trust.
Social Identities and Attitudes. Identities are lenses through
which individuals perceive and make sense of the world (Brubaker,
2009). “Constructed” by learned and socialized attitudes, identities
frame individuals’ perceptions of social situations. Additionally, they
may themselves situationally vary (e.g., depending on who interacts
with whom or what cues define a situation).11 In post-conflict situa-
tions, individual identities are often less context-dependent and linked
to group identities. Though people commonly associate ethnicity,
gender, and racial identity as being the main identity groups, the struc-
ture of identities to the individual is far more complex. Identities may
conceivably be anything that serves to distinguish among people—
fighter/civilian, socialist/capitalist, elite/poor, Northerner/Southerner.
Similarly, certain identities are stronger than others to individuals;
family and community identities may be stronger than national or
regional identities. A good understanding of the “groups” in conflict
will require an intimate knowledge of the make-up of identity groups
in play.
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 199
Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Bias. Attitudes are formed from
socialized and independent learning about the way groups in society
interact. Attitudes influence expectations of cooperation and secu-
rity, as well as adherence to and expectations about others adhering to
norms of behavior (Gaertner, Brewer, and Dovidio, 2005). Attitudes
are closely related to stereotypes and biases.
Stereotypes are oversimplified, inaccurate, or overstated beliefs
about characteristics of an identity group. Groups in conflict tend to
hold negative stereotypes of one another (Fisher, 2000). Negative ste-
reotypes help ingroups to dehumanize outgroup members. Conversely,
positive outgroup stereotypes lead to favorable treatment of the ste-
reotyped group(s) and the positive interpretation of actions of group
members.
Narratives. Narratives define the collective past of identity group
members, creating a common origin and experience, which increases
social cohesion among group members but can also create grievances or
friction between groups with conflictive historical narratives.
Primacy of Group Attitudes. Some scholars have argued that
because individual identities tend to be very closely intertwined with
group identities, especially in post-conflict situations, attempts to
change social attitudes at the individual level may be relatively inef-
fective.12 Although programs exist to promote understanding between
opposing group members and have had some anecdotal success, the
effect of targeting individuals is not thoroughly tested. While strate-
gies to affect group attitudes obviously need to have effects on large
portions of the population, one idea would be to attempt to jump-start
cooperation in “pockets” that might then “cascade” to the remainder of
the group (Laitin, 1995; Kuran, 1998).13
The research on urban crime-reduction programs is worth brief
mention as well here, since—although not directly related to post-
conflict stability—it deals with cultural shifts resulting in violence
reduction. Dramatic success has been achieved in reducing violence in
a number of cities with programs that engage the small set of violent
gang offenders. The best known of the efforts is the Ceasefire approach
championed by David Kennedy (Braga et al., 2001a, 2001b).14 One tack
is deterrent in nature, making clear that failure to cease violence will
200 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
bring authorities down on the entire groups (curfews, tough enforce-
ment of parole conditions, hassling, etc). At the same time, interve-
nors urge the individuals to recognize that their violence is senseless
and wrong with reinforcement from respected or feared individuals
(mothers, clergy, leaders).15 The effort is also made to weaken identity
bonds by demonstrating the myths of close relationships (“brothers”
consistently make deals with prosecutors to save themselves; they rou-
tinely step in with the girlfriends of those who go to prison; etc). No
effort is made to achieve more general reform; the strategy has narrow
objectives.
Contact Theory
Contact theory is a long-established model for attitude change. It is
a reaction to the well-known observation that segregation or infre-
quent contact between groups helps maintain negative stereotypes and
mutual ignorance (e.g., Ajdukovic, 2008). The essential idea of con-
tact theory is that increased exposure, under certain conditions, gives
each party the opportunity to gather more information about the other
and adjust expectations and attitudes accordingly.16 For interactions
geared toward increasing contact and cooperation to be most effec-
tive in debunking stereotypes and improving relations, groups must
have equal status in the situation, must have common goals identi-
fied, and must have the support of authority figures who condone and
support cooperation (Allport, 1954). Through this kind of interaction,
ingroups and outgroups establish affective, or emotional ties, which
causes them to reappraise the negative stereotypes they hold and alter
social attitudes toward outgroup members (Pettigrew, 1998). Contact
can be direct, through physical interaction with opposing group mem-
bers, or indirect, through secondary channels, such as media or know-
ing that one’s friends interact with outgroup members. Both types
of contact positively affect outgroup attitudes, reduce prejudice, and
enhance intergroup trust in post-conflict situations (Pettigrew and
Tropp, 2006).
Cautions. Clearly, merely putting people together is by no means
sufficient. Indeed, as readers will understand, increased exposure or
contact can worsen matters so as to encourage competition rather than
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 201
cooperation (Deutsch, 1973; Saunders et al., 2010); also, behavior of
the “other’s” members may confirm rather than disconfirm negative
outgroup stereotypes (Hewstone et al., 2008; McGuire 1998). To put
it otherwise, contact theory is nothing at all like a panacea.
Post-Conflict Intervention
This section provides a general overview of the academic literature on
specific types of post-conflict social interventions, while subsequent
sections delve into greater detail.
Considerable literature exists on what makes post-conflict social
intervention programs effective or ineffective. With the primary excep-
tion of the quasi-experimental literature investigating intergroup trust
and forgiveness,17 the literatures emphasize theory, best practices, and
criticism, with an emphasis on practical applications. Intervention
studies look at the role(s) of civil society (Posner, 2004; Pouligny, 2005;
Paffenholz, 2009; Duthie, 2009; Pugh, 1998); forms of justice (Cobián
and Reátegui, 2009; Avruch and Vejarano, 2001; Lie, Binningsbø,
and Gates, 2006; De Greiff, 2009; Park, 2010); media and propaganda
(Bloomfield, Barnes, and Huyse, 2003; Krabil, 2001; Howard, 2002,
2003); and education (Bekerman, Zembylas, and McGlynn, 2009; Bar-
Tal, 2000; Danesh, 2006; Salomon, 2004).
All of these programs promote social reconciliation and build
positive social capital—by increasing communication and informa-
tion, encouraging direct contact, restructuring social values and norms
of behavior, providing common goals, and improving civic activism.
The roles and impacts of each are discussed in greater detail later in this
chapter; they are only briefly overviewed here.
Justice. Transitional justice—post-conflict retributive and restor-
ative justice—is the largest component of the social reconciliation lit-
erature and enjoys the most attention in the literature on post-conflict
recovery.
The literature on post-conflict justice is divided mainly among
overviews of transitional justice (Deutsch, 2000b; Elster, 2004; Lie,
Binningsbø, and Gates, 2006); assessments of the value of retributive
and restorative justice (Lundy and McGovern, 2008; Wilson, 2001;
Park, 2010); and case-studies of specific transitional justice processes
202 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
that discuss operational or tactical successes and shortcomings (Zorbas,
2004; Mitton, 2009; Megawalu and Loizides, 2010; Gibson, 2002).
However, there is little agreement about proper forms of justice or
implementation for promoting stability.18 There is some statistical evi-
dence that formal justice mechanisms (as distinct from amnesty deals)
are positively associated with longer peacetimes (Lie, Binningsbø, and
Gates, 2006; Sikkink and Booth Walling, 2007). The relationships are
not clear-cut, however, and there may be some optimal combination
of transitional justice tools that includes both amnesty and tribunals.
The issue of justice is taken up in greater detail below.
Civil Society. Promoting engagement by building up “civil soci-
ety” has been suggested as a new and beneficial strategy for post-conflict
peacebuilding in situations where states lack capacity to provide ser-
vices and maintain order (Parver and Wolf, 2008). Several studies have
assessed the success or failure of specific programs or organizations
related to civil society (e.g., Anckermann et al., 2005; Ager, Strang, and
Abebe, 2005). A few empirical studies assess the effectiveness of these
programs overall, as do a very few notable ones outside the narrow
intergroup trust literature. Most of these studies use survey data to
assess how community programs affect community cohesion among
members of different groups (Widner, 2004; Ajukovic, 2008; Whitt,
2010; Brune and Bossert, 2009) Some empirical work has tested the
effect of civil society on trust and general development, with mixed
results (Newton, 2001; Knack and Keefer, 1997). This is discussed
more in a later section.
Others. Overwhelmingly, the post-conflict intervention litera-
tures have been devoted to transitional justice, and—more recently—
to the potential for civil society to promote social capital and cohe-
sion. However, there are small and growing bodies of knowledge about
communication methods and education programs. The use of strate-
gic media and public communication between groups has been shown
to have potentially large effects on intergroup trust and cooperation
(Deutsch, 1958; Kerr et al., 1997; Sally, 1995; Balliet, 2009). Indeed,
meta-analyses have demonstrated this empirically (Sally, 1995; Balliet
2009). Education, also, has been shown to improve intergroup atti-
tudes toward one another, and promote intergroup cooperation and
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 203
trust (Bar-Tal, 2004; McGlynn, Niens, and Hewstone, 2004). These
programs are also discussed in greater detail below.
A Composite Picture
There is still a great deal more to be done in theorizing and examin-
ing the process of social reconstruction in a post-conflict environment.
However, based on the literature review, we see social reconstruction as
involving both reconciliation and the buildup of positive social capital.
Cooperation and trust, however, contribute to both reconciliation and
social capital.
We next examine some of the main programs or interventions
that have been identified in the theoretical and practitioner’s literature
as means of rebuilding trust, promoting positive social capital devel-
opment, and promoting social reconciliation in post-conflict situa-
tions. Two subsections examine transitional retributive and restorative
justice, respectively. The next subsection looks at the development of
civil-society organizations as a means of enhancing state functions,
improving civic participation, and encouraging local ownership of
development projects. A subsection then deals with the use of media
for improving social across-group attitudes, reinforcing cultural nar-
ratives, and disseminating information. That is followed by a subsec-
tion addressing the use of education to alter cultural tolerance for vio-
lence and modes of conflict and restructure cultural relationships to be
inclusive and cohesive. Finally, a subsection describes ways in which
these various interventions can interact with reinforcing feedbacks.
Policy Mechanisms for Social Reconstruction
Transitional Justice
Scholars and practitioners alike assert the need for justice to serve
multiple purposes beyond its mandate in international law. Victims
demand recognition and acknowledgement of their suffering, as well as
moral condemnation of the perpetrators and retribution against them
(Ajdukovic, 2008). Justice processes help establish a basis on which
members of the group can interact as human equals, a necessity of trust-
204 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
building encounters (Hofstede, 1991). Post-conflict justice, sometimes
called “transitional” justice, has received much attention and is widely
considered a necessary step in post-conflict reconciliation (Bloomfield,
Barnes and Huyse, 2003; Gaertner et al., 2005; Rotberg, 2000).19
Appropriate and feasible forms of justice, however, are very con-
text-dependent (Bloomfield, Barnes, and Huyse, 2003). Significantly,
transitional justice can involve any or all of several very different types
of process. These are sometimes called retributive justice, restorative jus
tice, and reconciliation (Clark, 2008). On one end of the spectrum lies
war crime trials, often international, for bringing major perpetrators
of violence to justice. On the other end are such mechanisms as truth
commissions, apology, and restitution. The relative merits of each are
subject to debate. 20 It is certainly the case that the choice of transitional
justice mechanisms in any context will require a serious examination of
the politically and socially feasible options.
With this background, what follows draws on the literature relat-
ing to transitional justice mechanisms. The focus is on formal trials
and truth commissions, as they are the common forms of transitional
justice, but also includes other options, such as lustration, restitution,
and hybrid courts; it goes beyond the experience of S&R operations.
Retributive Justice: Trials, Hybrid Courts, and Lustration. Pros-
ecution of war criminals and perpetrators of human rights atrocities in
the post-conflict setting has the potential to satisfy the societal demand
for justice. A number of authors cite the need for retributive justice
to stop potential instances of destabilizing vigilante or private justice
(Elster, 2004; Bass, 2005). Indeed, failure to have such processes can
cause difficulties. In Bosnia, for example, the failure of the Bosnian-
Serbs to turn over war criminals wanted by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has tended to undercut
trust between the ethnic groups. However, there is not universal agree-
ment about the value of retributive justice, as actually conducted. Clark
(2008), for example, uses empirical data gathered in the former Yugo-
slavia to argue that, while war-crime tribunals are an important part of
the peacebuilding process, the retributive justice they deliver falls seri-
ously short in promoting reconciliation—in significant part because
alternative narratives exist and persist about what constitutes justice.
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 205
Well-managed retributive justice allows governments to blame
individuals (rather than whole identity groups), purge threatening
figureheads, and enhance state legitimacy and expectations of rule of
law (Dobbins et al., 2007). Formal trials have been relatively scarce in
the realm of post-conflict reconstruction; there have been only eight
international war crimes tribunals since 1919. Compare this with truth
commissions, of which there have been 27 since 1971. The scarcity
of war tribunals suggests that there are far fewer situations in which
they are appropriate and feasible. Retributive justice is most feasible
(whether or not desirable) primarily when one side has had a decisive
victory, or when intervenors have the ability and will to crush one or
more of the contending parties. The Nuremberg Trials after World
War II were an example. A more recent example is the work of the
ICTY, created by the United Nations in 1993. And, of course, the Iraqi
Special Tribunal (a construct of the Iraqi government, not the United
Nations) had Saddam Hussein hanged in 2006.
Another emerging alternative has been the establishment of
“hybrid” courts, or courts operating within the country and adminis-
tered by local judicial authorities. Hybrid courts have a major advan-
tage of being potentially much less costly than war-crimes trials. 21 In
addition, they have the potential to support judicial capacity-building
and to demonstrate rule of law and fairness at the local level (Dob-
bins et al., 2007). The Rwandan Gacaca courts, or “grass” courts, were
established with the authority to mete out punishment and require
those found guilty to make restitution. Based on a traditional system
of justice, the courts were conducted quickly with few resources. Fur-
ther, because they used a traditional system, they enjoyed relatively
wide acceptance by Rwandans as legitimate and fair (Zorbas, 2004).
The level of retributive justice delivered in a post-conflict environ-
ment varies between the theoretical extremes of complete impunity
or punishment for all perpetrators. A notable in-between is lustration,
which deprives certain segments of the population access to power or
privileges; it is designed to ensure that those previously in power do not
regain access to the system (Dobbins et al., 2007). Notable examples
are Democrats after the American Civil War, members of the Nazi
party in post-World War II Germany, and members of the Ba’ath party
206 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
in Iraq. Lustration is administratively easier than individual prosecu-
tion since it requires no proof of wrongdoing and the burden of proof
for redress lies with the individual, not the government (Dobbins et al.,
2007). Yet to ameliorate the effects of its necessarily arbitrary design, an
apparatus capable of providing a path for reinstatement of the excluded
population is necessary (Dobbins et al., 2007).
In the post-conflict situations most relevant to S&R, negotiations
between opposing factions are taking place. In those situations, the pri-
mary objective is compromise and cooptation, not retribution. In this
case, reconciliation measures such as apology and restitution—such
as economic support to victims—may be more immediately imple-
mentable. Retribution may come decades later, as it did with Argentina
and Chile belatedly facing up to their pasts, but it will seldom be the
focus of S&R activities. Some will see a moral dilemma, as when nego-
tiations are attempted between the Afghan government and selected
elements of the Taliban, but putting aside retribution is perhaps neces-
sary if complete victory is not in the cards. If negotiations are necessary
between groups, then retributive justice mechanisms may be deferred,
weakened, or narrowed in scope. 22
Restorative Justice: Truth Commissions. Many scholars believe
that restorative justice is the stronger and most generally feasible
approach. Truth commissions generally act as complements rather
than alternatives to retributive justice where the latter is feasible. 23 At
root, truth commissions involve a cooperative effort to establish the
facts of history to overcome competing group narratives of the war,
narratives that often impede reconciliation and cooperation. Unlike
criminal trials, they do not involve prosecution of individuals, but
rather constitute an effort to set the record straight. Such programs
are normally conceived as having four main objectives: reconciliation,
accountability, truth-telling, and restitution for damage (Huyse and
Salter, 2008). South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC) is the most well known and is generally to be considered the
largest success of historical truth commissions, but commissions have
been implemented in many other situations with varying degrees of
success—e.g., Rwanda, Peru, Liberia, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 207
Truth commissions are officially empowered by the state to act
over a set period, usually six months to two years, and investigate
human rights abuses occurring over a predetermined period of time
(Dobbins et al., 2007). The commissions systematically uncover and
publicize the personal narratives of a country’s past war period, gener-
ally culminating in a final report of findings. Truth commissions sup-
port social reconciliation and provide an avenue for direct participation
by a large number of individuals (Dobbins et al., 2007). Truth-telling
allows survivors, perpetrators, and victims alike to reenact past vio-
lence, wherein grudges, bitterness, and pain can be conveyed without
the risk of inciting new cycles of violence (Huyse and Salter, 2008).
Because the core of their mission is on fact-finding and not punish-
ment, truth commissions are in a unique position to investigate collec-
tive guilt in a way that criminal trials or tribunals cannot (Bloomfield,
Barnes, and Huyse, 2003).
Truth-telling, apology, and acceptance of blame together combat
the tendency toward dehumanization of the other group and build a
foundation on which each group can begin to see the other as humans
rather than subhuman enemies. This helps establish a basis on which
members of the group can interact as human equals, a necessity of
trust-building. Establishing a valid historical narrative of past atrocities
legitimizes the pain of individuals and entire societies and condemns
the use of violence in the future. In the South African case, the truth
commission centered its energies on collecting and publicizing personal
testimonies of violence and war, to create an authoritative memory and
to fight against a collective amnesia for the future (Henderson, 2000).
It is clear that thoughtful and strategic planning needs to be
brought to bear on the organization of truth commissions and other
restorative justice measures so that they have meaningful impact. A
careful analysis of the cultural setting and other contextual factors will
be a must, in addition to interacting transitional justice with other
trust-building initiatives.
Other Mechanisms: Apology and Restitution. Truth-commis-
sion narratives sometimes also involve apology and announcements
of remorse, although apologies and restitution to victims need not
come via truth commissions. Apologies have powerful social import:
208 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Although they cannot undo past wrongs, they can help to undo some
of the damage of past wrongs by delegitimizing them (Tavuchis, 1991).
Some authors argue that reconciliation efforts without any form of
apology cannot hope to succeed (Smits, 2003). Public acts of contri-
tion and apology can help build trust, especially when the act is costly,
either socially, politically, or economically, for the contrite party (Pruitt
and Olczak, 1995). 24 Apologies that are qualified, appear insincere, or
are inconsistent with the apologizer’s behavior will irritate conflict and
reduce cooperative drives; unfelt apologies are better left unsaid.
Restitution for victims can also serve this function at the societal
level as well as the individual level, while also promoting a more equal
society in general (Huyse and Salter, 2008). Similar to procedural post-
conflict justice, providing accountability and the equitable provision of
restitution should also enhance the credibility of the justice-dispensing
body, which increases vertical levels of trust in the new government.
Overall Cautions. All justice mechanisms—whether retribu-
tive or restorative—will be judged by the company they keep. While
hybrid courts and national truth-finding commissions—for example,
truth and reconciliation commissions in both South Africa and Sierra
Leone—may gain legal authority to conduct their investigations via
legislative or constitutional mandates, they do not necessarily gain
legitimacy or credibility from these same sources. Tribunals and com-
missions supported or run by actors that took part in the atrocities, or
actors who are seen as partial or weak, will hamper the impact of the
commission’s work. This was the case in Rwanda: Because the church
took part in some of the wartime atrocities, its involvement with the
Gacaca “grass” courts was an unwelcome signal that the impartiality of
the courts might be compromised (Parver and Wolf, 2008).
Another operational caveat lies in offering amnesty or economic
assistance in exchange for information, truth-telling, or laying down
arms. While amnesty has been relatively successful in getting perpetra-
tors to come forward for the purposes of truth commissions, it has not
worked universally, and it is unclear whether more-violent perpetrators
are more or less likely to step forward. On the one hand, amnesties may
be the price of peace; on the other hand, they can deepen resentment
among victims and society (Gibson, 2002; Wilson, 2001). Trade-offs
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 209
between amnesty and trials and prosecutions—or, in the case of truth
commissions, incomplete accounts of the past—will have to be made.
Amnesty will promote reconstruction by incentivizing fighters to put
down arms and come forward. Yet, amnesty undermines retributive
justice goals and may lead to feelings in society that perpetrators got
off scot-free.
An important conclusion from the literature is that in all types of
post conflict justice, as in so many other areas, local ownership matters.
International and local norms of justice are not the same. A danger of
putting justice in the hands of third parties is that outcomes will fail
to fulfill culturally defined modes of justice and therefore be poorly
accepted. Or, they may appear to be politically partial, fueling distrust
and animosity toward the other side (Parver and Wolf, 2008). Link-
ing justice mechanisms to traditional or indigenous forms of justice
brings the process close to home for many and imparts a sense of local
legitimacy. Moreover, locals are often better equipped than external
agents to understand what their community needs to bury memories
of past atrocities. However, international third parties need to ensure
the safety of both victims and confessed perpetrators. If international
actors enjoy perceptions of nonbias and credibility, they can also give
their imprimatur process to help legitimize justice efforts.
In this view, international agents are best advised to be support-
ers of the local process, rather than administrators themselves. Giving
room for local social and legal structures to enforce justice contributes
to the legitimacy of the justice process and enhances indigenous gov-
ernance structures, provided that the justice-implementing organiza-
tions are nonbiased and perceived to be so. They can help by providing
manpower, resources, and facilities and advising on international legal
requirements in the context of local justice. To be sure, local justice
mechanisms are not always appropriate, or in accordance with interna-
tional humanitarian standards. International third parties must make
sure that humanitarian standards are upheld, and compromises may
have to occur for both local justice and international requirements to
be satisfied. Attempting to do so can raise dilemmas.
Overall, the forms of justice that occur in the post-conflict period
are largely dependent on what is both acceptable by the population
210 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
and feasible politically. If retributive justice is not an available option,
then intervenors may depend on other reconciliation measures. This
does not mean, however, that some form of reconciliation is not neces-
sary for societies to move on in the longer term. Though Panama and
Uruguay did not institute their own truth commissions until decades
after the cessation of the conflicts they were mandated to investigate,
the commissions were still needed to “bury the hatchet” on these con-
flicts. At the end of the day, the purpose of transitional justice is to help
societies move on as a whole, rather than continue to hold onto the past
conflict as a source of division.
Efforts to Develop Civil Society
The literature has substantial discussion of the value of civil society
in post-conflict reconstruction, as reviewed by Paffenholz and Spurk
(2006). The nature and functions of civil society in the literature
include protecting citizen’s rights, monitoring government, building
community through engagement and socialization, delivering services,
and mediating between citizens and the state (Paffenholz and Spurk,
2006; Parver and Wolf, 2008; World Bank, 2005). Civil society is often
viewed as an alternative to weak, post-conflict states for the provision
of public goods. Moreover, civil society can, in theory, build social
capital and trust through civic engagement while forcing the govern-
ment to become more transparent and accountable. To the extent that
community organizations understand the needs of their communities,
they can also help prioritize programs by providing contextual insights
and adding legitimacy to both external and state partners.
Civil society organizations can promulgate social reconciliation
in several ways. By providing services equitably they can satisfy needs
and, in the process, reduce insecurity and competitiveness. As watch-
dogs and public-information providers, they can increase knowledge
and reduce uncertainty. As organizers, they can stimulate intergroup
cooperation and the accumulation of trust—for example, by bring-
ing together adversarial groups and help identify common goals.
Thus, they can help bolster nearly all of the dimensions of social capi-
tal identified by the World Bank (2006) and outlined in Table 5.3.
Nor is such discussion purely speculative. Fearon, Humphreys, and
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 211
Weinstein (2009) have shown that the development of civil society in
post-conflict communities alters patterns of social cooperation. Several
case studies undertaken by the World Bank evaluating community-
driven development in conflict areas suggest that, in certain contexts,
joint-development programs improve civic participation (especially
in youth), restore trust in mixed communities, and promote stability
(World Bank, 2006).
Furthermore, besides building positive social capital, the sheer
presence of community civil organizations acts as an integrative agent
within the community, bringing people together outside of the home
(Putnam, 1993, 1995)—perhaps across communities (“bridging” as
well as “bonding”). As such, the sheer presence of civil society organiza-
tions can create a sense of community inclusiveness that promotes both
direct and indirect contact. Although, to date, civil society organiza-
tions have been mainly talked about and evaluated in the context of
development-assistance programs, the discussion here clearly suggests
that they can be useful in promoting stabilization and reconstruction.
Cautions. There are also obvious problems and challenges involved
with efforts to develop civil society.
1. Limited Reach. Efforts aimed specifically at promoting social
harmony and attitudinal change often fail to reach large enough
numbers of people to support social change (Paffenholz and
Spurk, 2006).
2. Lack of Sustainability. International investments in civil society
tend to be short-sighted and persist only as long as international
engagement (World Bank, 2005; Donais, 2009). Thereafter, old
patterns reemerge (Fearon, Humphreys, and Weinstein, 2009).
3. Identifying Whom to Support. Identifying the significant and
appropriate actors to support can be problematic (Pouligny,
2005; World Bank, 2005), in part because a myriad of organi-
zations may exist. Some may be politically motivated or mar-
ginalizing, such as organizations that operate exclusive pro-
grams along ethnic, gender, political or other lines; some will
arise merely because of the prospect of donor funding; some
deal with health, others with political advocacy, and still others
212 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
with education; even worse, some may seek to undermine the
intervention itself by funneling money to insurgents, a problem
in today’s Afghanistan (Goodhand and Sedra, 2010).
4. Capability of Civic Organizations. The qualitative characteris-
tics of organizations matter, not just their number. Many civil
society organizations lack the absorptive capacity to collect and
distribute aid in the same way that state bodies can (for the
example of Sierra Leone, see Mitton, 2009).
5. Undermining of Government. In some cases, investments in civil
society can undermine government authority or legitimacy,
thereby contributing to long-run state weakness (World Bank,
2005). When the state is weak, civil society has the potential to
overpower it (Burde, 2004) and to undercut intervenors’ efforts
to strengthen the state.
One lesson might seem to be that civil society organizations
should provide services that are complementary rather than supple-
mentary to state services, so as to avoid undermining state legitimacy.
Thus, the organizations should be partnered with government rather
than sidestepping or subverting it. That is not always possible, however,
as discussed in Chapter Seven. Further, in the extreme it presupposes
the desirability of a strong state system rather than one that is more
decentralized.
Another lesson from the literature is that external actors must be
and appear even-handed in their support for civic organizations, espe-
cially when it comes to those closely associated with particular groups
that were once party to the conflict.
On the difficult issue of how to choose which groups to sup-
port, there is no simple formula for guidance. However, it would seem
that external support should go to organizations whose core mission
includes providing locally oriented, socially and economically inclusive
programs that promote nonviolence.
Media and Communication
Communication can improve understanding of issues and relation-
ships, enhance positive aspects of identity, and generate norms of
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 213
cooperation (Kerr et al., 1997). It can frame the course of interper-
sonal interactions, analyze interests, diffuse mistrust, and provide safe
emotional outlets (Howard, 2002, p. 4). It can be a form of contact
between groups, which plays a role in breaking down negative stereo-
types. A professionalized media can improve cooperation by correcting
information asymmetries and mitigating distrust and competitiveness
(Kumar, 1999). Recently, the strategic use of media as a stability tool in
post-conflict states has moved from strict reporting to delivering a mes-
sage of peace, choosing information that has the potential to transform
conflict, and shifting identities and attitudes (Howard, 2002).
Communication can be either active—via speeches or declara-
tions of intent directed at members of other groups—or passive, via
subconscious priming of attitudes. For example, media programs in
Rwanda have included ethnically integrated cast members to improve
groups’ attitudes toward the other (Levy Paluck, 2007). The forms of
media are numerous and include traditional newspapers, radio, and
television programming with, increasingly, less expensive alternatives,
such as dialogue projects and social media.
Strategic development of an independent media can be a tool
for social reconstruction in several ways. The media can be used to
spread messages of peace, reconciliation, and solidarity that reinforce
other trust-building programs. Media can be a form of indirect con-
tact between groups, as well as a medium for subconsciously challeng-
ing social attitudes. Media can disseminate messages of reconciliation,
peace, and apology from one group to another, which aids trust for-
mation. There is evidence to suggest that integrated media encourages
social reconciliation (Levy Paluck, 2007). For example, research in
Rwanda finds that reconciliation media has potential to affect percep-
tions and social norms, as well as attitudes about trust, integration, and
truth (Levy Paluck, 2007).
Sequencing. In developing professional media in post-conflict
environments, sequencing appears to be important. One study
(Howard, 2002) suggests that media development needs to start with
basic skills training in reporting and objectivity. Focus should then
transition to building norms of independence and professionalism,
which enhance both quality and credibility. Only later in development
214 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
should the media be used for disseminating messages seeking to change
attitudes. In all of this, long-term commitment is necessary if self-sus-
taining results are desired (Howard 2002, 2003; Kumar, 1999). Bosnia
is a case in point: The Organization for Security and Cooperation was
successful in building a free and independent media. However, many
media outlets later ran into difficulty financially, and in the struggle to
survive were forced into the arms of partisan groups.
Cautions. Despite the potential for good, many issues, problems,
and dilemmas exist.
1. Sensationalism Sells. A truly free and independent media in post-
conflict states has the potential to negatively impact peace and
trust. Excess attention to incidents of intergroup violence and
the need for simple, easily packaged ideas that rob situations of
their complexity can easily be detrimental (Howard, 2003). To
make thing worse, examples of positive cooperation or peaceful
negotiations are relatively less exciting and are therefore under-
represented. This overreporting of negative events and under-
reporting of positive ones can severely affect perceptions of the
situation.
It follows that to serve the functions of peace, media will
require direction and guidance. Messages of peace must be
actively disseminated, and journalists should be trained with an
eye to emphasize peace-promoting media over sensationalist or
conflict media (Lynch and McGoldrick, 2005). Accomplishing
this is not straightforward, especially when such “direction” can
undercut independence and credibility.
2. Misunderstanding and Misappropriation. Another problem is
that communications can be misinterpreted, and the media
can be used as a conduit for identity politicians to exploit.
Unclear, vague, or antagonistic communication across groups
can increase suspicion and distrust (Howard, 2003). An even
worse outcome would be the use of a newly instantiated media
network by identity politicians to fuel intergroup competition,
spread malicious ethnic myths, and reinforce negative stereo-
types. Political entrepreneurs often use sensational media to
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 215
reinforce negative stereotypes and enforce distrust between
groups for their own political gain. Highly uncertain environ-
ments, such as those that characterize post-conflict situations,
increase the willingness of individuals to accept such messages
(Lake and Rothchild, 1996; Weingast, 1998).
It is clear, then, that while the media can have a potentially huge
impact, it can be for good or bad. More research on such matters is
needed so as to establish best practices for intervenors to work with.
Peace Education
The essential goal of peace education is to increase understanding
and mutual respect between groups engaged in protracted conflict by
acquiring “beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that are in line with the
ideas of coexistence” (Bar-Tal, 2004, p. 261). Through learning about
and empathizing with other groups, people engage in a collective pro-
cess of attitude change and belief restructuring. The intent is to change
a group’s narratives by (1) legitimizing the group’s own narrative,
(2) examining the group’s own contribution to the conflict, (3) learn-
ing empathy for other groups’ suffering, and (4) promoting intergroup
engagement in nonviolent activities (Salomon, 2004). Overall, the con-
cept of peace education centers on the process of de-essentialization of
one’s own group identity and humanization of the perception of other
groups (Bekerman, Zembylas, and McGlynn, 2009).
How does peace education contribute to social reconstruction?
Peace education contributes to intergroup trust by (1) establishing
an arena for mutually respectful, equal-status contact between group
members under the authority of an impartial third party (the teacher or
administrator); (2) emphasizing the legitimacy of the cultural heritage
of others and molding identity narratives; (3) building empathy for
the suffering of the other groups in the conflict; (4) encouraging the
acceptance of one’s own role in the conflict. Peace education attempts
to draw experiential parallels between the histories of the two groups,
thus identifying the similarities between them. This builds a basis for
empathy and cross-group identification.
216 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Peace education programs can be centered around either the
formal schooling system or the society at large. Recognizing that the
school system is a major agent of socialization for youth, desegregated,
school-based peace education approaches have been tried in Israel and
in universities in Northern Ireland. The societal approach also includes
political, social, and cultural institutions and both leaders and elites.
The societal approach is tactically much more involved and requires
credible institutional support, the cooperation of agents from all areas
of society, and that new norms are developed conjointly between
groups (Bar-Tal, 2004).
The efficacy of school-based peace education in altering youth ori-
entations to problem-solving and conflict is generally positive. While
schooling alone has surprisingly little impact on specific issues, it seems
to have a large positive impact in influencing the general orientation to
problems, such as open-mindedness or predisposition to make judg-
ments (McGuire, 1998). In accordance with this, Salomon (2004)
finds that peace education in Israel, despite the ongoing violence, yields
positive effects regarding the willingness of Israeli-Jewish and Palestin-
ian youngsters to view a problem from multiple angles and engage in
contact with members of other groups, but does not generally affect
their specific political views. Yet another study (McGlynn, Niens, and
Hewstone, 2004) summarizes several studies on the impact of inte-
grated education in Northern Ireland and elsewhere and concludes that
integrated education positively impacts identity, attitudes toward the
outgroup, forgiveness, and reconciliation. The authors argue that the
Northern Ireland success provides hope for other attempts at co-educa-
tion to assuage legacies of violent conflict.
The effectiveness of the broader, social approach has not been
assessed. The social approach obviously calls for a massive level of coor-
dinated effort and cooperation, and it is by no means clear that politi-
cally competitive or adversarial agents in government, civil society, and
international parties will be able to effectively coordinate and manage
priorities where states are too weak to manage the effort alone.
Cautions. A number of cautions also need to be expressed:
1. A unified, committed leadership that can agree on and coordi-
nate the continual dissemination of messages seems to be nec-
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 217
essary. Achieving such a unified position among elites of a war-
torn country may, however, be nigh impossible.
2. The state must be prepared to take on the role as the main source
of socialization. This may also be difficult to achieve. In the
past, families and communities have traditionally been the main
socializers of children in many post-conflict environments—
e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, Indonesia, and Afghanistan. Families
may be loathe to allow their children to attend a school where
they believe their children will be taught to love people with
whom they have been in such devastating conflict.
3. Although the literature to date is optimistic about the effects of
peace education, most studies have dealt with relatively high-
income countries that are either experiencing long-term pro-
tracted conflict (Cyprus, Israel) or have had a relatively success-
ful peace for more than a decade (Northern Ireland). Northern
Ireland and Israel are unusually wealthy compared with other
post-conflict countries. It is uncertain how viable peace educa-
tion will be in post-conflict states where other more basic needs
are lacking.
Linkages
The reciprocal, self-reinforcing nature of social reconciliation, coop-
eration, trust, and social capital suggests “cocktail effects” in which
the overall benefits to trust-building from several social programs
can be significantly more than the sum of the programs’ individual
values. Also, the benefits to political and economic development can
be improved by encouraging a variety of different interventions. For
example, Mitton (2009) describes an instance in Sierra Leone in which
the National Youth Council lobbied the government to establish a
National Youth Commission, as part of the peace agreement. When
the government was unresponsive, the council threatened to establish
one independently, a move that received massive media attention and
elicited a large public response. The Sierra Leonean government acqui-
esced and established the commission. Here, the ability of civil society
to improve government responsiveness was enhanced by media cover-
age. Another example, given by Krabil (2001), is of the media coverage
of the truth commission in South Africa. Media exposure of the truth
218 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
commission spread the message of justice to a much larger number of
people and brought the process of justice and reconciliation closer for
many than would have been possible otherwise. Civil society organiza-
tions also helped contribute to the effectiveness of the commission by
providing local information and support. Reciprocally, the truth com-
mission improved perceptions of state legitimacy by providing legiti-
mate local channels of conflict resolution and mediation.
There is, in general, a substantial potential for such synergies in
S&R. For example, imagine a situation in which civil-society orga-
nizations that deliver health services increase trust and social capital,
which in turn strengthens the ability of the local watchdog agency to
monitor government responsiveness, whose findings are relayed via the
local media, which moves government to act, which increases percep-
tions of government legitimacy, which increases security and decreases
mistrust, which promotes more cooperation. Another example might
be a situation in which peace education socializes young people to have
more accepting attitudes and brings integrated media programs into
the home, where they have an opportunity to affect parents and other
adults. Figure 5.4 illustrates potential linkages among the social inter-
ventions discussed in this chapter.
Such reinforcing effects are not limited to processes within the
social sphere. Social development can have positive effects on economic
and political development and vice versa, a theme of the entire volume
that will not be repeated here. 25
Integrative Considerations and Discussion
Context-Specificity
Any successful cohesion-building program will benefit from an acute
awareness of social dynamics, power structures, cultural narratives and
identities, and local political economy—evidence again of the impor-
tance of local knowledge to successful post-conflict S&R. There is a
great deal of variation in post-conflict situations. As examples, the chal-
lenges in Rwanda and Cambodia have been very different (e.g., with
no groups to reconcile in Cambodia). Even understandings of trust
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 219
and trustworthiness are culturally rooted and context-specific (Brune
and Bossert, 2009). All post-conflict situations are influenced by their
own political-economic and socio-cultural histories, which is why
local ownership is so important. Donors and external actors, of course,
often have difficulty escaping their own cultural frames (Donais, 2009;
Pouligny, 2005).
Context specificity, by definition, means that no specific policy rec
ommendations will work for all, or perhaps more than any one, situation.
Therefore, there seems to be a great need for developing frame-
works or approaches to developing programs that allow for the satisfac-
tion of social development goals by context-appropriate means, rather
than on the identification of specific programmatic forms for use in
many situations.

220 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Sequencing of Trust-and-Cooperation-Relevant Interventions
While there is no clear-cut timeline for implementing social interven-
tions in the post-conflict period, some recommendations for sequenc-
ing of programs emerge from the literature. 26 Transitional justice,
both retributive and restorative, cannot wait. Transitional justice
mechanisms are consistently identified as paramount for post-conflict
social reconciliation (Bloomfield, Barnes, and Huyse, 2003; Avruch
and Vejarano, 2001; Cuevas, Rojas, and Baeza, 2002; Rotberg, 2000;
Lundy and McGovern, 2008). Social reconciliation lays the foundation
for the reconstruction of healthy social relationships characterized by
cooperation. The details of violent experiences tend to fade fast (even if
emotional memory remains strong), so getting individuals’ stories into
the record as quickly and accurately as possible is important. Retribu-
tive justice is logistically harder and takes more time due to the bureau-
cracy involved in trying prisoners, yet international actors should not
hesitate to make clear steps toward implementing formal trials and tri-
bunals. Victims demand retribution, and a delay in providing it will
only increase dissatisfaction.
Public and frequent communication between groups in the imme-
diate post-conflict period can also be an aid to developing initial levels
of post-conflict cooperation (see earlier discussion of “thin” trust). A
well-negotiated peace agreement can be a good jumping-off point for
reiterating messages of cooperation, tolerance, and unity. Elites can
have a very positive role in directing expectations via frequent, respect-
ful communication.
Peace education programs, as previously noted, are clearly long-
term prospects requiring unified leadership and infrastructure that
may be very difficult to come by, and they divert resources away from
more-effective interventions in the short term. Developing a profes-
sional media with a mission of promoting nonviolence and stability can
be a good way to start moving toward a societal peace education pro-
gram, by laying the foundation for the future dissemination of peace
messages. Furthermore, the media can provide immediate benefits by
increasing information in an insecure, information-scarce environ-
ment. A professional media that may be used as a tool for projecting
information and positive messages can yield large and immediate ben-
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 221
efits for S&R, as long as caution is taken to make sure that journalists
are not seen as puppets of the intervenors.
Civil society is likely to be lacking in post-conflict situations.
There is no clear recommendation for when and how to get involved
with promoting civil society organizations. Benefits can be accrued in
the short term if there are already some organizations that are capable
of providing equal-access, inclusive, and stabilizing services that can
partner with external agents. However, external agents should not be
tempted to support weak or partisan organizations out of a need to do
something; such efforts would be not only wasteful but also counter-
productive, as discussed earlier.
Overall, some basic level of security needs to be established in
order for social reconstruction to take place. In societies struggling
with deep emotional turmoil and severely depleted social capital, the
best intervenors can hope for at the beginning is cooperation motivated
by “thin” trust. If intervenors cannot guarantee some security, includ-
ing enforcement mechanisms, cooperation will be unlikely to occur at
all, and social construction will be difficult to proceed with.
Local Ownership and Legitimacy
Local ownership of reconstruction processes has been routinely identi-
fied in the reconstruction literature as a necessity for successful peace
(Donais, 2009; Goodhand and Sedra, 2010; Duthie, 2009). Local
ownership of projects and processes builds endogenous social capital,
establishes procedural legitimacy, aligns projects to needs more effi-
ciently, and improves community cooperation and collective action.
Additionally, local ownership can help build local capacity to run pro-
grams when intervenors leave. Local authority also often enjoys greater
legitimacy and confidence with citizens than external actors. Yet, there
is still a dichotomy between rhetoric and practice in international inter-
vention in post-conflict states.
The very notion of ownership is contested in some places, and
donors have to negotiate with and choose among multiple state and
nonstate interlocutors (Goodhand and Sedra, 2010).
The ownership issue is only one example of how differences in
norms can cause trouble, as expressed in the literature:
222 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
This disjuncture between the local and the international does not
only occur in relation to trust. . . . There is a danger that exter-
nally driven norms, practice, and expectations on trust are uni-
versalized, or assumed to have purchase in a wide range of societ-
ies. (Gormley-Heenan and MacGinty, 2009, p. 424)
The importation of external norms or institutions has a very short
track record of success. When survivors do not have a stake in adjust-
ments, they also lose incentives to perpetuate those changes (Pugh,
1998). In a space where debate on types of interventions, methods,
and philosophy are still ongoing, there is overwhelming agreement that
social capital cannot be developed externally; rather, processes of trust
and social development must happen organically. Hence, it is argued
that the best way for international actors to engage is in a support-
ive and/or consultative role rather than a directorial or leadership one
(World Bank, 2005; Donais, 2009; Pugh, 1998).
Cautions. As noted in the discussions of justice, despite these
broad conclusions, intervenors cannot leave everything in the hands
of locals. A prime example is that of post-conflict justice. International
humanitarian law demands that war crimes be prosecuted, yet local
governments have sometimes sought to provide amnesty to leaders in
order to guarantee a peace. Conversely, external actors may wish to
guarantee that local justice complies with minimum standards of inter-
national justice. Some local definitions of justice are not only consid-
ered extremely harsh but are in violation of international humanitar-
ian norms—such as those prohibiting cruel or unusual punishment
and those providing for equal protection (e.g., for women). 27 External
agents must walk a fine line between imposing external justice and
making sure their legal and humanitarian obligations are met.
Another less obvious example is that of providing support to civil
society organizations. While one goal of promoting the development
of civil society is to bring members of different groups together under
a common goal, imposing a standard of inclusion can be rejected by a
traditionally segregated society. This is turn undermines social capital
between the community and the peacekeepers, which makes maintain-
ing order more difficult. Yet, encouraging “local ownership” by allowing
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 223
civic organizations to deny access to membership or resources—such
as providing funding to an organization that administers community
health services only to members of certain groups, or that does not
take measures to ensure that services are accessible to underprivileged
groups—is antithetical to the goals of social reconstruction.
Yet it is important to remember that local ownership does not
guarantee success. There is no shortage of cases where reconstruction
efforts have failed to produce stability. As an example, the implementa-
tion of small government and conservative economic measures did not
cause stable economic growth in East Timor but rather mass urban-
ization, which led to a resurgence of violence. While the idea of local
ownership is highly supported in the literature, implementation that
retains local autonomy while still achieving reconstruction aims and
conforming to external parties’ humanitarian obligations is often more
difficult. In the end, trade-offs will have to be made depending on the
situation and context of each case.
Role of Elites
Elites can play an important, even crucial role in post-conflict S&R.
Popular leaders are highly visible symbols of the past, present, and
future. Leaders act as symbolic representations of the group they rep-
resent; they are assumed to speak on behalf of the group and to repre-
sent the group’s intentions and attitudes. As such, elites and leaders have
symbolic power to encourage (or enforce) acceptance of new norms of coop
eration and promote reconciliation. Turkey’s Mustafa Kemal Ataturk is
probably one of history’s most remarkable positive examples for having
created a modern nation and sense of nationality. 28
As role models and ideologues for situations torn by conflict, lead-
ers have the potential to dramatically affect the reconciliation process.
Elite apologies for past injustices have a profound effect on healing as
a collective apology from one group to another (Blatz, Schumann, and
Ross, 2009). An apology or expression of empathy by the leaders of one
group not only sets an example for others in the group itself, but also
encourages trust and reconciliation in members of other groups via the
social tendency for reciprocity. Additionally, with the power to speak
with authority for the group, leaders have the power to commit group
224 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
members to certain actions or behaviors, so long as they do not go so
far as to alienate the group.
Conversely, situations that are characterized by high levels of inse-
curity, as post-conflict situations tend to be, are ripe for exploitation by
ethno-nationalist politicians who would distort narratives and repre-
sentations to mobilize groups along identity lines (Brubaker and Laitin,
2005). Identity politicians often create dividing lines that pair ethnic,
social, or other identities with political ones, which increases competi-
tion and conflict among groups (d’Estree, 2003; Brubaker, 2009). The
significance of the power-structure aspects and related exploitation of
nationalism can be seen in a recent article (Wimmer and Feinstein,
2010).
Intervening third parties need to be especially mindful of the role
of charismatic leaders who would use the cleavages between groups to
mobilize political factions and take steps to mitigate their influence, by
promoting social reconciliation and service delivery.
Conclusions
Trust and larger social capital-building processes in post-conflict situa-
tions are vital to the transition to social stability, but difficult to design
and even more difficult to measure. They require long-term com-
mitments and a finessed balance between top-down and bottom-up
approaches; they can be undone by insufficient improvement(s) in the
economic, political, or security arenas. The actual effectiveness of vari-
ous types of interventions in the post-conflict setting is largely under-
studied. While much analysis has gone into understanding the tactical
components of war, there has been much less rigor in approaching the
tactical aspects of peace, perhaps partly due to the nontransferrable
nature of reconstruction and recovery programs across space and time
as well as to the relative nascence of modern, large-scale state-building
efforts.
Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all plan for determining
what programs are appropriate or how to implement them for the best
result. The success of cohesion-building interventions depends on tech-
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 225
nical implementation, program interactions, and such context-specific
factors as the strength of internal and international commitments. Suc-
cessful peacebuilding will depend on understanding interactions across
systems and monitoring-and-feedback systems that allow adjustment
of programs to meet evolving needs. Part of local ownership requires
including local actors and groups and listening responsively to their
counsel about needs and technical implementation.
Social reconciliation and cohesion-building programs can improve
social relations in post-conflict situations, but their contribution will
depend largely on resources, long-term strategy, process ownership,
and the overall network of interactions of political and economic struc-
tures within the social system.
Endnotes
1 A large and well-established literature exists on the dynamics of conflict pro-
cesses and factors that encourage cooperation over competition (Deutsch, 1958,
1973, 2000a; Lewicki and Weithoff, 2000; Hardin, 1995, Rubenstein, 2003a;
d’Estree, 2003).
2 A longer definition is “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept
vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of
another,” quoted in the recent review by Saunders et al. (2010, p. 10). However,
in normal parlance, to trust someone does not necessarily imply a personal vulner-
ability. One more strongly dissenting view about definitions comes from construc-
tionists who believe that trust should be seen strictly as a verb because it relates to
continuously changing relationships for which no stable state exists (Wright and
Ehnert, 2010).
3 Trust promotes cooperation, but cooperation then promotes future trust
(Deutsch, 1973; Bloomfield, Barnes, and Huyse, 2003).
4 The types discussed have included, in particular, deterrence-based, competence-
based, cognitive, calculus-based, knowledge-based, affective, identification-based,
empathy-based, and relational trust.
5 Some individuals count on or appeal to the natural trusting character of people.
That may be for either good or foul purposes. In post-conflict societies, however,
“natural trust” is not especially conspicuous.
6 It would be better to refer to “limited rationality,” since the judgments are affected
by misperceptions, lack of information, cognitive biases, and the idiosyncrasies of
226 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
leaders who may, for example, weigh risk avoidance much more than opportunity
creation, or vice versa. See also Chapter Two of this volume.
7 Such trust is enhanced when behavior on both sides is context-appropriate and
consistent, stated deadlines are met, and tasks are performed and followed through
as negotiated. Clear goals, expectations, timelines, and punishments for failure or
defection are important. Expectations must be reasonable, and, to avoid confusion
or misinterpretation, all expectations about behavior, measurement of goals, and
punishment for failure need to be explicitly stated beforehand. It may even be neces-
sary to explicitly negotiate expected behaviors. See Deutsch, 2000a, pp. 21–40, and
Lewicki and Weithoff, 2000, pp. 86–107.
8 Making the distinction is both more descriptive generally and is important in
discussing levels of trust and distrust simultaneously in the context of S&R. After
all, a universal feature of post-conflict societies is “the pervasiveness of antagonism,
mistrust, and hostility” (Kumar, 1999, p. v).
9 It is noteworthy that the elites in power after World War II were not the same, in
Germany in particular, as before or during the war. If the same individuals as before
are in power in a post-conflict period, there may be less likelihood of building trust
and cooperation.
10 Social reconciliation generally refers to the healing that has to occur for former
enemy groups to build healthy relationships. Kelman (2008) describes it as “changes
in the ways in which former enemy populations think about each other, feel about
each other, and act toward one another, as they learn to live together” (p. 16). These
processes include arriving at a mutual group acceptance, healing, empathy, and
discovering a common past (Bloomfield, Barnes, and Huyse, 2003; cf. Lederach,
1997). Staub and Bar-Tal (2003, p. 733) include programs designed to promote
truth and justice, healing, forgiveness, and shared views of history. Kumar (1999)
lays out the goals of a social reconciliation program as (1) preventing the recur-
rence of conflict by facilitating communication and developing peace structures,
(2) reducing anger and prejudices vial reciprocal dialogue and cooperative action,
and (3) establishing positive relationships among conflicting parties. Because this
definition includes cooperative activities, it closely aligns with this chapter’s use of
the term social reconstruction.
11 The term constructed applies because the identities are often not objective real-
ities, but rather distinctions that emerge from (i.e., are constructed from) social
activities. Yes, an individual might objectively be from a particular ethnic origin,
but whether and how that matters to him and other people is constructed.
12 It is said that “lessons will be smothered by the more embracing norms of his
family, gang, or neighborhood” (Allport, 1954, p. 40).
13 It is not necessary that all members of the group change their personal attitudes
to achieve a change in collective social attitudes (Axelrod, 1984: cf. Schelling, 1973).
So, of course, the strength of social identities will vary; strong identities, such as
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 227
family and community identities, will exert a larger effect on personal attitudes and
behaviors than weaker ones, such as nation or political party. Often the identities
that matter most are those of family and friends. It follows logically that efforts to
identify “pockets” in which to seed attitude changes may be most effective if they
focus on points of authority, such as influential or charismatic leaders. Such cascade
effects can create or exacerbate tensions (as when ethnic or nationalistic themes
grow) or can improve relationships and cooperation (as, arguably, is now occurring
in the United States with respect to gays in the military).
14 David Kennedy is currently at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. A good
popular account of this program is Seabrook (2009).
15 Remarkably, moral arguments have salience if coming from respected people.
16 Contact theory enjoys widespread acceptance as an explanation for attitude
change—the (trans)formation of prejudice and negative attitudes. It was first devel-
oped by Williams (1947) and elaborated on and expanded by Allport (1954), Cook
(1978), Pettigrew (1998), Dovidio et al. (2003), Pettigrew and Tropp (2006), and
others, For an overview with applications to prejudice, see Allport’s seminal work
(Allport, 1954). The mechanism through which contact works is simple. Contact
between group members, given the right conditions, arouses cognitive dissonance
in the individual (Cook, 1978), and this generates a desire to reconcile the conflict
between their beliefs and their new information, in turn leading to a reassessment
of the validity of the stereotype (Festinger, 1957).
17 This refers to experiments that pass the usual tests for statistical experiments
except that they lack the feature of random assignment. For example, an interven-
tion may be made on one group while using a different but equivalent group as
a control. There may be tests before and after the intervention in both cases, but
statistical interpretation is more tentative than it would be if the subjects had been
randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Quasi-experimental designs
are sometimes referred to as “natural experiments.”
18 Very few studies empirically test assertions or hypothesis. Notable exceptions
are Mendelhoff (2009), Lie et al. (2006), Cuevas et al. (2002), and Başoğlu et al.
(2005). The results from these empirical analyses are mixed. Lie et al. (2006), for
example, find in favor of retributive justice, but find no support for truth-telling or
peace commissions. Mendelhoff (2009) finds no support that restorative justice aids
individual emotional recovery, but does not address recovery at the social level
19 An extensive bibliography on transitional justice has been compiled by Brandon
Hamber (2007).
20 See also The Beginner’s Guide to Nation Building, which is heavily informed by
practitioner experience and case histories (Dobbins et al., 2007, pp. 91–101). It dis-
cusses the practical benefits and perils of the implementation of several types of
transitional justice, including trials and truth commissions.
228 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
21 International war-crimes trials can be exceedingly time-consuming and costly.
As an example, since 1993 the ICTY mentioned in the text has successfully pros-
ecuted 161 individuals for war crimes, but has spent over $1.5 billion in the process
(ICTY, no date).
22 To illustrate, a quick analysis of the Uganda Survey of War Affected Youth
revealed that amnesty was a major predictive factor of whether or not former abduct-
ees visited a reception center for assistance.
23 For an excellent review on truth commissions, their effectiveness, and their his-
torical implementation, see Avruch and Vejarano, 2001.
24 A notable example of an effective public apology is Australian Prime Minister
Kevin Rudd’s apology for the Australian government’s historical mistreatment of
the Australian Aborigines, made in 2008. Although the apology was not accompa-
nied by reparations, it was nevertheless very well received by Aborigines and white
Australians. Even after long periods, apology can relieve tensions between groups
(although not eliminate them).
25 As examples, increased trust and social capital make economic interactions more
likely. Higher levels of economic activity in turn increase incentives for entrepre-
neurs to form civil organizations to lobby for improved rule of law and property
rights protections, which increase state legitimacy and improve the investment
climate. The strength of the social contract and the power of the state to enforce
the rule of law affect incentives for cooperative or conflictive behavior among indi-
viduals and groups (Jeong, 2003; Rubenstein, 2003b). Additionally, equitable and
equally enforced rules and laws promote horizontal cooperation and trust by facili-
tating calculation-based trust. As a negative example, political corruption decreases
trust in all levels of society (Mitton, 2009). Also, political structures that encourage
nepotism or favoritism create disincentives to cooperation, which in turn decreases
economic opportunity, which creates more competition, and so forth.
From the security perspective, trust and cooperation cannot be achieved without
propitious conditions. As noted in Chapter Two, the high levels of risk or insecu-
rity inherent in post-conflict situations impede trust and cooperation. Risky situa-
tions encourage reversion to the relative security of one’s own group, increasing that
group’s cohesiveness but also its potential to threaten other groups (Brewer, 1999).
26 See Chapter Three of this volume regarding the sequencing of political and social
developments with elections.
27 Several international agreements govern the treatment of people tried for crimes
during periods of war: the Geneva Conventions and the two Additional Protocols,
the International Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, to name the most relevant.
28 The history of Turkey’s emergence as a state was, however, severely marred by the
tragedy that befell the Armenians. Some regard it to have been Turkish genocide;
others interpret history differently, but President Obama noted the tragedy of when
Establishing Social Conditions of Trust and Cooperation 229
“1.5 million Armenians were massacred or marched to their death in the final days
of the Ottoman Empire” (Baker, 2010).

CHAPTER SIx
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions
Claude Berrebi and Sarah Olmstead
Introduction
This chapter discusses the economics of stabilization and reconstruc-
tion (S&R). First we suggest a generic system view of what is needed.
We then discuss the differences between post-conflict and other devel-
opment settings. These differences have major implications for eco-
nomic objectives, goals, strategy, and metrics; what to an economist
would normally be “optimal” in traditional development settings often
becomes counterproductive when dealing with post-conflict settings.
We then summarize what appear from the literature to be best prac-
tices for economic efforts. It is not accidental that much of the empha-
sis in this chapter is actually about establishing political conditions con-
ducive to good economics. Ultimately, in the context of post-conflict
desirable economic conditions, the primary economic challenges are
political challenges.
To begin, then, Figure 6.1 is a general depiction (in the form of
a factor tree)1 of the pillars on which a healthy economy depends, as
viewed by an economist. As indicated at the bottom, economic health
also depends on adequate security, governance, and social consider-
ations, which affect all of the factors in the tree itself. This factor tree
could apply to either post-conflict or normal development settings, but
with differences relating to the relative intensity of effort on different
factors, the sequencing of those efforts, the type of aid employed, and
the type of market system used. That is, the intent of Figure 6.1 is to
be comprehensive, not to indicate priorities. For a given country, in
a given situation, some of the branches will be much more problem-
240 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
atic than others. Although we touch on all of the issues depicted in
Figure 6.1 in what follows, we have organized the discussion around
the particular issues and apparent dilemmas that arise in post-conflict
situations.

Post-Conflict Economics Versus “Business as Usual”
Generic Development Issues. Before addressing S&R, we should
note that the literature reveals a heated, more general disagreement as to
what developed countries can and should do for the poor of the world.
Motives and practices are still being debated, but developed countries
are certainly attempting, in various degrees, to help bring the poorest
citizens of the world up to some minimum level of economic develop-

ment. Members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s (OECD’s) Development Assistance Committee gave
almost US$90 billion in economic development aid in 2008 (OECD,
2010)—a substantial sum, considering that the debate still rages as to
whether aid actually helps countries, is simply wasted, or even makes
countries worse (de Ree and Nillesen, 2009; Collier and Hoeffler,
2002, 2004; Fearon, Humphreys, and Weinstein, 2009; and Chapter
Seven of this volume).
Economists Paul Collier and Jeffrey Sachs often argue that aid
money, spent wisely, can help bring development to the poor of the
world. Others, like William Easterly and Dambisa Moyo, suggest that
the aid system is broken and that donor countries may actually be pre-
venting growth in the countries they are trying to help. The debate is
heated, with well-respected scholars landing on all sides of the matter.
To date, there has been little empirical work that both sides can agree
on, so the argument is somewhat deadlocked in the academic literature.
Part of the problem is that measuring the effects of aid is difficult.
Further, organizations like the State Department and the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) have not traditionally set
aside sufficient time and money for rigorous quantitative assessments.
Recently, a parallel aid-giving organization, the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC), was formed by the U.S. government to try to
implement aid programs in a way that is more accountable and based
on empirical evidence and analysis. However, the MCC gives aid only
to countries that reach a certain level of governance. Thus, it is not
necessarily relevant for post-conflict settings characterized by relatively
poor governance and weak institutions (see Chapter Seven).
Issues in Post-Conflict Settings. Many issues faced by develop-
ing countries are the same in normal and post-conflict circumstances,
but exacerbated in the latter. There are also important differences. By
most accounts, countries in post-conflict transition have roughly a 50
percent chance of reverting to war or chaos (Del Castillo, 2008; Col-
lier, Hoeffler, and Söderbom, 2008). A basic goal of S&R, then, is to
avoid relapse into conflict (see Chapters Two and Four of this volume).
Beyond that, post-conflict states are “defined by inadequate human
resources, weak institutions, lack of technology and industrialization,
242 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
and low administrative and managerial capacity to use aid effectively”
(Del Castillo, 2008). Ideally, S&R projects pave the way for economic
development, but in these circumstances the challenge is enormous.
Table 6.1 lists some of the more dramatic differences between
development in normal and post-conflict situations. Economists seeking
to advise in post conflict circumstances must adjust their thinking substan
tially: The usual paradigms of “good economics” don’t necessarily apply.
These differences are at the heart of bitter disagreements between some
development economists and the World Bank and International Mone-
tary Fund (IMF). The IMF’s central policies include the desire to estab-
lish sustainable fiscal and monetary conditions and external balances,
which often leads to the adoption of austerity measures. That clearly
makes sense for the long term but can be the wrong prescription if the

Focus is on medium- and long-term
goals.
Focus must often be on short-term
(potentially distortionary) emergency
programs.
Choices are largely merit-based,
without regard to group affiliations.
Choices must often include preferential
efforts to assist groups affected by
conflict and by social inclusion policies.
Foreign assistance is low and stable. Foreign assistance spikes immediately
after conflict, varying thereafter.
Government institutions establish and
carry out rule of law.
Foreign troops support or possibly replace
weak or nonexistent government
institutions (e.g. police, army, judiciary)
to promote rule of law.
International community need not
involve itself in the country’s politics.
International involvement in country
politics is often intrusive and intense.

Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 243
economy has completely collapsed, as in a post-conflict situation.* In
the long term, such austerity measures as not printing money, cuts in
public spending, high interest rates, and credit constraints are neces-
sary to keep down inflation and decrease debt, but in the short term,
intervenors in post-conflict settings must do somewhat the opposite so
that people can start getting paid and money can start flowing through
the system (Elbadawi and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2007; Adam, Collier,
and Davies, 2008). Theory and data agree in this case. Empirically,
the evidence from economists Barro and Lee (2005) implies that “a
higher IMF loan-participation rate actually reduces economic growth”
and “has small negative effects on democracy and rule of law.” Even
the World Bank and IMF have, in recent times (see previous foot-
note), shifted their stringent austerity policies in some post-conflict
situations. In spite of continued disagreement over best practices in
economic S&R, the field is working toward some consensus, at least,
about the factors that intervenors should plan around.
Subsequent subsections deal with these special problems identi-
fied in Table 6.1; they address, respectively, economic aspects of prob-
lems related to insecurity; rule of law; corruption, poor governance,
and weak institutions; foreign aid and foreign donations; macroeco-
nomic problems; sovereignty issues; and fearing recurrence of conflict.
Insecurity
Insecurity strongly affects economic aspects of S&R. Most obviously,
generalized insecurity (e.g., murders, kidnappings, rapes, the presence
of landmines and unexploded ordinance) make it difficult to develop
the economy beyond sustenance levels. Other security-related post-
conflict problems include a lack of economic opportunity. Businesses
that were closed during the war may not yet be hiring (and may be
* Interestingly, in Iraq, the IMF required the end of fuel-price subsidies and recommended
an appreciation of the currency to tamp down inflation. Both policies had nearly immediate
positive impacts and did not constitute radical austerity. The IMF also made the substantive
case for immediate debt relief, which was cost-free for the Iraqis (costs were born by credi-
tors). The IMF did not require the Iraqis to curtail the Public Distribution System, which
provided a basic food basket to all Iraqis, with means testing.
244 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
damaged), while new-job creation is limited because investors and
entrepreneurs are deterred.
It follows that the intervening powers, international financial
institutions, and nongovernmental organizations seeking to get people
back to work first need to restore the confidence of citizens, investors,
and would-be builders.
Weak Rule of Law, or Bad Law
Economic development depends heavily on the so-called rule of law.
To be sure, this phrase is often used so loosely as to be meaningless and
is sometimes used in ways that beg the question of whose law rules. In
the case of economic S&R, rule of law is used primarily as it reflects on
the ability to do business. This involves not just physical security and
freedom from crime but also the functioning of laws and regulations
that allow for transparent and safe investment in an economy (Rose-
Ackerman, 2008). Some crucial elements are
1. a clear and well-publicized legal code to which everyone is to
adhere 2
2. property rights (ideally both physical and intellectual prop-
erty rights) and licensing, which must also prevent government
appropriation
3. binding and enforceable legal agreements, which also requires a
functioning and independent judiciary and clear rules on taxa-
tion of commercial activities and earned income (Cordesman,
2010).
Other elements include the assurance that laws will be enforced by
the administrative and judicial systems, and sufficient checks and bal-
ances so that the systems will operate fairly.
Post-conflict conditions are often not ripe for investment—either
because the institutions are too weak to engender trust or because
potential investors fear recurrence of conflict and loss of their money
(Hamre and Sullivan, 2002; Rose-Ackerman, 2008). A characteristic
of post-conflict countries is the limited usage of banks, either because
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 245
of a lack of understanding of what banks do, distrust of the banking
system, or lack of banking infrastructure.
Corruption, Poor Governance, and Weak Institutions
Although institutions are fundamental to economic change and main-
tenance of economic equilibrium, there is little satisfying theory on the
relationship between institutions and their economic effects (Chang
and Evans, 2000; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2005; Rodrik,
Subramanian, and Trebbi, 2004; Sachs, 2003). That said, it is easily
observable that administrative weaknesses can lead to a dysfunctional
government and dependence on foreign aid. Governments must raise
money by taxing the citizenry. If they are unable to do so because of
unchecked activities in the informal sectors or because they lack the
infrastructure to enforce taxation, then they will be unable to be self-
sufficient. This will lead either to state failure or ongoing dependence
on foreign aid.
Depending on the quality of pre-conflict institutions and human
capital, corruption may be high, expertise may be low, or both (Ace-
moglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2003; Rose-Ackerman, 2008; Aron,
2003). Post-conflict countries may be missing a large part of their pop-
ulation, either due to economic migration or conflict. If large num-
bers of educated workers were killed or driven away—either prior to,
during, or after conflict—the country may not have enough sufficiently
educated people left to administer programs. This lack of human capi-
tal may make the society more dependent on foreign aid and techni-
cal assistance. However, if institutional structures of an underdevel-
oped country are not functioning, they may be unable to use donations
effectively, cutting the potential benefits of the aid.
Institutions’ ability to use aid effectively may also reflect their
ability to use tax revenue effectively. There can be considerable resis-
tance to paying taxes if it appears that the money is not being spent
properly or that corrupt government officials are simply embezzling
the money.3 The poor capacity of the administrative infrastructure to
extract revenue from the populace thus can lead to a cycle of aid.
Finally, weak institutions can foster corruption in the system,
potentially exacerbating inequality, as the rich are generally better able
246 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
to pay bribes and find their way in a corrupt system (Mauro, 2004;
Rose-Ackerman, 2008). Even if the institutions are not in fact corrupt
or especially corrupt, if they are not trusted by the citizenry, then they
will be incapable of carrying out their missions. Anticorruption efforts
must begin immediately in conjunction with other stability efforts, for
there is evidence that the longer people live with corruption, the longer
it takes to purge from the system (Mauro, 2004). Spending time and
resources to get institutions right to begin with can save a lot of prob-
lems in the long run.
Foreign Aid and Foreign Donors
Aid takes diverse forms such as humanitarian aid, trade agreements,
technical assistance, aid tied to specific projects or outcomes, and for-
eign financing, e.g., for credit institutions. Humanitarian assistance is
necessary and important but mainly is for immediate consumption.
For the most part, it does not contribute to sustainable investment and
development, but it does buy time for other economic S&R projects to
kick in. Unlike humanitarian assistance, foreign financing and techni-
cal assistance build capacity and are essential elements in post-conflict
S&R programs. One of the biggest problems is the destruction of the
human and physical infrastructure that occurred in conflict. Techni-
cal assistance and foreign financing can help redevelop or develop new
local capacity allowing for sustainable development. Lastly, tied aid
is also common. In a normal development setting, tied aid may be
useful, but in a post-conflict context it often slows down and compli-
cates reconstruction; also, it often leads to programs that the country
does not need (Del Castillo, 2008).
A foreign donor can be involved in post-conflict S&R as a facili-
tator and coordinator or as the primary actor. In normal development
scenarios, donors prefer not to implement aid programs themselves but
rather to task foreign or local implementing partners (Ohiorhenuan
and Stewart, 2008). So, for instance, if a foreign donor wants to sup-
port a program to foster better cooperation among farmers by devel-
oping water-user associations in Yemen, it would prefer to have local
elements from the Yemeni civil society and perhaps Yemen’s Minis-
try of Agriculture enact the actual program. The donor would then
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 247
help along the way, but mainly it would just check that progress is
being made in meeting the agreed-on goals. This method helps in get-
ting program goals adopted because local workers perceive ownership,
rather than having patronizing foreigners tell them what they are doing
“wrong” and how they should be doing things “right.” This approach
may also mitigate the problem (Ghani and Lockhart, 2008) of having
foreign assistance organizations outbidding the government in hiring
scarce skilled staff, thereby weakening the state.
However, in cases where there is little local expertise on the
ground, as is often the case in countries decimated by conflict or expe-
riencing severe population flight, foreign-aid donors often play a more
active role (see, for example, the case of East Timor in Dobbins et al.,
2005). This may achieve satisfactory results in the short term, but in
the long term, transition of implementation to the local administra-
tion is needed. Chapter Seven of this volume describes further details
about the conditionality and effectiveness of aid, as well as the assorted
uncertainties and dilemmas associated with its application (see also
Roodman, 2007, for a survey of the aid-effectiveness literature).
Macroeconomic Problems
Deep macroeconomic challenges—often including high budget defi-
cits, inflation, and debt burden—can strain even a well-functioning
government. Stability and reconstruction projects must work even
harder yet, however, if they must also deal with distorted economies,
lack of transparency, poor governance, and corruption (Acemoglu,
Johnson, and Robinson, 2003; Adam, Collier, and Davies, 2008).
Nonetheless, these large-scale macroeconomic problems are initially
second-order problems in that they mainly affect long-term economic
growth and development, whereas rebuilding infrastructure, immedi-
ate job creation, confronting social inequities, etc., are short-to-inter-
mediate-term necessities. Dealing with these challenges, then, requires
thoughtful balancing of the short- and long-term needs.
Another immediate economic problem is the possible presence
of a strong informal economy. Informal economies can be useful in
employing people and allowing them to exchange goods and services.
However, a thriving informal sector, or large black or gray markets, may
248 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
also discourage participation in more-expensive licit transactions and
investments and consequently limit economic development (Gerxhani,
2004). Additionally, since the informal economy is difficult to measure
or control, it prevents the government from taxing or regulating these
markets (Ohiorhenuan and Stewart, 2008).
Sovereignty Issues
Sovereignty is an issue in both underdeveloped countries and failed
states, and it may challenge post-conflict S&R. Post-conflict govern-
ments may not have control over the full territory of the state, meaning
both that they may not be able to provide goods and services and that
they might not be able to police all areas of the country. Limited sov-
ereignty can lead to strong criminal or terrorist networks and thriving
black markets.
Sometimes, lack of sovereign control over territory is paired with
a lack of control of important natural resources, which spells trouble
for post-conflict governance (Collier, Hoeffler, and Söderbom, 2008).
On the one hand, a government cannot afford to overextend its secu-
rity services because of the risk of being unable to protect populated
areas in the event of renewed insurgency. On the other hand, if the
rebel insurgency during the conflict was fueled by extractive natural
resources, it is important to cut off the funding for future insurgency
groups by exerting firm control over those resources. Additionally, if
governments have no control over the natural resources, they lose what
would otherwise be related tax revenues from those resources, which
also affects the extent to which they are able to fund and provide ser-
vices to the nation (Easterlin, 1976; Ascher, 1999).
Control over natural resources in and of itself can be especially
problematic if there is high corruption, opaque governance, or misman-
agement. It is crucial that the government maintain control over access
to these resources in a transparent fashion, regulate their exploitation,
and use revenues derived from taxation or sales of the resources in a
transparent way to further social welfare. Perceptions can be crucial,
because if citizens observe that governments extract high-value com-
modities without providing any benefits in terms of service provision
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 249
or other welfare-enhancing transfers, this can easily lead to discontent
and possibly a recurrence of violence (Ascher, 1999; Sambanis, 2004).
Such state influence in managing resources is not so much to be
thought of as a “socialistic” system, but one in which the government
must maintain a common property regime, where “group size and
behavioral rules are specified,” but not an open access regime (a “free-
for all”) (Bromley and Cernea, 1989). As the World Bank asserts, “The
establishment and strengthening of institutional arrangements can be
essential for ensuring sustainable development and thus protecting the
effectiveness of development investments and their stream of benefits”
(Bromley and Cernea, 1989). In ensuring that resource markets are not
a free-for-all, however, central and local governments must have a long-
term plan for how to decrease the level of their activity in the resource
market. There should be provisions set out at the beginning that dictate
a schedule for opening markets and lay out some transition period from
government control to a more ideal economic system for the particular
cultural setting. A spectrum of possibilities exists between complete
privatization and complete centralization.
Recurrence of Conflict
An overarching consideration is taking special note of the circum-
stances under which conflict first arose. Statistically, this is one of the
most important factors in fostering economic recovery and prevent-
ing backsliding; it may also dictate the strategies that can be used to
address the other challenges mentioned above. These will often be in
conflict with narrowly construed economic efficiency but are necessary
for the long-run success of economic reconstruction.
For instance, if the combatants in a conflict were divided by racial
or religious lines, projects may need corrective inclusive policies (Fearon,
Humphreys, and Weinstein, 2009). Policies that seen to benefit one
group over another could lead back to conflict (Stewart, 2000; Brown,
Stewart, and Langer, 2007). Projects therefore may need to ensure that
beneficiaries, and local institutions implementing the programs, come
from all the different combatant groups—or, alternatively, that enough
separate programs exist for all groups to benefit from.
250 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
As a past example, we might consider Rwanda, which had a
bloody 100-day ethnic conflict in 1994 between Hutus and Tutsi
ethnic groups, leaving up to 1 million dead (mostly Tutsis and moder-
ate Hutus). A Tutsi leader (Paul Kagame) regained control, ended the
killing, and formed a government that sought to end the ethnic strife.
In the name of reconciliation, a Hutu (Pasteur Bizimungu) was named
President. Numerous issues arose that involved both economics and
larger considerations. For example, if post-conflict banks only hired
Tutsi loan officers, Hutus would have felt that the odds were stacked
against them in getting a loan; that might have deterred them from
applying, thereby stifling their full participation in economic recon-
struction. Instead, a mix of loan officers was required. More generally,
and despite expectations by some that the Tutsi-led government would
adopt revenge-seeking policies, the government instead worked toward
reconciliation—between Hutus and Tutsis, and also for other margin-
alized groups, such as women.
Pursuing the bank-loan example, economists might have balked
at ensuring that Hutus and Tutsis gain equally (or perhaps proportion-
ally) from bank loans, because such a division would not have been
seen as maximizing marginal productivity. Bankers would have wanted
to give loans to the technically best-qualified individuals, regardless of
ethnicity. In post-conflict settings, however, such “optimal” economic
policies could potentially lead to the recurrence of conflict, which is
obviously not an optimal outcome, even if the policies that led there
were “right” by standard economic thinking.
The post-conflict population might also need other types of dis-
tortionary aid, such as food aid or cash transfers. These types of aid,
for which locals do not have to work or provide accountability, can
create strong disincentives in the labor market; they would not be con-
sidered as viable options for economic development in nonemergency
situations.
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 251
A Customized Approach
We have identified similarities and differences between normal and
post-conflict development settings, but we need also to mention that
each post-conflict setting comes with its own unique history, which
affects greatly what is feasible and desirable.
Initial Conditions
Initial conditions, i.e., the reasons for the conflict and the method by
which the conflict ended, can affect feasible reconstruction strategies.
If the country had relatively high human capital prior to the conflict,
it can be relatively easier to return to that point (Del Castillo, 2008).
Some of the people will still remember a time when government was
functional and what normalcy should mean. In that case, the focus
might be physically rebuilding institutions that were destroyed, while
simultaneously bringing human capital back from refugee camps or
from abroad or renewing the educational processes that built that
human capital in the first place. Table 6.2 lists some of the important
characteristics.
Some post-conflict countries come from a level of relatively high
development but also of high inequality. This is often the case in coun-
tries that are rich in natural resources—they may have high gross
domestic product per capita, but the wealth and power is concentrated
in the hands of a small elite. In such a case, S&R projects might want
to focus on developing mechanisms for accountability, transparency,
and profit sharing in the exploitation of the region’s natural resources
to avoid what might have been a contributor to the source of conflict
in the first place. In the following paragraphs, we discuss how conflict
began and ended, since those are two of the most important initial
conditions, and then we discuss how initial conditions make a differ-
ence by comparing actual examples from post-conflict reconstruction
projects.
How Conflict Began
The flashpoints and drivers of conflicts vary greatly depending on the
setting and on who is involved in the conflict. Did one country invade
252 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
another? Did a region attempt to secede? Did one element of society
turn against the other? Was there a coup? Was there some other trigger,
such as the death of a leader or other sudden event? All of these factors
will affect how post-conflict reconstruction should take shape.
How a conflict began will have ramifications for which economic
factors to emphasize. For instance, if a country’s leader died and that
instigated a violent scramble for power between two parties, it may

Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 253
be important to work with both parties on the economic and recon-
struction plans and involve each of them in the post-conflict political
process, lest the loser take on an obstructionist stance. However, as dis-
cussed in other chapters of this volume, the problems of power-sharing
are severe, and some scholars argue that post-conflict prospects are best
if there is a decisive victor.
How Conflict Ended
Conflicts can end in any number of ways: with one side or the other
surrendering, through negotiated peace, through militarized inter-
national intervention, or through one side retreating to regroup and
recover its strength in order to fight anew at some later date. The
manner of a conflict’s ending greatly affects both the possibilities of
reconstruction and the methods that should be used. For instance, in
the case of East Timor, the peacekeeping forces made specific efforts to
include the pro-Indonesian groups in the pre-independence referenda
and public education campaigns and in the post-independence transi-
tion activities. If there is an armed group contesting the legitimacy of
the post-conflict government, this could seriously damage the progress
of S&R programs and prevent citizens and businesses from wanting
to invest in what might well be a short-lived peace. Thus, making sure
that potential spoilers are included in the process at all stages, even if it
would be easier or faster to exclude them, may be crucial to successfully
transitioning to peace. As mentioned above, difficulties of this sort are
absent if there was a more decisive victory.
There is suggestive evidence that if peacekeeping and aid dona-
tions start flowing too early in a conflict, the conflict might actually
continue longer than it otherwise might have (Elbadawi and Sambanis,
2000). This kind of counterproductive outcome could be a matter of
combatants believing that a foreign nation-builder is taking a partisan
position, which may give their cause a convenient rallying point. Alter-
natively, it could be that the government overestimates its abilities to
confront rebellions and engage in what would otherwise be deemed
premature actions (such as offensive actions against a stronger or better
armed foe) because they now enjoy the support of peacekeeping forces
on their side (Elbadawi and Sambanis, 2000).
254 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
There are also important reasons not to let conflict continue and
reach a state in which chances of a recovery process succeeding are
significantly reduced. Civil war and other conflicts have far-reaching
regional, and even global, effects. The longer a conflict continues, the
more economic and social misery it spreads to neighboring states and
elsewhere and the harder it is for the entire region to recover (Collier,
2003; Sambanis, 2004).
How a conflict ended will also likely decide what kind of gov-
ernment the postwar society will have. If the conflict ended by peace
treaty, there may be a transitional authority that will run the country
for a short time until a permanent government is elected. This could
also be the point at which a country decides how much power it wants
to give the central government versus regional governing authorities.
These decisions will have ramifications for how intervenors should plan
to work with local and national government.
Somalia and the Solomon Islands: A Comparison
To illustrate these distinctions, let us look at the examples of post-
conflict reconstruction in Somalia and the Solomon Islands. The inter-
vention efforts in both countries had similar approaches but vastly
different outcomes. Somalia and the Solomon Islands saw $137 and
$181, respectively, in average annual assistance per capita over the first
two years of intervention operations (Dobbins et al., 2008a, p. 221).
Somalia and the Solomon Islands had, respectively, 6.7 and 3.96 for-
eign troops and 0.01 and 0.66 police per 1,000 people at the interven-
tion’s peak (Dobbins et al., 2008a, pp. 211–212). Despite similar S&R
strategies, the Solomon Islands recovered well, while Somalia is still
in shambles two decades later. Part of the reason is that the countries
started out from very different sets of initial conditions, but also, the
Australians intervening in the Solomon Islands were able to learn from
mistakes made in Somalia and elsewhere and managed to adjust their
policies to achieve greater results with the same basic resources.
Somalia fell into conflict in 1991 following the overthrow of
Major General Muhammad Siad Barre, and the entire country quickly
fragmented into warring factions. The UN intervened in 1992 to pro-
vide humanitarian assistance and monitor a ceasefire in the capital,
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 255
Mogadishu. This initial intervention was fought by General Mohamed
Farah Aideed, one of those fighting for control over Mogadishu. His
forces attacked UN forces and forced the UN Security Council to send
in U.S.-led troops to safeguard the humanitarian mission (Dobbins
et al., 2003). This is in contrast to the case of the Solomon Islands,
where the transitional Prime Minister (appointed as part of a peace
treaty) officially requested that the Australians come in and help pro-
vide security to mediate in the conflict that had been going on for
several years between the residents of the country’s two largest islands,
Guadalcanal and Malaita (Dobbins et al., 2008a). The difference in
situations here points to the importance of understanding how a war
has ended—whether there has been a mutually adopted peace treaty or
whether some factions are ready to continue the violence.
Both countries had limited and weak institutional structures
before conflict. The Solomon Islands had serious corruption problems
prior to their conflict, while in Somalia it was less an issue of corrup-
tion as an absence of any functioning systems of government. The fact
that the government in the Solomon Islands had not completely col-
lapsed was one of the key reasons Australia agreed to get involved in
the situation (Dobbins et al., 2008a). In the end, the failure in Somalia
was in large part due to a failure to get the security situation under
control and a peacekeeping force that was too small to take on security
while simultaneously dealing with trying to build a new government.
This comparison demonstrates that similar S&R efforts in different
settings can and will likely yield differing outcomes.
What Can We Learn from History?
Intervenors can glean much from studying the combinations of what
has and has not worked historically. Expectations must be tempered,
however. Unfortunately, there is little quantitative analytical research
(as distinct from higher-level observational research) regarding such
reconstruction efforts in the post–Cold War period. Numerous papers
look at post–World War II economic reconstruction, but that is not
very relevant to today’s situations. The world wars involved industrial-
ized economies with well-educated labor forces and highly developed
socioeconomic and political institutions that could be adapted to eco-
256 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
nomic reconstruction. This century has most commonly seen conflicts
in more pre-industrial settings. Also, analysts of post–world war recon-
struction focused on the impact of economic reparations, which are
not a major issue in recent post-conflict situations. Yet another short-
coming of the empirical literature as a basis for current thinking is that
many of the past studies have looked at transitions from communism
or socialism to democratic regimes. In recent conflicts, the issue is less
one of previously closed markets as perhaps a lack of access to inter-
national markets due to poor infrastructure in existing institutions or
combative international relationships.
Goals and Measurements for Economic Reconstruction
Given the many variables and challenges faced in a post-conflict recon-
struction setting, it is not a simple matter to identify what goals nation-
builders should realistically try to set. Most broadly, the aims should be
to rehabilitate basic services and infrastructure and to lay a framework
for recovery growth. This includes creating a macroeconomic agenda
for the “reactivation of licit investment and sustainable and equitable
growth” (Del Castillo, 2008). The second main goal, as previously
stated, is to consolidate and maintain peace.
How can these broad goals be measured? * It is helpful to break the
goals down into smaller, more-concrete goals with associated metrics.
Many of these relate to creating an administrative system that is strong,
transparent, and able to manage the program of economic reforms
(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2003; Rodrik, Subramanian, and
Trebbi, 2004; Sachs, 2003). The metrics should be useful, relevant, and
timely to decisionmakers and credible to the public (Barton, 2008).
Measures should be realistically gatherable, which is a challenge.
For instance, getting accurate estimates of an informal economy can
* For some purposes, it can be argued that the key metrics for monitoring progress are rela-
tively simple: (1) Are jobs increasing or decreasing? (2) Are prices stable or inflating? (3) Is the
banking system working or failing? (4) Is corruption moderate or outrageous? (5) Are jobs
and economic gains concentrated or widely dispersed? In what follows, we found it necessary
to go into more depth.
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 257
be very difficult. Thus, it is often necessary to find reasonable prox-
ies for values of interest, proxies that can be measured fairly often so
that they can be used to inform potential mid-course corrections of
policy (Barton, 2008). Proxies are imperfect, however, and can also be
“gamed.” Changes may then be necessary, which may sacrifice the flow
of consistently defined data.
Ultimately, intervenors wish to know whether their efforts had
a positive impact. For that, they need to collect a lot of information,
particularly reliable before-and-after data, and preferably data from
similar places, only some of which benefited from S&R programs (to
permit a so-called quasi-experimental design). Unfortunately, it is not
always possible to collect such extensive data (see also Chapter Seven
of this volume).
Given that evaluation of progress is so important, intervenors
should plan an evaluation strategy from the beginning of the project.
To do this, researchers must decide on which metrics best capture the
qualities they are trying to promote adequately and are also testable
and measurable. For instance, if an international financial organiza-
tion wants to support the improvement of the rule of law, it should not
just count how many judges have been trained on rule-of-law issues.
Instead, measures of output and outcomes should be sought, such as
the number of relevant court decisions and the quality of these deci-
sions. The U.S. State Department has developed a list of indicators
for evaluating their foreign assistance programs (Department of State,
2008). Selected metrics are displayed in Table 6.3. These relate to the
S&R themes discussed later in this chapter.
Providing Conditions for Economic Improvements
Economic growth depends on the strength of a country’s macroeco-
nomic foundations and administrative institutions. Intervenors will
want to emphasize the creation of corresponding bodies dealing with,
notably, sound fiscal and monetary policy, management of external
debt, identification of needed structural reforms, trade policy, the For-
eign Exchange regime, rule-based governance (including property and
intellectual property rights), the development of markets, and environ-
mental policies and regulations.

Two types of measurement metrics are possible in this case—
measurements of the institutions built and measurements of the out-
comes of their policies:
1. Measurements of Institutions. The first set of measurements
addresses whether the appropriate institutions are in place and
functioning; for example, are they transparent, do they have
actual decisionmaking authority or are they beholden to politi-
cal powers, and are checks and balances in place?
2. Measurement of Outcomes. The second set of questions relates to
actual economic changes, such as the rate of growth of GDP,
poverty and inequality, distributional considerations (across
regions, factions, ethnic groups, etc.), estimated activity in licit
and illicit markets, food and commodity prices, exchange rates,
foreign investment, investment in human capital (education,
health), and other common measures of economic health.

ment Indicators, Transparency International, and other NGOs) and

theoretical assessment of the legal architecture (Are there assurances
in the constitution that give institutions power? Are there clear checks
and balances?) (Kaufmann and Kraay, 2002; Rodrik, Subramanian,
and Trebbi, 2004). The reality of whether institutions are functioning
properly is more difficult. One can measure whether people are being
tried and convicted on corruption charges, or the length of time it
takes to apply for a business license, but these measurements may be
more time-consuming and costly than gathering opinions or noting
the existence of policies (whether or not they are actually enforced)
(North, 1990).
The second set of indicators may require special effort by the
intervenor to get thorough and reliable data. For instance, while prices,
exchange rates, and other measures may be readily observable, other
measures are not so (black/gray market activity, measures of equality,
etc.). Furthermore, some of the measures that are typically used, like
GDP growth rate or poverty, are troublesome. Observing simple GDP
growth rates, for instance, may obscure distributional issues or tempo-
rary distortions due to the influx of foreign funds (Citro and Michael,
1996; Deaton, 2005; Firebaugh, 2006). Also, several measures of pov-
erty exist, with different usefulness. For example, the percentage of the
population earning less than $2 a day in purchasing power parity (PPP)
may be less explanatory than measures of consumption, which may
better measure participation in informal markets (Citro and Michael,
1996; Elbadawi, 1999; Deaton, 2005; Firebaugh, 2006).
The following subsections discuss generating employment, tack-
ling horizontal inequities, and public-sector management in more
detail.
Generating Employment
Restoring economic health will help with employment generation, but
special steps may need to be taken to achieve sufficient job creation
and other economic opportunities, especially for youth and especially
in the short term. Employment opportunities can also give displaced
people a reason to return to their homes and give people who were
considering criminality a viable alternative. Depending on the level of
infrastructural damage, it may take a while for businesses to return to
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 261
full capacity. Some temporary work may be generated directly by the
renovation efforts—roads and buildings will need to be rebuilt in the
short run—but if these short-term hires do not see better, longer-term
job prospects coming down the road, resentment and unhappiness may
build. It is therefore especially important to focus on high-risk groups,
such as young men, ex-militants, and disaffected or traditionally mar-
ginalized social groups, such as ethnic minorities or women.
Incomes have been shown to correlate negatively with conflict,
which has been interpreted to mean that those with higher incomes
have higher opportunity costs if they stay out of the licit economic
system and rather engage in rebel movements (Collier and Hoeffler,
2002). This theory represents the traditional economic approach,
though in the face of some empirical data that show that high incomes
are sometimes positively correlated with militant activity, the idea is
still being debated (Easterlin, 1995, 2001; Berrebi, 2007). However,
even if incomes are not directly correlated with conflict, it is still nec-
essary to generate good employment outcomes to achieve economic
stability and well-being.
One of the serious threats to security, especially after a conflict,
is disparity between expectations and reality. If the conflict or post-
conflict period started off with promises of a bright new future and
that is not what transpires, frustration could easily build. This kind of
disparity often contributes to the outbreak of war to begin with (East-
erlin, 1976)—when people are overeducated relative to existing market
opportunities or have been told that there would be great economic
opportunities waiting for them after school, and they find a different
reality. This is especially troublesome with youth (Cincotta, Engelman,
and Anastasion, 2003).
There is some dispute, however, over how much unemployment
levels influence conflict. Berman, Felter, and Shapiro (2009) assert the
surprising result that “high unemployment is associated with a difficult
operating environment for insurgents, either because unemployment
is an inadvertent side-effect of effective security pressure (greater state
security precautions might restrict travel and thus increase unemploy-
ment), or because the price of information about insurgent activity is
lower in a depressed economy” (it could be that, when unemployment
262 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
rises, the price of leaking information to the authorities declines). They
find evidence that when unemployment is high, insurgents switch to
tactics that are less directly targeted at international forces.
Whether or not unemployment is directly related to higher levels
of conflict, it is certainly a crucial indicator of the health of an econ-
omy. Where possible, immediate, low-skill work should be created that
would, at minimum, contribute to other reconstruction projects, such
as rebuilding infrastructure. Those involved in S&R should make sure,
however, to minimize the distortion of the job market. In East Timor,
the UN peacekeeping mission was responsible for 12–20 percent of all
formal employment, and wages were out of keeping with local stan-
dards (that is, those working for the UN were paid significantly higher
rates than those employed in the locally supported economy) (U.S.
Joint Forces Command, 2009). Such an overactive role may be avoided
if intervenors work through local partners. Prior to launching S&R
operations, it is necessary to assess the country’s levels of human capital
and the state of its physical infrastructure, level of functioning domes-
tic enterprise, the population’s entrepreneurial abilities, the availability
of raw materials, accessibility to markets, and other business-related
factors, all of which will determine the best approach strategy of how
to develop long-term employment growth.
Measuring job creation can be done effectively to the extent that
most jobs are in the formal sector, but if there is significant informal
labor force, more effort will be needed and estimates will remain only
approximate. Additionally, if there is a large diaspora population,
households could be relying heavily on remittances from family mem-
bers abroad, which could confound implication of the unemployment
figures.
Tackling Horizontal Inequalities (Distributional Issues)
Horizontal inequalities are systematic inequalities that tend to fall
along ethnic, religious, or geographic lines. Frances Stewart has argued
that because people of similar groups tend to clump geographically,
regional data can often be a proxy for other differences, such as ethnic-
ity and religion (Stewart, 2000; Brown, Stewart, and Langer, 2007).
In supporting recovery, external assistance should seek to reduce ten-
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 263
sion points, such as group-based inequality. To do this, those involved
with S&R operations, with the help of local knowledge, must assess
the extent and nature of inequalities and adopt appropriate policies to
address them. Inequalities can be addressed through indirect policies
(building infrastructure in underserved areas, for instance) or through
progressive taxation and expenditure that favor the poor (Ohiorhenuan
and Stewart, 2008).
Other socially inclusive policies might include special programs
for poverty monitoring and analysis or “pro-poor” programs. These
also might include rebuilding the social safety net. Collier and Hoef-
fler have found evidence that “the post-conflict society should pay
more attention to improvements in social policy and less attention to
improvements in macro policy” (2004, p. 11). One of the policies that
could foster social inclusion is using aid to subsidize domestic enter-
prise, particularly to hire and train particular target groups, and pro-
vide investment through micro- and small-size lending. This type of
policy can spur job growth and give natives a stake in the economic
outcomes of the country (Del Castillo, 2008). It also builds on local
knowledge of domestic needs and supports entrepreneurial creativity,
which can be a very valuable tool for engaging natives in the recon-
struction process.
Agricultural subsidies and special “reconstruction” or “free-trade”
zones that target the production of exports could be another way to
improve social inclusion. Agricultural subsidies can help lower food
prices, which are a significant indicator of quality of life, and the dual
strategy of agricultural and industrial support helps support people in
all parts of the economy (one should, however, evaluate carefully the
distortionary losses caused by subsidies against potential welfare gains
in each case separately). Economic growth and S&R does not guaran-
tee social inclusion, but policies that provide access to economic oppor-
tunities for all parts of society will help in tackling horizontal inequali-
ties and contribute to stability.
Public-Sector Management
If a post-conflict country has lost significant infrastructure and specific
local institutional “know-how,” this can have serious repercussions for
264 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
its ability to provide basic services to people. Public-sector manage-
ment issues include the efficiency and equity of public expenditures,
revenue collecting, the accountability of public services, and the man-
aging of natural resources and distributing related revenues in a trans-
parent and equitable way. Equitable sharing of resources, natural and
economic, is very important in a post-conflict zone, especially if there
was a class, race, religious, or other sectarian rivalry that contributed to
the violence (Brinkerhoff, 2005; Brown, Stewart, and Langer, 2007).
Measures and metrics associated with public-sector management again
should relate to transparency of institutions, particularly the ones
taxing residents and deciding how to spend that money (Rodrik, 2000,
2004; Rose-Ackerman, 2008).
Proper public-sector management is a longer-term end and is
extremely important for a sustainable pattern of growth. When the
foreign assistance fades away, post-conflict countries must be left with a
functional apparatus that allows the state to collect revenue and spend
it on its citizens (Rodrik, 2003). However, metrics used in measuring
the effectiveness and progress of new infrastructure should not be con-
tent with simply measuring the number or size of projects that allows
for delivering of public services (roads, utilities, etc.), but rather must
also include the context in which each project was built and other less
tangible characteristics, such as where it was built, which communities
it serves, etc.
Other Post-Conflict Development Issues
As discussed throughout this volume, economic reconstruction does
not occur in a vacuum; it is one element of S&R. The literature makes
it clear that several interconnected facets need to be taken into account
when undertaking S&R projects, including security, politics, prior
planning, timing, coordination, and foreign aid. All of these work
together and interact, and if one element is lacking in the overall S&R
plan, it can jeopardize the rest. We discuss this briefly in what follows.
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 265
Security First
As mentioned previously, security is one of the most important first
steps to building economic recovery. If people are afraid to go out
on the street and get to work, then all other recovery measures are
unlikely to succeed. Of course, the economic situation will also have
feedback effects on the level of security in a post-conflict country. Eco-
nomic reconstruction projects can contribute to resolving conflicts by
giving people some desirable end to act toward, an end that frequently
requires and enables cooperation across social groups (Stewart, 2002).
However, it is important that foreign peacekeepers understand what is
possible in terms of security. The process by which stable states form
is a slow one. Foreign donors should not be under the impression that
they can quickly or easily enforce security regardless of traditional cul-
ture and other societal variables (Krause and Jutersonke, 2005). In the
end, building trust and cooperation is what improves security, and the
trust-building process is naturally a long one.
How security relates to S&R programs is the subject of Chapter
Two of this volume.
Keep Politics in Mind
If the political agreement and economic program are not integrated,
the country risks plunging back into conflict. There are several factors
that influence this relationship. First is that the government receiving
the aid must feel engaged in the process of using that aid and develop-
ing the reconstruction plans. If domestic political partners are not on
board with the reconstruction agenda, then they are not likely to get
much support anywhere in the rest of the country. The situation may
become politically sensitive if it is perceived that there is a foreign body
moving autonomously within a country, enacting policies and building
infrastructure, etc. Without political support, S&R programs can be
undermined or dismissed by the local stakeholders from which support
is necessary (Barton, 2008). It is essential for foreign actors to assess the
political state of the post-conflict country and work with local lead-
ers to determine the types of reconstruction efforts that are politically
viable (Pouligny, 2000; Rose-Ackerman, 2008).
266 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
The political aspect of S&R programs is the subject of Chapter
Three of this volume.
Timing and Prior Planning
There is a tension between, on the one hand, planning S&R programs
out thoroughly before initiating a strategy that might not be appro-
priate, and, on the other hand, establishing a reconstruction presence
early on in the process. The literature debates the most appropriate
and effective point at which S&R projects should be implemented in a
conflict timeline. Should donors wait until the fighting has completely
stopped to begin economic recovery programs, or can these operations
work even before every last bit of insurgency is quelled? The evidence
is not clear on this matter, and often donor governments feel that they
cannot wait too long to intervene, if only due to humanitarian con-
cerns. However, Elbadawi and Sambanis (2000) have found macroeco-
nomic evidence that interventions too early in a conflict can actually
prolong it.
The timing and level of prior planning is also related to the mag-
nitude of the reconstruction efforts. Comprehensive reforms require
longer planning, but there is theoretical evidence that suggests that
gradual reforms are less likely to work than ambitious, comprehensive
reforms (Mauro, 2004). The idea is that when reforms are gradual,
individuals in the post-conflict society have more time to grow accus-
tomed to the “bad” way of doing things.
Some actions must be taken immediately before economic recon-
struction can occur. First, humanitarian crises must be addressed; addi-
tionally, policymakers must focus immediately on such problems as job
creation, infrastructure-rebuilding, and institution-building. These are
first-order issues that are essential for S&R and to avoid the loss of
whatever political and social stability may still be present after the con-
flict concludes. Also, some S&R projects must be undertaken quickly
to take advantage of the spike in donor aid that usually accompanies
the end of a war; there may be only a short window of opportunity for
these kinds of aid and structural changes to work (Demekas, McHugh,
and Kosma, 2002; Collier and Hoeffler, 2004; see also Figure 6.2).
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 267
While these short-term projects are being implemented, the for-
eign intervenors can take the opportunity to think and carefully plan
the mid- and long-term strategies. These plans must take into account
the specific conflict’s context, including the needs of the country as
well as their capacity to enact reforms and S&R strategies. It is crucial
in the planning phase to identify the critical factors that need to be
addressed in light of the particular circumstances (Ohiorhenuan and
Stewart, 2008).
In the longer term, those implementing S&R projects must also
help develop the strong microeconomic foundations that will continue
the growth into the future. This second-order work should include
the development of “legal and institutional frameworks, a function-
ing financial sector and an effective public sector to create an adequate
business climate, and promote policies to alleviate poverty and support
human development” (Del Castillo, 2008).

268 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Coordination
Coordination of activities with all relevant actors—all the institutions
of government, civil society, the UN, international financial institu-
tions, other foreign actors, etc.—is critical to the success of S&R efforts.
Institutions in many countries, from developed to post-conflict, suffer
from ill effects of compartmentalization, both between and within
institutions. Within aid-giving agencies, as well, compartmentalization
has been a perennial problem. Even though many agencies have made
statements and commitments to promoting “harmonization and align-
ment” of activities and priorities, little has come of it (Burke, 2008).
One approach the international community has taken to combat this
problem is to introduce the idea of a multidonor trust fund (MDTF),
in which all donors contribute money to a single fund that is then cen-
trally distributed to make sure that each agency is not working at odds
or reinventing the wheel (though critics also suggest that MDTFs may
charge excessive overhead and prioritize their own projects rather than
local initiatives) (Ohiorhenuan and Stewart, 2008, p. 91).
If communication and coordination is lacking, those involved
in S&R programs cannot know what kind of capacity exists to carry
out their agenda. Even worse, it could be that activities are not only
poorly coordinated or duplicated but actually contradict each other.
One practitioner gave an example in an interview: “You might have a
situation where the UN is trying to build capacity of a local govern-
ment by setting up a trust fund to pay civil servants’ salaries, and at the
same time the government is under fiscal austerity measures from the
IMF” (Herrhausen, 2007, p. 34). Such inconsistencies erode both the
credibility and the effectiveness of reconstruction activities. Further,
if there is poor coordination, implementers are forced to be reactive
rather than proactive—they are left cleaning up messes rather than
planning successful operations. There are three basic groups of actors
among which the intervenor must coordinate: state institutions, civil
society, and other aid donors.
First and foremost, there must be coordination between those
involved in S&R programs and all the state governmental institu-
tions. Intervenors should make sure not just that there is transparency
between themselves and the government, but that all the governmental
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 269
ministries are also transparent and cooperative with each other. Next,
there needs to be coordination between those involved in S&R pro-
grams and civil society. In an inclusive government, civil society should
serve a great role in implementing policies, training locals, and garner-
ing support for reconstruction initiatives (Herrhausen, 2007). Finally,
there needs to be coordination and cooperation among aid donors. Part
of the challenge here is that aid agencies themselves may be very com-
partmentalized, leaving very little room for them to coordinate with
other groups. Additionally, there may be some level of proprietary feel-
ing over activities that makes actors less willing to cooperate and coor-
dinate; good planning should make sure to put these aside and enforce
cooperation.
Foreign Aid
As discussed earlier, the utility of foreign aid has been debated exten-
sively, with no clear conclusions. That debate has occurred mostly in
the context of normal development situations, rather than specifically
about post-conflict settings. However, aid may contribute to the recur-
rence of violence, and, if post-conflict countries are not supported in
their initial transition phases, resources and investments can be lost
and conflict perpetuated. Post-conflict countries will likely also need
some kind of aid, both in the short and longer term, for S&R opera-
tions to be successful.
For more on foreign aid and its use in S&R programs, see Chapter
Seven of this volume.
Best Practices
General
The transition to peace from a post-conflict setting is a difficult path
with many pitfalls. Economic development is difficult enough; in an
insecure and potentially unstable setting, it is even more difficult. To
make the process of planning economic S&R programs more simple,
we have gathered below a set of best practices from the literature. When
considering these practices, planners still need to take into account the
270 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
individual circumstances of the target country, such as the origins and
ending of the conflict, amount of conflict damage, and resources and
capacities. Keeping these caveats in mind, we lay out the basic rules of
thumb for economic reconstruction below.
Three overarching themes to keep in mind in this are the need for
1. realistic expectations
2. clear measures of success (including simple measures sometimes
referred to as metrics)
3. simplicity and flexibility.
Expectations are a problem. Too often, those involved in stabil-
ity and reconstruction programs have unreasonable expectations about
what is possible—or, at least, about how quickly progress can be made.
If nominal expectations are set too high, then “failures” will occur,
undercutting political support for continued efforts that are, in fact,
paying off (Barton, 2008). Given objectives and expectations, the mea-
sures employed may or may not be the same as those in a normal devel-
opment setting. One reason has been described as follows:
Even the phrase “state building” is grandiose. A more realistic
description would be “jump starting”—helping a people, soci-
ety and government to get going. Foolish overstatements of
grand objectives and temporary improvements breed “gotcha”
news stories and investigations. What must be established is a
“get it started and establish responsible local ownership” attitude.
(Barton, 2008)
The goals and objectives might reflect purely declaratory expecta-
tions of success, but once these goals are declared publicly, they become
the actual expectations of the people at the receiving end of the aid,
whether or not those goals are actually achievable. This is not to sug-
gest that expectations should be set so low as to always be obtainable—
but it might point to the benefit of having a range of goals from mini-
mum acceptable objectives to optimal outcomes. Additionally, it is here
where having good and comprehensive data matters. Even if the out-
comes do not appear to be successful on their own, it is always impor-
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 271
tant to look at them in the context of the outcomes in similar places
that did not benefit from S&R projects.
The need for “simplicity” is often mentioned, almost as a cliché.
We have in mind that strategy should not have too many components
and, certainly, should not be sensitive to intricate interconnections and
subordinate controls. “Moving in the right direction” along several
lines of effort, and “doing essential coordination” conveys the idea.
Imagining complex orchestration, as might be common in a modern
commercial setting, is the opposite. Simplicity has other virtues as well,
of course: It can improve transparency and increase buy-in and support
by local stakeholders.
Finally, plans need to be flexible, especially if it becomes clear that
components or the entirety of ongoing plans are not working. That is, it
is important to plan for adaptation because it will usually be necessary.
Measures to identify failure and enable smooth changes of course need
to be planned and agreed on in advance. Although planners will never
be able to foresee all possible outcomes, it is important to recognize
warning signs along the way that would signal the need for a change of
course. To the extent that plans are simple, they will also be easier to
change along the way.
Role of International Organizations Versus Role of the State
We have discussed extensively the need for international intervenors to
interact with the state and other organizations, but it is useful to lay out
the best-practices role of each of these actors in a post-conflict setting.
Role of the United Nations, Nongovernmental Organizations,
and International Financial Institutions. Ideally, the role of the UN,
international financial institutions, and other aid donors would be to
supervise while the post-crisis governmental institutions implement
the actual reconstruction projects. This “backseat” approach is easiest
to implement in cases where the necessary infrastructure and human
capital existed before the conflict and institutional knowledge has not
been completely destroyed in the conflict. International organizations
must, wherever feasible, work with the state to develop plans for S&R
operations, ensuring that the state is involved and has a clear say on
whether a plan makes sense given the context. The state will likely have
272 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
better knowledge of the situation on the ground, including possible pit-
falls, than will foreign planners (Del Castillo, 2008; Ohiorhenuan and
Stewart, 2008). Further, to the extent that the government is associated
with operations that are providing jobs and accomplishing something,
it strengthens the state itself. Although that might seem obvious, it is
in practice all too easy for outsiders to plunge into S&R projects inde-
pendently, which undercuts the political aspects of S&R.
Some S&R missions reflect an alternative, more intrusive role for
international agencies than has previously been common. In partic-
ular, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET) and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK) assumed some or all of the sovereign powers
during their operations. While these worked out in the end (for the
most part) in terms of a sustained peace and stability, they had other
drawbacks. For instance, Kosovo, which experienced $577 annual
assistance per capita over the first two years of operations (Dobbins
et al., 2005), is still heavily dependent on international aid, in part
because it grew accustomed to the role of the international agency as
dominant.
East Timor, which saw $240 in annual assistance per capita over
the first two years of operations (Dobbins et al., 2008b), did relatively
well after the UN intervention, aside from some renewed riots in 2002
and 2003. While it is best to minimize the role of international inter-
venors to avoid later dependencies, it may not be possible to cut them
out completely. For instance, upon the independence vote in East
Timor, 8,000 Indonesian civil servants promptly left the country, leav-
ing a vacuum in the civil administration that the UN was forced to fill
(Dobbins et al., 2005). In situations like this, there may be no escaping
a heavy role for the intervenor.
To the extent feasible, then, the UN system, nongovernmental
organizations, and other international financial institutions should
take on the role of facilitating, coordinating, and monitoring the inter-
national community’s technical and financial support (Del Castillo,
2008). The greatest help to a transitioning power is in training the
civil servants and politicians who will run the social services, banks,
and other governmental institutions after the international forces leave.
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 273
Additionally, intervenors should monitor the use of aid money and
help resolve and overcome barriers that prevent the money from going
where and doing what it should.
Another tool gaining popularity in helping donors coordinate
their activities are multidonor trust funds, which (despite criticisms
mentioned earlier) allow all donors to a certain region to compile their
money and use the common fund to support needed programs. This
allows money to flow where and when it is most needed and prevents
some of the problems of coordination mentioned earlier (Ohiorhenuan
and Stewart, 2008).
Role of the Post-Conflict State and Local Government. Perhaps
the first and primary role of the state in the post-conflict period is to
establish security and to promote the rule of law (although this may
depend on substantial assistance for intervening forces). The challenge
of establishing security is described in Chapter Two of this volume.
Here, let it suffice for us to mention that some combination of state
and local governments are in the best position to assume the role of
protector and that doing so bolsters citizens’ trust of the government
and its intentions.
Turning now to the state’s role in economic matters, even if the
post-conflict state is largely nonfunctional in terms of human and physi-
cal capital, it may be either taking the lead or preparing to take the lead
in implementing S&R programs with the help of outside intervenors.
If unable to take complete control, it should at least take ownership of
the programs in name and participate to the extent possible. The state
(to include local government!) should play a large part in determining
what is or is not appropriate to the particular post-conflict setting and
should express this to donors. By implementing local knowledge, S&R
programs gain acceptance by the beneficiaries and are less likely to
make culturally based mistakes.
Employing inclusionary processes should not be limited to the
make-up of the security forces. The state should seek to work with all
parties of the prior conflict. This includes the establishment of a “social
contract” that clearly lays out “the reciprocation between the state’s
provision of security, justice and economic opportunity and citizens’
acceptance of the authority of the state” (Ohiorhenuan and Stewart,
274 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
2008). This contract, as well as all policies that the government adopts,
should be laid out in plain language and presented publicly. The state
might want to invite civil-society partners to help disseminate this
information to the public through education campaigns.
Another essential component of a state’s role in reconstruction
is to build its core capacities. The state should focus on providing the
basic needs and necessities of the public, which include having an effec-
tive and responsive civil service. A strong civil service bureaucracy is
what will allow the state to continue its functions seamlessly as leaders
change and as intervenors pull their experts out (Elbadawi, 2008). The
civil service, as the name implies, exists to serve the civilian population,
and the public should perceive that it deserves its name: The public
should see that it is getting the services from their government that jus-
tify the associated taxation, which is economically essential. The civil-
ian population, then, needs to understand what the government does
with the people’s tax dollars, why and how it is doing it, and how the
people are benefiting (Aron, 2003). This openness and transparency of
the government and willingness to involve the public can produce the
“peace dividend” required to maintain stability (Collier, 2000). If the
state is not seen to be acting in the best interest of the people, they may
be less inclined to join the formal economy and support the rebuilding
of the post-conflict state.
Finally, the state should work toward building economic oppor-
tunities by establishing clear and stable property rights, strengthening
opportunities for lending and borrowing, and controlling corruption,
all of which are basic requirements for economic activity to evolve in
any given setting, and even more so in post-conflict environments.
Basic Institutional Framework
Functions. It is crucial to the long-term health of the post-conflict
nation—or, indeed, any nation—to build a solid institutional frame-
work that can carry on functioning as time passes and leaders change.
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 275
For this to happen, there needs to be solid physical infrastructure and
physical security as well as a good supply of human capital, financial
resources, and an institutional network that covers the country. It is
through these assets that goods and services can be distributed and
revenue can be collected, and these activities are crucial both for near-
term recovery and long-term sustainability.
A step in building this framework can be massive public-works
projects * that build on what is left of a country’s infrastructure. If com-
munities within a country are physically or otherwise disconnected, it
is very difficult to support domestic markets, provide services to those
who are farther afield, and collect revenues from the entire territory. A
lack of infrastructure and services also has political implications, as it
casts doubt on the level of governance and sovereignty over a country’s
entire area. Additionally, conflicts could emerge where some commu-
nities are isolated and neglected. Such was the case in Darfur, where
the Sudan Liberation Army and Justice and Equality Movement’s
rebels began attacking government military and police outposts in the
remote western Sudan. Their officially stated reason was that the cen-
tral government was not providing for the region’s well-being (Reuters,
2010). That conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, caus-
ing numerous deaths and deteriorating health conditions along the way
and in refugee camps in neighboring Chad.
Building infrastructure that reaches all parts of a country is not
easy, especially where some countries have vast deserts or densely for-
ested jungles. Nevertheless, the central government must find a way
to serve all of these areas. When the government does not have con-
trol over an area, parallel mechanisms arise to provide the most essen-
tial goods and services that the government is meant to provide. This
undermines a government’s legitimacy, and so reliance on such paral-
lel mechanisms should be avoided in the mid to long term, although
during the period in which the government is building capacity from
* These should usually be left to the international financial institutions mentioned earlier and
accomplished with loans rather than, e.g., bilateral U.S. grant aid (exceptions may be neces-
sary for roads). They should include provisions for maintenance.
276 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
a low base, it may have no choice but to rely on parallel mechanisms
(Ohiorhenuan and Stewart, 2008).
It is important to address early on the mechanisms by which the
state will operate in a post-conflict situation. This could include design-
ing a system from scratch or drawing on prewar structures and prac-
tices, provided that they were not overly problematic or the cause for
the conflict in the first place (Ohiorhenuan and Stewart, 2008). As
discussed in Chapter Three, a country will want to plan what kind
of government it will have (presidential, parliamentary, or other) and
then what cabinet ministries it will need (Security, Foreign Relations,
Economy, Finance, etc.). It is critical to plan how these ministries will
interact with each other and how and whether they will be a part of
the post-conflict S&R projects. One idea, for example, is to have a
temporary cabinet ministry that deals solely with reconstruction (Del
Castillo, 2008). This could allow for a single point of contact between
the donors and the government, which would handle aid coordination
and communication, limiting potential duplication of effort and pre-
venting aid projects from working at cross purposes to one another. All
effort should be made to ensure that ease of knowledge transfer among
these different agencies or ministries is smooth and transparent, both
to people within the system and to the public (Rodrik, Subramanian,
and Trebbi, 2004; Rose-Ackerman, 2008). The planning and training
stage is the point at which it would be optimal to avoid potential com-
partmentalization, as discussed earlier.
Once the state framework is developed, human capital is needed
to organize and direct the institutions of the state. Again, if the nec-
essary educated workforce that existed prior to the conflict survived
and has not fled the country, it will be faster to ramp up to full capac-
ity. However, if the remaining available human capital is too low, the
next step the state must take is to build an educated civil service that
can run the day-to-day operations in the ministries. Building this kind
of competent workforce will be time-consuming, and this is exactly
where technical assistance and training would be a very appropriate
form of aid.
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 277
Macroeconomic Policymaking
In a chapter on economic issues, the most basic question to ask early
in a post-conflict situation is, How should the state be involved in the
economy? Post-conflict markets are generally not going to be efficient
markets; it takes time for markets to reach an equilibrium, and, as dis-
cussed earlier, distortionary measures may be unavoidable (those for
jump-starting). Thus the question remains, To what extent should a
government interfere with the markets? For instance, to what extent
should the government privatize or liberalize for the sake of economic
efficiency? This should be decided by the state, while considering rec-
ommendations from the international community and the national
context and taking into account the situation prior to the conflict.
Whatever the state decides, the first step is to establish solid rule-
of-law policies so that any regulation can be enforceable (Del Castillo,
2008). If regulation is not in place, liberalization or privatization has
the possibility of going very wrong. The rule of law, as discussed earlier,
should be interpreted to mean the presence of sound and enforceable
contract law and acceptance by the state of long-term international
obligations that transcend leadership, in addition to achieving security
and having the bulk of the economy follow legitimate paths rather than
those of the black market or crime. Unless the government can show
that it has control over the economy and that investors will be able
to enter into contracts knowing that their rights will be upheld, then
economic S&R cannot succeed (Hamre and Sullivan, 2002; Rose-
Ackerman, 2008).
The most important institution that will deal with macroeco-
nomic policymaking is the central bank. Such a bank’s role includes
the following (see, among many others, Addison, Le Billon, and Mur-
shed, 2001; Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000; Ohiorhenuan and Stew-
art, 2008):
1. establishing a currency
2. protecting the integrity of that currency
3. rebuilding the domestic financial and banking sector to permit
and protect investments
278 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
4. helping to ensure sustainable systems of intermediation to dis-
tribute money from lenders to borrowers.
These activities are central to economic recovery and a vital role of
a central bank. Poorly resourced or undertrained central banks provide
only weak regulation and are therefore a dangerous liability to stabil-
ity, investment, and sustainability (Addison et al., 2001; Adam, Col-
lier, and Davies, 2008). Given its key importance to economic recov-
ery, intervenors and their government partners should quickly reopen
banks, if they are closed, but then take the time to thoroughly plan and
implement banking reforms and recapitalization (Addison et al., 2001).
Another role of the central bank should be to attain or restore
trust and credibility to the monetary system. The “fight against infla-
tion” is a long-term fight and it requires a long-term framework for
success, but a credible monetary policy must also balance price stabil-
ity concerns with the need for liquidity jump-start development and
attenuate employment concerns (Del Castillo, 2008; Ohiorhenuan and
Stewart, 2008). Post-conflict settings are different than in a normal
development context where there is less of a need to “jump-start” devel-
opment as much as to just continue with the development process. It
is important to note that dealing with monetary policy is, as stated, a
long-term fight, and states should consider this as a second-order pri-
ority, to be dealt with after basic economic activity has been restored.
Finally, a sound fiscal policy is important in creating a sustain-
able state. Allocating the national budget is a difficult political process
that takes serious planning and practice. Fiscal prudence is also a long-
term effort. It can be difficult to even gauge the levels of revenue and
expenditures that are needed or available when a new government is
first taking over. It may be necessary to create shorter-term budgets to
begin with, because in the first few years of a transition, needs might
be changing rapidly (Del Castillo, 2008). Starting out with relatively
crude but frequent (quarterly or semiannual) budgets might be useful.
Also, post-conflict countries will often have a significant amount of
debt (Barro and Lee, 2005). Timely payment of these debts will help
maintain good donor relations and will extend the likelihood of fur-
ther aid in the future. Cooperation and guidance from international
Establishing Desirable Economic Conditions 279
financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, should
be sought in cases of significant external-debt-to-gross-domestic-prod-
uct ratio.
Microeconomic Policymaking
Employment and private-sector development are necessary for sus-
tained economic recovery. To achieve them, states and intervenors
must engender trust from the business community, remove obstacles to
economic activity, provide incentives for business activity, and provide
direct support to businesses or individuals if needed (Ohiorhenuan
and Stewart, 2008). Policies promoting employment and private-sector
development are tied to the institutional factors and macroeconomic
factors.
A good business climate is characterized by a number of factors
(Porter, 2003):
1. clearly explicated rules and regulations that are transparently
and consistently enforced
2. low amounts of government bureaucracy
3. strong judicial systems and strong rule of law
4. flexible and productive labor markets and available human
capital
5. good physical infrastructure
6. investment in innovation and technological infrastructure
7. fair competition (lack of monopolies, informal markets, etc.).
All of these factors relate to the ease of doing business and are
necessary to support and encourage local investment and entrepreneur-
ship along with international commercial investment. In previous sec-
tions, we have discussed how rule of law affects the economy: Without
a strong rule of law, businesses might be hesitant to invest in a country,
as it is not clear to what extent regulations are enforceable. Business also
needs resources, both physical and human capital, in order to function.
These may not be available in the short term, depending on the amount
of destruction and migration, but efforts to start building or rebuild-
ing the human capital should begin immediately. Markets require all
280 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
these factors in order to function and provide the trade opportunities
that are required to stabilize and reconstruct post-conflict economies
(Dollar and Kraay, 2003).
Alternative Funding Mechanisms. Aside from business invest-
ment, another way to boost domestic markets is to use microfinance
and remittances. Microfinance has been shown to directly produce eco-
nomic activities, though most microcredit schemes are still highly sub-
sidized. There has been some complaint that “designers and sponsors of
new initiatives have abandoned innovation, and ‘replication’ is leading
to a growing uniformity in financial interventions” (Morduch, 2000),
but this method of getting small loans to entrepreneurs and small busi-
ness owners has nevertheless been shown to have great promise.
Remittances can also help finance economic recovery. Somaliland
over the past 17 years has managed to establish a degree of security and
effective governance in a conflict-riddled region that was mainly due
to remittances from the diaspora population (Figure 6.3). In this time,
Somaliland’s health provision and primary school enrollment have risen,

poverty levels have fallen, and these indicators are on par with regional
neighbors that have not experienced similar conflict (Ohiorhenuan and
Stewart, 2008). Research suggests that part of the reason for Somali-
land’s growth is due to regional, clan-based credit systems, which
help protect assets and settle disputes. Additionally, remittances have
helped not just with household consumption but also financing small
business development (Ohiorhenuan and Stewart, 2008). On a global
scale, remittances run in the tens of billions of dollars annually (though
currently the top recipients of remittances are not the poorest coun-
tries) and have a significant impact on income and consumption in
many developing nations (Addison, Mavrotas, and McGillivray, 2005;
Ratha, 2005). The Somali example shows how a relatively simple tool
such as remittances can operate in concert with local traditions and
experiences to help economic growth and reconstruction.
Though local actors and resources are critical for the success of
economic reconstruction, local efforts are not always sufficient on their
own and should be used in concert with valuable external assistance.
These various tools, actors, and resources should work in complemen-
tary ways to provide a whole range of policy options with which to
tackle the difficult problems associated with transitioning to peace.
Conclusions
We have discussed the different factors that contribute to economic
stability and reconstruction at length. These factors can be put into
a system of relationships that are shown in Figure 6.1. However, the
factor tree in Figure 6.1 could be true for either post-conflict or normal
development settings. There are four main differences between these
two situations that affect how Figure 6.1 should be viewed:
1. Intensity. In post-conflict settings, there is urgent and immi-
nent need to get control of the security situation, build/rebuild
human capital, and establish the rule of law.
2. Timing. Some factors must be tended to before success on the
others will be possible. Security must be assured before markets
282 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
can function properly. It is also important to attract back highly
skilled refugees and establish rule of law, whereas more general
human capital development is a longer-term goal. Other fac-
tors, such as investment, fiscal policy adjustment, and rebuild-
ing infrastructure, must also come immediately, whereas recon-
struction of monetary policy might be more mid- to near-term
factors.
3. Type of Aid. Post-conflict settings are targets for security aid in
addition to the usual development aid. Security aid will come in
quickly and in high volumes; it requires immediate use before
the wells of international interest dry up. A low, steady flow of
development aid may continue, but the window for high levels
of security aid will be narrower.
4. Appropriate Market Systems. Short-term measures that econo-
mists usually do not favor may be necessary. These include
distortionary policies (such as subsidies and direct transfers of
cash or food) and government nationalization of services (such
as utilities) or production of natural resources. Countries and
intervenors must have a solid plan, from the inception, for the
transition to more economically optimal strategies.

As emphasized throughout this chapter, some outcomes must be
achieved before others are achievable; security, for instance, is the pre-
cursor to almost everything else. The timing of the factors and levels of
intensity that they require in a post-conflict situation will be roughly
what is shown in Figure 6.4. This differs from a normal development
context in a number of ways: Security will likely be a higher-intensity
priority for a post-conflict country, which may still be experiencing the
aftershocks of the conflict, whereas fiscal policy might be more urgent
in a normal development context, as budgetary discipline in a post-
conflict setting will be put off to the mid term. These are general priori-
ties, of course, because every post-conflict reconstruction setting will
be different, depending on the history of the conflict and other factors.
Endnotes
1 The factor-tree methodology is discussed succinctly in Davis (2009) and at more
length in Chapter 11 of Davis and Cragin (2009). Briefly, an arrow from factor A to
factor B means that an increase in the former tends to increase the latter, although
the actual effect will depend on other factors that also influence B.
2 The degree and nature of adherence is never perfect, of course.
3 Corruption is a matter of degree. In some states it is common to have multiple
payments in the course of business, payments that may be considered as either bribes
(corruption) or informal transaction fees of a less troublesome nature. However,
when the extent and magnitude of these payments becomes excessive and the result-
ing processes inefficient, and when a significant portion of the money goes into the
foreign accounts of leaders, corruption severely affects the state’s economy. Corrup-
tion indexes have been constructed to characterize degree on a country-by-country
basis (see, e.g., the website of Transparency International).

CHAPTER SEVEN
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas
Claude Berrebi and Véronique Thelen*
Introduction
One of the primary whole-of-government instruments for stability and
reconstruction (S&R) operations is foreign assistance. However, social-
science research reveals serious uncertainties and disagreements about
the role and effectiveness of aid; it also raises what can be seen as recur-
ring dilemmas, or at least tensions. This chapter attempts to synthe-
size the related literature and clarify selected issues, primarily for the
purpose of informing government officials concerned with S&R. The
chapter is organized as follows:
1. Background on Foreign Assistance and Its Effectiveness
2. Using Conditionalities to Improve Effectiveness
3. Reconciling Short- and Long-Term Objectives
4. Improving Effectiveness by Using More Objective Criteria for
Aid
5. Whether to Provide Aid Through the Government or Around It.
We then end with brief conclusions, including some cautions
about using aggregated quantitative methods when assessing options
for specific countries.

Background on Foreign Assistance and Its Effectiveness
Types of Aid
Foreign aid can be categorized by a number of methods. The U.S. Con-
gress refers to five types: bilateral development assistance, economic aid
supporting U.S. security objectives, humanitarian assistance, multilat-
eral assistance, and military assistance (Tarnoff and Nowels, 2004).
The names used for these categories can be confusing; Table 7.1 is our
attempt to clarify distinctions. The number of bullets indicates the rel-
ative degree to which aid in one of these categories affects the functions
shown in the top row. The composition of foreign aid varies over time,
of course; Figure 7.1 illustrates the breakdown for 2008 (Tarnoff and
Lawson, 2009).
Within post conflict environments (a subset of the total aid in
Figure 7.1), the United States employs all five types of aid, but bilateral

development assistance and economic security aid are primary. The
coexistence of normal economic-development aid and S&R-related aid
is unique to post-conflict states and presents a hazard: The functions
associated with the two types of aid may be in contradiction.
The level of foreign aid varies tremendously across states, with
such states as Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and East Timor receiving large
quantities of aid while others receive relatively scant funding (Collier
and Hoeffler, 2004).
Other distinctions are also important when performing evalua-
tions. Suhrke and Buckmaster (2005) distinguish among types of aid,
between commitments and disbursements, and among different levels
and timings of aid.
Normal development aid and post-conflict (S&R) aid are fre-
quently implemented by different institutions and with contrasting
mechanisms. S&R aid aims to diminish the likelihood of renewed
violence and to enhance the legitimacy and operation of the central
government. It frequently seeks results as soon as possible. The physi-
cal projects that receive funding are often related (especially in early
periods) to the needs of military and police forces.1 Countries with the
greatest relevance to the donor’s geopolitical interests and security can

expect the greatest amount of aid. The U.S. Departments of State and
Defense implement most S&R aid (Tarnoff and Nowels, 2004).
Normal development aid operates on a longer timeline, which
can be a decade or more. The aid investments are often in projects
that target economic growth and poverty and frequently involve state
infrastructure improvements and agricultural advancement. In prin-
ciple, development aid allocation is linked with liberal political and
economic policies of the recipient country. Major U.S. agencies that
specialize in development aid are the Millennium Challenge Corpo-
ration (MCC) (discussed in a later section) and the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) (Tarnoff, 2009).
Motivations and Objectives
The objectives of aid and the reasons for its allocation are many, and
they are not solely, or even particularly, those of poverty alleviation or
promotion of economic development.
Empirical analysis is one way to understand de facto objectives.
Kang and Meernick (2004) use historical data and statistical methods
to infer the determinants of foreign assistance by the nations of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
to nations involved in conflicts. As expected, humanitarian needs and
economic conditions affect the level of aid. Also, OECD assistance is
significantly greater in post-conflict years, particularly where OECD
members have intervened militarily. Donor actions are also guided by
donor assessments of the immediate economic and human needs, a
sense of responsibility, and possible long-term benefits or interests for
the region. Broadly speaking, then, objectives seem to be benign and
even altruistic. However, deeper analysis reveals additional motives,
which can undercut some aspects of S&R and affect judgments about
the rationality of how aid has been allocated. These motives include
supporting governments that are under political threat where stability
is a matter of U.S. concern, pursuing commercial interests, subsidiz-
ing counterterrorism, and rewarding nations for international coop-
eration. 2,3 Overall, the literature suggests that allocation of foreign aid
responds primarily to certain national-strategic motivations, rather
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 295
than to the likely performance of recipient countries in combating pov-
erty and furthering growth.
Some authors draw ethical conclusions from this, while others
regard these correlations as natural. Why wouldn’t a nation’s foreign
aid move preferentially to countries with which there are historical ties
(e.g., a former colony)? Why shouldn’t a nation be more charitable if
it perceives the likelihood of future commerce with the recipient state?
We (the present authors) are not concerned here with assessing the ethi-
cal merits of de facto aid policies, but rather with noting that they are
sometimes at odds with the economic effectiveness in S&R narrowly.
Thus, assessments of “effectiveness” are more complicated that some
authors have suggested.
Studies of the effectiveness of combined U.S. foreign aid reach
varied conclusions. Matters become even more complicated for post-
conflict settings, in which humanitarian and development aid is
integrated with stabilization and military aid. The threat of violence
shortly after war frequently requires using military personnel to deliver
or accompany delivery of humanitarian aid. In Iraq and Afghanistan,
Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) have both military personnel
and civilians from the State Department, USAID, and the Department
of Agriculture. The teams have a hybrid mission consisting of reconcili-
ation promotion, counterinsurgency, and fostering economic growth
and development (Clawson, 2010a).
With this background, let us now discuss the long-standing issue
of aid’s effectiveness.
Controversy About Effectiveness and Efficiency
The “aid-ineffectiveness literature” has accumulated evidence that for-
eign aid does not consistently or efficiently reduce poverty or enhance
education in the recipient countries.
Easterly (2007) presents a synthesis of this literature and argues
that the failure of aid to reduce poverty is due to (1) specific economic
constraints and conditions and (2) incentive systems that are either
inappropriate or lacking entirely. He argues that corruption, lack of
property rights and contract enforcement, and the ineffectiveness of
aid-recipient governments in providing services strongly contribute to
296 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
aid’s ineffectiveness. These economic conditions are even more impor-
tant in the case of fragile-state or post-conflict reconstruction. Security,
stability, and the quality of institutions are at least as important.
Beyond ineffectiveness, another issue is the risk that foreign aid
will be downright counterproductive, with conflict renewing if the
population does not perceive a “peace dividend” (Del Castillo, 2008) or
if aid creates a “moral hazard,” i.e., generating disincentives for stability
by reducing the costs to participants of renewed war (Benmelech, Ber-
rebi, and Klor, 2010). Even worse, aid can become an asset for people
to fight over (Zoellick, 2008).
This aid-ineffectiveness literature also raises the question of why
the international community consistently gives away billions of dollars
if such a flow of aid is ineffective. A possible answer is that—as dis-
cussed in the previous section—the objectives of aid are many, and are
not solely, or even particularly, those of poverty alleviation or promo-
tion of economic development.
In any case, considerable effort has been made to assess the effects
of development aid on conflict and post-conflict S&R. In this connec-
tion, de Ree and Nillesen (2009) explore the effect on state conflicts,
specifically sub-Saharan civil wars. According to their study, develop-
ment aid is negatively correlated to the duration of civil war. More
precisely, a 10 percent increase in aid is correlated with an 8 percent
smaller probability of war continuation (they did not find a correlation
between the onset of civil conflict and development aid).
Conflicting Results. Statistical studies of the impact of foreign aid
at the micro and macro levels have often contradicted one another. For
example, Hansen and Tarp (2001) look at the relation between aid and
growth using the measure of real gross domestic product per capita.
Their results show that the impact of aid on growth is highly sensitive
to the empirical approach of the analysis and can lead to opposing con-
clusions on the effectiveness of foreign aid, depending on the estima-
tion technique used and the set of control variables included (e.g., the
level of domestic investment, human capital, or foreign direct invest-
ment). Easterly (2003) explains these contradictory results by show-
ing that the impact of aid on economic growth is sensitive to reason-
able variations in the definitions of the variable used and to the period
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 297
considered. His work calls into question the considerable econometric
analysis that does not adequately address such sensitivities.
These different results on the impact of foreign aid on stability,
growth, and poverty are not surprising given the heterogeneous nature
of aid, motives, and timeframes—as well as limitations of tools being
used. Sound quantitative analysis of the effects of aid targeted toward
state-building requires aid data at the locality or project level, as well
as measures of institutional quality and state capacity, both of which
are rarely available. Moreover, the complex causality chain linking the
allocation of foreign aid to final outcomes has been often ignored.
As another example of how tensions arise among studies, Azam
and Delacroix (2006) and Azam and Thelen (2008, 2010) look at mea-
sures to curb the flow of terrorist attacks by intervening directly in
the perpetrators’ countries of origin. Their theoretical framework views
aid, in part, as a way of defraying the cost of the recipient government
of protecting the donor’s interests by fighting terrorist organizations
that would otherwise target the interests of the donor country. They
found, using both the official development assistance (ODA) measure
per capita and as a percentage of gross domestic product, that foreign
aid can be efficient for fighting terrorism. In contrast, they found that
military intervention has ambiguous impact. One of their key findings
(again, hardly a surprise) was that donor countries are using foreign
aid as a tool to fight terrorism. The donor community is preferentially
allocating aid to governments facing more militant groups likely to use
terrorism in the first place.
As shown by Azam and Delacroix, however, by not using proper
specification and controls, they could find the spurious result that more
foreign aid led statistically to more terrorist attacks. These papers high-
light the importance of having a theoretical foundation and of using
sound empirical methods. Unfortunately, the literature sometimes falls
short, particularly by using highly aggregated data. One must be aware
of conclusions of narrowly sound statistical analysis that can be trans-
lated into seriously incorrect policy implications.4 Better methods are
available and should be used.
Given these caveats about understanding “normal” aid effective-
ness, care should be taken when assessing options for post-conflict aid
298 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
using so-called common knowledge, especially knowledge derived from
the over-aggregated analysis mentioned above. To be blunt, analysis
needs to address the specific goals and circumstances of the country in
question for it to be useful as a basis for assessing policy options.
Using Conditionalities to Improve Effectiveness
Drawing on the ineffectiveness-of-aid literature, a natural conclusion is
that aid should be tied to explicit or implicit past performance criteria
or to the expected future performance of the recipient governments.
Conditionality is increasingly used to support medium-term reforms
(World Bank, 2005). Such conditionality refers to conditions attached
to the disbursements of policy-based lending or budget support. Con-
ditionality along these lines is particularly relevant for post-conflict
countries and may also help control corruption.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank often use
the conditionality of aid for short-term stabilization purposes and for
longer-term structural adjustment. Bilateral donors also use various
kinds of conditionalities to pursue rather commercial or geopolitical
objectives, such as agreement to purchase goods and services produced
by the donor country.
In the context of S&R, one aim of imposing conditionality is
that it may force the recipient government to make decisions in the
broader public interest, which in turn may help prevent another con-
flict. Unfortunately, the social science tells us that doing so has many
problems and dilemmas.
Del Castillo (2008) points out possible downsides of conditionali-
ties, such as detrimental effects on immediate humanitarian assistance.
The question is, When and what types of conditions on foreign aid are
useful in post-conflict countries? For example, should conditionality
be on the institutional efforts of the government, on its economic and
reconstruction efforts made, or both?
Adding to the complexity, a World Bank (2003b) study suggested
that it takes about three years before assistance starts having any kind
of impact. Also, in post-conflict situations, the time needed for insti-
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 299
tutional reforms to take effect is often longer than the time required
for the flow of reconstruction aid to begin implementation. Therefore,
any conditionality on foreign aid assistance that is linked to institu-
tional reforms (e.g., those promoting rule of law, an equalitarian and
functional electoral system, or proper civil rights) needs to be using
reasonable time scales and metrics of performance that reflect expected
delays. As discussed in Chapter One of this volume, such consider-
ations argue strongly for at least high-level depiction of system dynam-
ics when developing measures of effectiveness and performance. Oth-
erwise, interim monitoring will lead to misleading conclusions.
Boyce (2007) also addresses conditionality, noting again that
peace and stability are not always the sole or even the dominant objec-
tives of the donor community. A donor may be concerned, for exam-
ple, with geopolitical, economic, and commercial interests, or may
be responding to other concerns of domestic public opinion (e.g., the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS or a natural disaster). In this context Boyce
explains the roles of economic assistance and conditionality in improv-
ing the peacebuilding process. One of his ideas is to impose condition-
ality on types of aid that are most valued by political leaders while least
damaging to the overall population. He maintains that such condi-
tionality should only be applied to nonhumanitarian aid, although he
recognizes the difficulties in making the distinctions.
Since conditionalities are developed on a case-by-case basis, flex-
ibility exists. There are, however, potential additional problems that
have attracted attention. Dreher (2002) shows that the number of con-
ditionality criteria of the World Bank and the International Mone-
tary Fund has increased over time. These apply primarily to mone-
tary and fiscal policy, reduction in relative price distortions, reductions
in public-sector budget deficits, reduction of current account deficits
through import substitution and export promotion, and privatizations.
Many of these conditionalities can be quite inappropriate economi-
cally to post-conflict settings (see also Chapter Six), quite aside from
the exceptional monitoring difficulties that also exist (World Bank,
2003a). Another major criticism of conditionality approaches is that,
while they add complexity and delays, noncompliance has not always
been rigorously punished, resulting in costs but few benefits. This
300 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
imperfect control of implementation and imperfect knowledge of the
local environment raise serious doubts about the wisdom of imposing
aid conditionality in the first place. The tactic may be the least bad of
numerous bad options, so long as it does not impede humanitarian
efforts or other short-term S&R objectives, but better methods need to
be used in defining conditions, monitoring developments, and inter-
preting information.
Reconciling Short-Term and Longer-Term Objectives
Sources of Tension
A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report on post-
conflict economic recovery (2007) gives a good overview of the inter-
connected cyclical conditions for rebuilding and sustaining peace. The
report sensibly argues that economic recovery can lead to reconstruc-
tion, income generation, and improved public services, which in turn
will enhance economic recovery. The report also discusses the impor-
tance of local institutions and infrastructures, especially for the health
and education sectors, since these can substantially benefit from for-
eign aid. The report finds a correlation between countries’ income
and wealth inequalities and their predisposition to conflict. It accord-
ingly suggests that post-conflict aid policies should aim to reduce such
inequalities and tension. Foreign aid and debt relief are viewed as ways
to provide a “breathing space” for governments to use in building polit-
ical consensus and restoring institutional capacities. The report, how
ever, does not emphasize the practical tensions between the long term eco
nomic recovery and the immediate needs faced by post conflict economies.
Such tensions can aggravate inequalities and renew conflict.
Trade-offs exist between the short-run and long-run objectives
of post-conflict foreign aid. To be sure, foreign assistance may pursue
short-run objectives, mainly humanitarian and reconstruction-oriented
in nature, but also long-run objectives focused on development and
peacebuilding. However, in a budget-constrained environment, one
objective comes at the expense of the other. Moreover, policies required
for short-term objectives are often detrimental to achieving long-term
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 301
goals (e.g., providing free food and shelter to relieve humanitarian
crises will reduce incentives to commercial providers of food and shel-
ter, as well as diminish the urgency of finding employment). Similarly,
policies required for achieving long-term objectives are often in con-
flict with the short-term needs (e.g., fiscal and monetary constraints to
establish economic credibility and control inflation conflict with the
provision of immediate government services to the population). Ambi-
guity of strategy and mission objectives can lead to development teams
favoring quick action over long-term impact aid projects, as was well
documented in a report on the integration of development and security
assistance (Morrison and Hicks, 2008).
Failures of “Political Markets” Affecting Short- and Long-Term
Prospects
Keefer (2008) argues that, in post-conflict countries, prospects for
peace and development depend sensitively on the political institutions
and “political-market imperfections.” These have effects in both the
short and longer terms, as well as in the transitions between them.
Keefer and Khemani (2005) and Keefer (2008) study the impact of
four political-market imperfections on the incentives of politicians to
provide public goods:
1. Asymmetries of Information: Citizens cannot easily observe the
specific contributions of politicians to public policy and the
quality of public goods. Nor can they easily assess the quality of
public goods. As a result, politicians have less incentive to pro-
vide what they have promised or to assure quality.
2. Social Polarization: Ethnic, linguistic, religious, and economic
heterogeneity can affect political behavior inappropriately.
3. The Noncredibility of Political Promises: Politicians may simply
be unable to make credible promises, leading to insurgency.
4. Coercion in Elections: The continued use of violence to gain elec-
toral support or to undermine the opponents distorts political
functioning.
302 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
These political-market imperfections distort development pros-
pects and decrease political incentives to pursue the broad public inter-
est, including peace and development.
What can be done to reduce such political-market imperfec-
tions? Drawing on Keefer’s discussion, a number of possibilities can be
listed. Donors can target the imperfections by increasing information
and credibility. Aid conditions can encourage concrete and observable
actions to reduce political-market imperfections. When the govern-
ment is unable to serve and protect the interests of its citizens, the more
effective way to improve the welfare of the citizens is humanitarian
assistance provided directly by the donors. With less political imperfec-
tion, donors can rely on the government to channel aid, if the policy
instruments are observable and if they do not require high government
capacity. In this case, aside from funneling money and aid to the gov-
ernment for immediate purposes, donors can focus their strategies on
long-run development and peacebuilding objectives. Table 7.2 sum-
marizes our appreciation of these distinctions. Each row is a different
case, with a preferred relative emphasis on either short- or long-term
emphasis, and with different prescriptions for going through or around
the government. The first row corresponds to a case with low levels of
governance and capacity. In this case, the aid strategy should be tilted
toward the short term, i.e., toward jump-starting. Much of it will need
to go directly to the population, as when military and other interna-
tional organizations pass out food and water, establish sanitation, and
generally attend to the most fundamental necessities while also seeking
to build governance capacities for the longer term. In contrast, when
governance is relatively higher (row 4), the emphasis should be on the
longer term, and aid should be funneled through the government, in
part to improve its perceived effectiveness and legitimacy and in part
to lay the basis for sustained development without foreign assistance.
The two objectives of building peace and fostering economic
recovery may be seen as complementary. Economic recovery and recon-
struction without a peacebuilding or peacekeeping process is unlikely
to succeed, and vice versa. Collier and Hoeffler (2004) examined the
relationship between aid, economic growth, and economic-policy vari-
ables in countries that have emerged from civil war. Their objective
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 303
was to identify the optimal timing and magnitude of aid in relation
to economic growth. They argue that aid reduces the risk of conflict
recurrence, although this result is still debated in the literature. Suhrke,
Villanger, and Woodward (2005) demonstrate that the result is not
“robust to specification changes” (i.e., it depends on details of method-
ology, such as selection and coding of data, the form of the assumed
regression model, and aggregations). For example, using the same sta-
tistical methods while varying specifications, they find, in contrast to
Collier and Hoeffler (2004), that aid has an impact on growth during
the fifth to eight years after peace but not during the first four years.
Furthermore, they show that variation in the timeframe of the data
sample used can lead to large variation in the possible effect of extra aid
on growth, down to no effect at all.
Demekas, McHugh, and Kosma (2002) use a theoretical model
to understand the impact of different types of aid on capital accumu-
lation, growth, welfare, and resource allocation. The model assumes
that post-conflict aid differs from conventional development aid with
respect to goal, circumstances, and both the size and duration of aid.
They show that post-conflict humanitarian aid is welfare-enhancing
in the short run but does not help capital accumulation and growth in
the long run. Conversely, the allocation of resources to reconstruction

aid encourages capital stock but does not address the recipient coun-
try’s immediate needs. This work shows, theoretically, the value of dis-
tinguishing between the types of post-conflict aid to fully understand
impacts.
Mlambo, Kamara, and Nyende (2009) found that countries
emerging from conflict require the collaboration of aid agencies with
specialties in economic development, security, and policy advice. They
conclude that for development tools to resolve the tension between
short- and longer-term objectives in post-conflict states, and to break
conflict cycles, they must be paired with peace and security opera-
tions (a conclusion consistent with the overall system perspective of
this volume, as discussed in Chapter One). A qualitative study of aid in
failed states (François and Sud, 2006) concludes that donors ought to
deliver aid only after conflict has subsided and security conditions have
improved, since delivering aid to corrupt and weak national govern-
ments has been largely ineffective. McGillivray and Feeny (2008) sup-
port these findings and empirically demonstrate that “fragile” states, or
those currently engulfed in conflict and instability, use aid less effec-
tively and absorb less aid than other similar, but more secure, states.
Here again, following Table 7.2, providing aid directly to the popula-
tion and working around the potentially corrupt government may be
more efficient and result in better response to the urgent needs. Oxfam
America (2008) calls for a grand national foreign aid strategy so that
greater coherency is brought to the wide variety of U.S. aid operations.
Such a strategy would bring equal consideration to both long-term
development needs and immediate security requirements. The broad
perception that development aid and security aid needs enhanced coor-
dination and integration reflects the underlying belief that the differ-
ent types of aid operate ineffectively or counterproductively when they
exist independent of each other, in part because the timeframe they
address is so different (Clawson, 2010a).
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 305
Making Aid More Effective by Allocating It More
Objectively
One way to improve the effectiveness of S&R aid may be to give it a
more rational basis that considers not only need, but also prospects
for the aid being used well. This suggests looking to the experience of
the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for lessons learned.
Although the MCC itself may not play a role in post-conflict situa-
tions, and thus might be regarded as tangential to the S&R theme of
this chapter, the MCC experience illustrates how aid practices can in
fact change. Further, some of the lessons emerging will likely be rel-
evant to post-conflict S&R.
The proposal to create the Millennium Challenge Corporation
marked a stark departure from traditional U.S. bilateral foreign aid
practices (Radelet, 2003). Established in 2004, MCC’s core philosophy
is that effective foreign aid relies on recipient governments that embrace
free-market principles, transparent democracy, and social investment.
Accordingly, MCC’s aid allocation process vigorously seeks to objec-
tively identify countries that not only demonstrate a need for aid but
also have the promise of dramatic improvement with targeted MCC
investment. The selection process makes use of performance indicators
that provide scores on countries’ political, social, and economic prog-
ress. The countries chosen are then provided with a program of three to
five years funding, which includes detailed investment projects target-
ing growth and development (Tarnoff, 2009).
The MCC allocation of aid seeks to realize three principal
objectives:
• Select recipient countries irrespective of U.S. strategic foreign
policy objectives.
• Invest in economic development projects as a means to relieve
poverty.
• Promote democratic government, social investment, and eco-
nomic openness.
306 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Taking these in order, the MCC attempts to avoid placing undue
value on countries that the United States finds strategically important;
it instead seeks to select recipients based on the countries’ need for aid
and likelihood of success (Radelet, 2003). The MCC attempts to do
so by preferentially investing in countries with liberal economic and
political ideals (e.g. fee markets and democracy), rather than countries
with the greatest poverty.
By awarding aid based on a variety of liberal values, the MCC
hopes to incentivize positive governance and influence supporting
behavior. This objective, whose outcome is sometimes known as the
“MCC effect,” is intended to affect not only the countries that receive
aid, but all candidate countries (Radelet, 2003).
Because of the relatively short history of this program, it is diffi-
cult to evaluate whether or not MCC has been successful in achieving
its objectives. Although outcomes are still being debated, it is already
clear that the MCC’s selection reduces significantly the potential for
politicization. The initial pool of candidate countries to be evaluated by
the MCC is assembled in an objective manner based on countries’ per
capita income as determined by the World Bank. To determine eligibil-
ity, each candidate country then receives scores within the categories
of “ruling justly,” “investing in people,” and “economic freedom.” The
scores are based on 17 performance indicators produced by the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and Freedom House. It is
only after eligible countries submit applications that the MCC’s board
of directors decides whether a country receives aid. There is a potential
risk that the board’s subjective opinion at the last stage will politicize
the process, but evidence suggests that the MCC is acting in accor-
dance with its mission and is largely delivering aid solely on a basis of
need and the criteria mentioned above (Clawson, 2010b).5,6
Unbiased selection is merely a means to an end. The ultimate
question (not yet answerable) remains whether MCC programs will be
successful at alleviating poverty. The MCC’s approach to development
and poverty relies on long-advocated economic principles and is there-
fore attractive. Nonetheless, there have been criticisms and cautions.
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 307
Criticisms and Cautions
Mawdsley (2007) argues that the MCC’s neoliberal approaches to
development can actually exacerbate overall poverty and inequality,
often assisting only small segments of the poor population. Similarly,
Carbone (2004) notes that the selection process overlooks some of the
poorest countries in the world, many of which have made great posi-
tive strides, such as Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia, since they fail one
or more of the MCC’s performance indicators. Johnson and Zajonc
(2007) concluded that it is probably too early to evaluate the MCC’s
effect on poverty, since the benefits of the MCC’s investment projects
are likely not to be evident for years after completion.
Another concern with MCC was that, instead of increasing the
pool of aid resources, it would merely substitute aid from one agency
to another or from one donor to another (Brown, Siddiqi, and Ses-
sions, 2007). However, empirical analysis by Dreher, Nunnenkamp,
and Öhler (2010) finds that the amount of aid received increased across
all eligible countries (i.e., including countries that have not (yet) signed
binding agreements on aid programs with MCC). Also, Dreher, Nun-
nenkamp, and Öhler (2010) conclude that MCC countries not only
benefited in comparison with non-MCC countries but also received
higher aid in absolute terms from all U.S. donors taken together. These
new findings, then, contradict earlier findings of Brown, Siddiqi, and
Sessions (2007).
Finally, it is important to know whether the MCC program has
influenced governments’ behavior by incentivizing democracy, social
progress, and economic openness. The idea was that the MCC would
not only spur meaningful development through direct investment but
also impact the broader developing world through the competition for
aid (MCC, 2007). Johnson and Zajonc (2007) provided the first empir-
ical evidence of such an effect, and the 2008 MCC report provided an
abundance of additional anecdotal evidence to support an effect on
countries competing for aid (Clawson, 2010b). However, once coun-
tries enter an aid agreement with the MCC, the positive effect seems to
diminish, as countries appear to frequently suffer declines in their per-
formance indicators and do not necessarily continue to improve once
aid programs have been accorded (Gootnick, 2008).
308 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
MCC’s future remains unclear. It has remained true to its mission,
but the ambiguity of its effects on poverty alleviation and economic
development, as well as the political, social, and economic reforms
made by candidate countries in order to become eligible, may not be
sufficient to maintain support for the program. In particular, MCC’s
ability to take investment risks and to use innovative approaches may
be compromised by skeptical politicians more interested in traditional
aid practices (Hewko, 2010). This said, the MCC (an initiative of the
administration of George W. Bush) has been publicly applauded by
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Obama administration. She
recently asked for a 15 percent increase in its funding (Clinton, 2010).
As mentioned above, the MCC is not likely to be used for post-conflict
S&R, but the lessons learned from its experiences will be. The MCC
experience demonstrates that aid practices can be reformed. Further, its
approach has structural elements that could more objectively determine
distributions of post-conflict S&R aid in accordance with the specific
goals of the case. Finally, we observe that the MCC is using better and
more reliable econometric tools than those we criticized above (e.g., for
over-aggregation and the ignoring of endogeneity problems).
When Aid-Giving Should or Should Not Go Through the
Recipient Government
The last topic we deal with has to do with how donors should operate
with respect to the recipient government (a topic presaged by Table 7.2).
The donor can deliver assistance to the government or can bypass the
government and fund nongovernmental organizations and other pri-
vate actors. Decisions on the matter can involve dilemmas, because
there are distinct pros and cons and likely side effects of any choice.
The previous sections suggest that whether or not foreign aid
should be directly given to the population or delivered through the
government depends on the short-term and long-term objectives and
on the capacity and quality of the governance. However, when the
needs of the population are urgent, they often cannot await the devel-
opment of government capacity and institutions, as indicated above;
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 309
this is particularly the case in instances of severe political imperfection,
such as weak governance capacity.
That said, by bypassing the government, the donor community
denies government an opportunity to build its capacity and its legiti-
macy. The increase of the legitimacy and credibility of the government,
as well as the feeling of ownership over the recovery process by local
stakeholders, can also be a way of curbing support for potential insur-
gency and by itself contribute to the peaceful alternative.
According to Myerson (2009, 2011), while recent interventions
have had other priorities when the goal is state-building, the primary
focus of all military and economic operations should be on supporting
broad development of political networks under the leadership of the
state. Hence, the essential measure of success for a reconstruction proj-
ect may be not in how many bridges or schools it repairs, but in how
it enhances the reputations of political leaders who spend the proj-
ect’s funds. Interestingly, related points were made decades ago when
Galula (1964) emphasized, as an essential goal of any stabilization
operation, building a political machine from the population upward; he
also observed that political machines are generally built on patronage.
This perspective suggests that successful S&R will depend on the
new regime developing a political network that distributes power and
patronage throughout the nation (Myerson, 2009).
Myerson argues that to compete for power in any political
system, a leader must build a base of active supporters, and that the
key to motivating this base is the leader’s reputation for distributing
patronage benefits to loyal supporters. The idea is that real political
strength of the regime must be found in the leaders who have stakes in
the regime and in their ability to mobilize active support. When such
leaders are too few or too weak, the regime can be sustained only with
the help of foreign intervention. If there are communities where the
regime lacks any local supporters, then these communities can become
a fertile ground for insurgents to begin building a rival system of power,
with encouragement from disaffected local leaders. If a new regime is
endorsed by an overwhelming majority of local leaders throughout the
nation, then the others will feel compelled to follow suit. Accordingly,
310 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
in this view, foreign aid must be directly channeled toward the creation
and support of patronage benefits to the supporters of local leaders.
If the idea is to build a stable political system, the leaders of the
nation (including the leaders of the insurgency) should thus be recognized
as political forces, and aid should be allocated with respect to an
appropriate balance between national, provincial, and local leaderships.
The improvement of the relationships between national and local power
is vital for the development of the state, and for this, the donors must take
responsibility in influencing the distribution of power across different
levels of government through the balanced allocation of aid.
It is important to note, however, that the resulting network might
not be democratic, which in turn suggests that the results of economic
aid would benefit if accompanied by a constitutional structure broadly
supported by regional powers that are committed to democratic
principles.
As an example of misguided balancing of foreign aid, Myerson
discusses the case of occupied Iraq. He argues that the Coalition
Provisional Authority could have begun in 2003 to cultivate local
democratic leadership by holding local elections throughout Iraq
and then giving the elected leaders responsibility for spending local
reconstruction budgets. Even if much of this money had been wasted
(from a development perspective), the local leaders who spent it well
would have gained good reputations that could have made them serious
contenders for higher office after national sovereignty was restored.
Instead, priority was put on drafting a national constitution before
any introduction of local democracy in occupied Iraq, and while local
leadership was not cultivated, insurgencies took root.
A related matter was discussed earlier in this chapter. Keefer and
Khemani (2005) discussed the ability of the government to make cred-
ible commitments to pursue broader public policies. The credibility of
the government depends on the information of the citizens. The lack of
information about the performance of politicians and the decisions of
the government that have a direct impact on the welfare of the citizens
influences the credibility of the government and thus the peacebuild-
ing process.7 Myerson (2009) specifies that to develop the credibility of
government, transparent accounting for public funds is essential, espe-
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 311
cially to the local population. The local population should be able to
observe how the funds are used by the recipient government and what
the government has accomplished with them. Indeed, donors must
insist on accountability to the local population.
Aid can and should be used to build up the credibility of the
government or its legitimacy. The idea is to give the government an
opportunity to show that it is delivering what it is promising. In this
way, the government can gather the political support from the citizens
and in turn be less vulnerable to insurgency. The government will also
have greater incentives to pursue a policy protecting the broader public
interests. Once the government has acquired initial credibility and
legitimacy through concrete and observable actions and by increasing
spending transparency, it remains for the government to maintain its
credibility and sustain peace with reduced levels of continued interna-
tional assistance.
An important side note here is that the mechanisms for admin-
istering aid can severely undercut the government. As discussed by
Ghani and Lockhart (2008), among others, foreign-assistance organi-
zations can outbid the government in hiring scarce skilled staff, thereby
weakening the government, which desperately needs such expertise.
Azam (1995) describes how redistribution of the resources con-
trolled by the government and military expenditure can be combined
for buying peace. Peace depends entirely, he argues, on the ability of the
government to commit credibly to such redistribution as public expen-
ditures in health and education sectors or giving away some “gifts” to
the opponents. The study illustrates the suggested framework with ref-
erence to various African countries, including post-conflict countries
such as Ethiopia and Uganda in the 1990s. Azam (2001) developed
this idea further and provides a discussion of the various means used
by African governments to gain credibility based on promises made.
He presents a formal game theoretic model to understand the impact
of the ability of the government to commit credibly to its expenditure
policy and of redistribution on rebellious activity. Using the model,
he shows that a credible, strong government will rely more on redis-
tribution than on repressive actions. However, according to this study,
maintaining credibility in the long run requires that the institutional
312 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
framework be more important than the government’s reputation, since
the latter is liable to disappear once the government changes. This has
important implications for aid policy in the case of post-conflict coun-
tries and in particular with respect to the most-appropriate condition-
ality. It suggests that for a peaceful environment, and for maintaining
the government’s credibility in the long run, political conditionality on aid
should focus on institutional solutions and restrictions.
Similarly, Azam (2008) presents a theoretical framework to under-
stand the role of deterrence and redistribution in peacekeeping and
suggests that the government must balance its expenditure between
redistribution and deterrence in order to establish a peaceful equilib-
rium. According to this model, high enough levels of institutional and
military efficiencies are required to make peace credible. In particular,
with respect to the role of foreign aid, the model suggests that the cost
of peace can be reduced and peace can be reached more efficiently by
combining institutional reconstruction with a concomitant effort at
improving the military capabilities of the government to deter rebel-
lion. This study illustrates how the donor community can help the post-
conflict country create a peaceful environment for attracting investors
and, over time, reduce its reliance on international assistance. Specifi-
cally, according to the model, foreign aid must be used to increase the
level of effective deterrence—for example, to increase the profession-
alism of its armed forces as well as to increase the efficiency of public
funds management and all kinds of policies aimed at improving public
service delivery to the population. This approach illustrates ways in
which continued though limited foreign aid might help to prevent con-
flict recurrence while emphasizing again the importance and the role of
the recipient government.
The institutions that implement development aid are still gaining
experience and learning how to operate in countries recovering from
war. For aid to be effective in post-conflict environments, states may
need to adapt and adjust for their specific needs and circumstances
along the lines discussed above. However, it is important to recognize
that, at the moment, most development-aid agencies have limited expe-
rience in post-conflict areas and are not particularly sensitive to the
special circumstances of each post-conflict case. Staff members and
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 313
personnel on location have claimed to have learned tremendously from
their individual experiences, but they struggle in attempting to draw
lessons that are widely applicable (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). Recent
literature suggests that one major, but rarely addressed, challenge is
how to improve the collaboration of development aid with security
and stabilization aid, both within and outside of post-conflict states
(Epstein, 2010).
Conclusions
We began this chapter with a lengthy discussion of dilemmas associ-
ated with foreign aid in post-conflict situations. These relate to conflicts
between (1) short-term versus longer-term objectives; (2) traditional
versus more-specific S&R objectives; (3) strengthening government by
funneling aid through it versus improving the efficiency of aid by direct
delivery to the population; (4) strengthening central government and
improving some kinds of efficiency by working through the govern-
ment, versus emphasizing bottom-up developments at local and prov-
ince levels through the buildup of a decentralized patronage system;
(5) imposing conditionalities to improve national performance, versus
attending quickly to urgent needs.
Table 7.3 summarizes our attempt to reconcile these tensions.
Further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand
the role and the impact of foreign aid in S&R, which conditionalities
are most efficient in post conflict settings, and how they should be
enforced. However, as discussed also in Chapter One, care should be
exercised in drawing policy conclusions from statistical-empirical stud-
ies in this domain. As discussed above, the better literature shows that
results of the existing studies often depend sensitively on such method-
ological details as the assumed form of regression models, the coding
of historical points, aggregation (e.g., length of time periods), and other
matters. Careful studies that include sound empirical approaches and
design have to overcome the inherent “endogeneity problem” 8 and pos-
sible omitted-variables bias. Careful studies will restrict conclusions to
the specific set of countries and cases studied in the analysis, because
314 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
generalizability is limited in a domain with such heterogeneity of cir-
cumstances. Sound empirical analysis also needs to be informed by
understandable theoretical arguments, needs to include alternative per-
spectives, and would benefit from other forms of empirical informa-
tion, such as detailed case studies and even the more anecdotal experi-
ences of practitioners, to begin with. Without an adequate econometric
design and such cross-methodology work and presentation of compet-
ing analyses, efforts to infer causal relationships and suggest strategies
for policymakers should be regarded with suspicion.
Table 7.3
Reconciling Tensions
Tension Resolution
Short term versus long term Base relative emphasis on starting conditions as
suggested in Table 7.2.
Traditional versus S&R-unique
objectives
Improve the collaboration and the integration
of the different development aid agencies.
Working through or around
governments
Base strategy on circumstances, i.e., the
governance quality and the governance
capacity, as suggested in Table 7.2.
Strengthening government
by building up patronage
systems (bottom-up approach)
versus strengthening central
government (top-down
approach)
In whichever approach is taken, build
the credibility and the legitimacy of the
government—e.g., encourage concrete
actions observable by the population, balance
aid between national and local powers,
and promote accountability to the local
population.
Imposing conditionalities or not;
doing so in the interest of speed
Focus conditionalities on matters important to
leaders rather than the population at large—
e.g., exclude conditionality on humanitarian
activities. Include institution-building in the
conditions. Use conditionalities to improve the
credibility of the government by improving
information flows to local populations and
increasing the transparency of government
action.
Dilemmas of Foreign Aid in Post-Conflict Areas 315
Endnotes
1 In Iraq, funding for such physical projects has come from both the Department
of Defense and the Department of State. The Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF)
was used for both short-term stabilization and longer-term development programs
at a rate of roughly $500 million–$1 billion per year.
2 Lancaster (2008) has studied patterns of U.S. bilateral aid in recent years and
concludes that it has sometimes been used as a pure instrument of U.S. foreign
policy—i.e., as an instrument for furthering perceived U.S. interests (hardly surpris-
ing or troubling). There is a good deal of additional literature that attempts to infer
the effective agenda of the donor community and to note incongruities. Svensson
(1999), for example, explains that historically the statistical impact of aid on growth
has depended on the degree of civil and political liberties, but that aid is not allo-
cated accordingly (i.e., to countries where success would be most likely). Chauvet
(2002) looks at the relationship between aid allocation and “sociopolitical instabili-
ties.” Her findings suggest that elite instability (including coup d’etat, revolutions
and major government crises) and violent instability (including political assassina-
tions, guerilla warfare and civil wars) are correlated with increased aid—i.e., that
aid flow is directed at governments that are under political threat. In contrast, social
instability (including strikes, demonstrations and riots) is correlated with reduced
aid, indicating that aid shies away from threats directed instead at the economy.
Alesina and Dollar (2000) explain that political and strategic considerations play a
much more important role than the economic conditions and policy performance
of the recipient countries in the allocation of foreign aid. They conclude that his-
tory (e.g., ties from the colonial period) and strategic alliances are the main statisti-
cal determinants of the amount of aid received by poor countries. Fleck and Kilby
(2006a) show that commercial relationships play an important part in determining
the allocation of U.S. bilateral aid across countries. Fleck and Kilby (2006a, 2006b)
extend their analysis and show that U.S. trading and political interests significantly
influence the aid allocation of the World Bank, but caution that reverse causation
between aid and trade may influence these findings—i.e. rather than trade interests
causing aid, the provision of aid (or expectations of assistance) influences the level of
trade between the recipient and donor country. Dreher, Sturm, and Vreeland (2009)
also show with a panel study of 157 countries over the period 1970–2004 that a two-
year membership in the UN Security Council correlates positively with the number
of World Bank projects a country receives. They find these results to be robust even
after controlling for the economic, political, and regional country characteristics.
3 Statistical tests have been conducted on many other factors that might be thought
to be determinants of foreign-aid allocation. These have included supporting democ-
racy (Svensson, 1999; Alesina and Dollar, 2000), fighting corruption (Alesina and
Weder, 2002), and reducing undesirable immigration (Azam and Berlinschi, 2009).
Arguably, such analysis to understand the de facto motivations of donor countries
in foreign-aid allocation, whether for normal development aid or S&R, is needed to
understanding the potential value of aid under different policies.

5 Some exceptions include the board’s decision to accord aid for Jordan, a critical
country for U.S. interests in the Middle East, which failed many of the performance
indicator tests and was opposed for approval by Freedom House and independent
analysts. Another example is Bolivia, which qualified as eligible by all performance
indicators but was denied eligibility due to deteriorating political relations with the
United States (Tarnoff, 2009).
6 Some have raised concerns about the criteria used in the scoring process, such as
the “ruling justly” category, which is based largely on opinion surveys (Jafari and
Sud, 2004). Others have been concerned about the speed in which MCC operates.
For example, Lancaster (2008) notes that the MCC has been extraordinarily slow in
disbursing the sizable amount of funding appropriated to it, raising questions about
the efficacy of this new model.
7 The inherent asymmetric information is due to the fact that it takes a significant
amount of time to build the infrastructure needed for the provision of services and
for those to have an effect on the citizen’s welfare while in the meantime citizens are
left with no reliable information as to the quality performance of the government.
8 The “problem of endogeneity” arises when the factors that are supposed to affect
a particular outcome depend themselves on that outcome.

Paul K. Davis
The starting point for any student of stabilization and reconstruction
(S&R) should be humility, since history tells us that many civil wars
have come to a halt only to be reignited later (not necessarily with the
same actors). Avoiding the resumption of hostilities is a considerable
challenge; maintaining peace and achieving a good measure of nation-
building is all the more so. That said, the challenge is by no means
hopeless, and degrees of success have been achieved historically. This
short, concluding chapter comments briefly on some of the contribu-
tions that we sought to make in the study, some higher-level cross-
cutting conclusions, some conclusions about analytic methods, and
suggestions for future research and analysis. The monograph’s execu-
tive summary is a more comprehensive review of the whole document.
What We Have Tried to Do
Our study was a step toward using the social-science base to work
toward a humble system theory for S&R: a theory intended to assist
understanding, diagnosis, discussion, and strategy-setting under
uncertainty. Accurate, precise, and reliable predictions are not in the
cards for most S&R situations, but informed and structured reasoning
can be.
As discussed in Chapter One, at the top level of our description
we identify security, political, social, and economic components. We
discussed each of these separately, which is certainly feasible and fruit-
ful, but we also consistently discussed their interactions, including the
322 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
idea that the failure of any of these components can doom S&R as a
whole. Analytically, this approach was different from treating factors as
though they were independent (as, e.g., in linear modeling) and from
versions of systems modeling in which such interactions as feedback
loops are so heavily emphasized as to depict everything as constantly
connected to everything else, with the result being difficult to com-
prehend and discuss.1 We have instead summarized social-science con-
structs using a combination of both static “snapshots” in the form of
factor trees and other influence diagrams depicting dynamic interac-
tions over time.
A theme of our study turned out to be the ubiquitous presence
of both uncertainties and dilemmas—some of them real and some of
them merely apparent. We sought, with varying success, to suggest
how the dilemmas can either be resolved (e.g., with more discriminat-
ing situational assessment and recognition of different time scales) or
at least be better understood and discussed when developing strategy.
Another unsettling aspect of S&R is that the challenge often
involves what theorists call “wicked problems” 2 For these, the problem
itself is not tightly defined, and, thus, there is no straightforward solu-
tion to be found by logic alone. The process of addressing the issues with
the multiple stakeholders may allow a solution to “emerge” in that, at
some point, stakeholders may find themselves adequately satisfied with
a set of arrangements. However, those arrangements may not have been
preordained but rather the result of events, personalities, compromises,
and opportunities along the way. Students of political and social his-
tory will not find this surprising, but it has deep implications for strat-
egy and supporting analysis, as discussed below.
In confronting the dilemmas, we addressed a number of sensi-
tive issues candidly, such as issues relating to the potentially contra-
dictory influences of increased security efforts (Chapter Two); regime
type, partitioning, and centralization (Chapters Three and Four); and
“political” considerations in S&R economics (Chapters Six and Seven).
Rather than attempting to identify the “best” among contending
“mini-theories,” we have sought unifying depictions within which the
different mini-theories can be seen as playing roles.
Final Observations 323
While conveying the literature’s emphasis on context dependence,
we attempted to give that concept more concrete meaning by identify-
ing different “cases.” In some instances (as in the economics chapters),
this helped to resolve what may seem to be dilemmas but are better
described as tensions to be dealt with by mixed strategies recognizing
multiple simultaneous objectives. In some cases, the tension can be
resolved by accepting an uncomfortable reality, such as that postwar
economics is fundamentally different from normal development eco-
nomics and is appropriately tied closely to politics.3
Another unusual facet of our study was devoting an entire chapter
to the social component of S&R (Chapter Five), a subject often given
short shrift because the issues are inherently “soft and squishy” and not
amenable to technical solutions. We focused on the trust-and-coop-
eration aspects of S&R because those appear to be critical to its suc-
cess. Fortunately, much is known about how to foster at least modest
degrees of trust and cooperation.
As discussed below, our study had a number of broad observa-
tions mirroring those of an earlier RAND study (Dobbins et al., 2007)
and more-specific conclusions related to strategy formulation, decision
support, and analytic methods.
Broad Observations
The social science on which we drew is not yet mature. From a histori-
cal perspective, it is in some ways still in its infancy. No one should
expect to find clear-cut laws and formulas, whether for forecasting,
diagnosing situations, or prescribing details of strategy. Nonetheless,
there are some broad observations.
First, failures in S&R are most commonly associated with
resource-objective mismatches: Intervenors may set objectives that
exceed the resources they are willing to allocate and sustain. Objec-
tives, then, should be set realistically. One appropriately restrained sug-
gestion on this matter is as follows:
324 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
The objective of S&R should be to leave behind a society likely to
remain at peace with itself and its neighbors once external secu-
rity forces are removed and full sovereignty is restored . . . and
to expect that the nation will do at least as well as others “in the
neighborhood.”*
Second, foreign forces can help stabilize a situation but can also
become destabilizing as resentment to their presence grows. The iden-
tity and character of the forces matters greatly. There is good evidence
that, despite unevenness in quality, UN efforts have had the best
combination of low cost, success rate, and internal legitimacy (Doyle
and Sambanis, 2006). They are not, of course, suitable for large-scale
efforts, much less for invasions to achieve regime change.
Third, success is very difficult if neighboring states are committed
to frustrating the S&R effort. Thus, such states must be engaged diplo-
matically, hopefully to become part of the solution.
Fourth, “seizing the moment” early is often important: Steps
taken early in S&R operations can not only be effective in initial sta-
bilization, but also set patterns and attitudes affecting subsequent pos-
sibilities (Dobbins et al., 2007).
As another broad observation, it is commonly asserted that S&R
activities should be increasingly taken over by civilian agencies and
operations. However, when a long view is taken historically, military
forces have usually done the lion’s share of work in past activities of this
nature. It is important to distinguish between having civilian expertise
and guidance in political, social, and economic domains and having
the manpower to accomplish the related tasks. Military forces can and
have provided much of the manpower. Further, if the environment
remains dangerous, the bulk of activities may need to be conducted by
military forces (Moore, 2010).

academic experts, September 2008.
Final Observations 325
Strategies and Decision Support for Strategy-Making
A recurrent theme in our study was recognizing that, because of uncer-
tainties, dilemmas, and wicked problems, S&R strategies often need to
be tentative, well hedged, and adaptive. Such characteristics are argu-
ably features of good strategy generally, but they are especially impor-
tant in S&R. This said, adaptations are often difficult to make unless
the need to do so has been anticipated and preparations laid, and unless
higher authorities (and even the public) understand the philosophy of
“experimenting” with approaches, monitoring progress, and shifting
course as necessary. Although not much discussed in our monograph,
a good deal is known from the planning literature about how to pre-
pare for adaptiveness. This includes, during strategy formulation and
implementation,
• applying the methods of uncertainty-sensitivity planning, which
includes planning “branches and sequels” and also providing
capabilities to permit at-the-time adaptation in response to shocks
(Davis, 2002, 2003a, 2003b).
• identifying critical assumptions that underlie the strategy but
may prove to be invalid (Dewar, 2003).
• identifying “signposts” of failure of those assumptions, so that the
need for adaptations can be flagged when they appear.
• implementing associated monitoring, with related data collection
and analysis, even if there is resistance to doing so (as there may
be for fear that some of the inevitable failures will be criticized).
• defining metrics and analysis methods that reflect a system view
(Davis et al., 2010) and dynamics, such as lag times, so as not
to misdiagnose developments. At least rudimentary dynamic
models are needed, as has long been taught in business planning
(Sterman, 2000) and practiced in capabilities-based planning
(Davis et al., 2010).
All of this also has implications for decision support and related
analysis. Such analysis should, for example, (1) develop options that
hedge in various ways, (2) show option assessments against multiple
326 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
criteria so that tensions and dilemmas are visible, (3) include as criteria
risks and the feasibility of subsequent adaptations, and (4) promote
and facilitate hedging and anticipation of possible adaptation. This
approach is very different from, e.g., seeking to inform the decision-
maker as to what option is “optimal” by a dominant criterion and a set
of best-estimate assumptions.
Analytic Methods
Although fragmented, the theoretical literature suggests numerous
“risk factors,” influences, and structures for thinking seriously about
S&R. We have sought to reflect those in the current study.* Although
the empirical literature has not converged in assessing the diverse
hypotheses, the competing studies and debates have greatly sharpened
the issues, as when noting that a previously identified risk factor was
too aggregated and failed to distinguish between importantly different
kinds of situations. The “risk-factor” nature of much empirical work
also provides important cautionaries for planners (e.g., the often-cited
observation that success in stabilization has usually required large
numbers of “boots on the ground” and that success is strongly associ-
ated with a population-centric approach).
Some critical observations about analytic methods are appropri-
ate, especially because misunderstandings exist about what should be
expected from social-science research and what constitutes more and
less “rigorous” evidence. The term evidence based research, which has
recently been advocated for S&R related issues, has a connotation asso-
ciated with statistical analysis of controlled trials, as in large-scale tests
* Although the literature we reviewed largely emphasizes risk factors, recent work by the State
Department’s Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) has
importantly emphasized looking for resiliency factors and processes. We strongly endorse
that view, which is well supported by segments of the social-science literature. See the Inter-
agency Conflict Assessment Framework (ICAF) framework (United States Institute of Peace
and United States Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute, 2009) and the
State Department’s list of web links to relevant current reports (Department of State, no
date).

of medicines. That type of evidence, however, has little to do with evi-
dence to inform S&R strategy and policy.4
Empirical evidence comes in many forms, including anecdotal
accounts, somewhat more structured testimony of practitioners, case
histories, and quantitative data analysis. It is sometimes assumed that
the latter is more “rigorous” and “scientific,” but the reality for S&R
is different. As discussed in earlier chapters, very few findings have
held up well across studies. This is due largely to fundamental prob-
lems in data. Researchers have depended on historical data from civil
wars. Problems have also arisen from overly simple models (e.g., linear
models rather than system models), over-aggregation, failures to test
routinely for robustness, and shortcomings of the data itself. The data
are not in any sense the result of controlled experiments, but rather usu-
ally the result of pooling data from the diverse wars that have occurred
(mostly in the last half of the 20th century); there is no particular
reason to believe that the aggregate statistics from such heterogeneous
cases inform us about what will happen in the next case—especially
given the repeated insistence by researchers doing in-depth work that
context-specific factors and events have been crucial in individual cases.
Excellent and constructive critiques have arisen within the social-
science community itself (Sambanis, 2004; Kalyvas, Shapiro, and
Masoud, 2008). Kalvyas, Shapiro, and Masoud state:
the problems of econometric studies are well known: their main
findings are incredibly sensitive to coding and measurement pro-
cedures (Hegre and Sambanis, 2006…); they entail a consider-
able distance between theoretical constructs and proxies . . . as
well as multiple observationally equivalent pathways; they suffer
from endogeneity . . . ; they lack clear microfoundations or are
based on erroneous ones . . . ; and, finally, they are subject to
narrow (and untheorized) scope conditions.
The Sambanis study cited above is a convincing, in-depth but
accessible discussion of both the problems and ways to address them,
one urging research that draws heavily on case-study research to sup-
plement the more usual aggregate-level historical data.
328 Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction
Sambanis (2004), Kalyvas, Shapiro, and Masoud (2008), and
others recommend more “micro” studies in which individual countries
are studied at higher resolution, perhaps distinguishing among mul-
tiple phases and areas of conflict and accounting for special influences
known to be important in the cases studied. As an example of what
this entails, a recent paper examines empirical evidence on the second
Chechen war, drawing conclusions about the relative effectiveness of
Russian-only and Russian-Chechen operations in counterinsurgency
(Lyall, 2010).
Another very positive development, one illustrating how science
proceeds with competitive studies, debate, and responses, is that recent
quantitative research on civil wars has included more robustness analy-
sis (Collier, Hoeffler, and Rohner, 2009; Goldstone et al., 2010). Per-
haps that will become routine as the field develops.
Although we did not discuss the subject except in passing in the
current study, another fruitful area of analytic modeling needs to be
mentioned: forecasting models that combine aspects of agent-based
rational-choice decisionmaking. In circumstances in which a number
of political factions are competing for influence, the factions change
their positions along various dimensions as they seek allies to improve
their relative power. A substantial amount of research has gone into
studying the related dynamics, which have been shown to have con-
siderable predictive power. They can be employed with “moderate”
data requirements (a good deal of expert judgment).* Further, substan-
tial advances have been made in very recent times, including work by
RAND colleague Ben Wise (unpublished) that extends the range of
circumstances for which the models can be used.
* The seminal work in this field was done by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita (see Bueno de Mes-
quita 1981, 2009). Variants of the approach are embedded in related models, such as the
Sentia Group’s Senturion (see Abdollahian et al., 2006). See Larson et al., 2009, for discus-
sion of the class of such models.
Final Observations 329
Future Research
A great deal of additional research is needed on S&R, at all levels of
detail. As suggested by the above discussion, however, we see special
value in case histories and “micro dynamics” analysis that draws on
contextually rich information as well as the methods of econometrics.
We also urge an increased emphasis on theory-informed analysis in
which, e.g., known interactions are built in from the beginning (as
suggested in Chapter One) rather than added piecemeal and grudg-
ingly, as is common in statistical analysis dominated by data-driven
philosophies.
Especially important, we see the need to develop new methods
of analysis and strategic decision support for S&R, methods aligned
with the concepts of multiple objectives, tensions, dilemmas, hedging,
and adaptations. To be most useful, these should depend on simple
models and data that can actually be obtained or estimated. As dis-
cussed in Chapter Two, subjectively based estimates are appropriate
in some cases, but they need to be elicited within a sound structure so
that experts understand the implications of questions and are assisted
in making distinctions known to be important.
Finally, we believe that a fresh approach is needed in defining S&R
measures and approximate metrics,5 one that (1) reflects the results of
this study and future research that also takes a causal system-model
perspective rather than a correlational perspective and (2) incorporates
both static and dynamic views of the S&R process. Such work should
be approached from a whole-of-government perspective and, indeed,
should be approached with the assumption that multiple governments
are involved. Use of metrics has a long history, much of it dismal
because of organizations having used metrics that lacked grounding
in sound theory and that led, as a result, to misleading assessments
and counterproductive incentives. Something much better is needed
for S&R because the stakes are high.

Endnotes
1 One can be a strong supporter of basic precepts in System Dynamics, as promul-
gated a half-century ago by the Massachusettes Institute of Technology’s Jay For-
rester (1961) and described in a more recent textbook by John Sterman (2000), while
also recognizing that complex systems are usually “nearly decomposable” in the
sense discussed by Herbert Simon (1981): The components of such systems can be
distinguished and studied more or less separately to great benefit, but a full under-
standing of the system requires treating the interactions as well. These, however,
may be separable by recognizing, e.g., that some interactions are weak, that some
operate over longer time scales, and that still others can be described in low-resolu-
tion terms. Recognizing that is also important in multiresolution modeling, which
has myriad benefits for analysis (Davis, 2003b; Davis and Bigelow, 2003) and stra-
tegic planning (Davis, 2002).
2 See also a recent paper (Menkhaus, 2010); a somewhat older paper by Horst
Rittel, who introduced the concept (Rittel and Noble, 1988); and Roberts (2009).
3 See especially Chapter Five and the work of Roger Myerson (2008).
4 Such matters were discussed at USAID’s “Evidence Summit,” September 7–9,
2010.
5 Substantial interagency work has already been accomplished on S&R-related
metrics, much of which appears to be quite useful (Agoglia, Dziedzic, and Sotirin,
2010). However, the approach we suggest would be different in important respects.
