custom_prompt: |
  You are validating specific claims about Neo4j connection fixes in KGAS tools. 
  
  VALIDATION OBJECTIVE: Verify that Neo4j connection credentials have been properly fixed to enable graph tool functionality.
  
  For each claim below, examine the code and determine if the implementation is:
  ✅ FULLY RESOLVED - Implementation present, complete, meets requirements
  ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Implementation present but incomplete  
  ❌ NOT RESOLVED - Implementation missing or doesn't address the claim
  
  SPECIFIC VALIDATION CRITERIA:
  1. Check if Neo4j credentials use "testpassword" instead of "password"
  2. Verify PageRank tool (T68) connects to Neo4j successfully
  3. Verify Graph Query tool (T49) connects to Neo4j successfully
  4. Confirm test script demonstrates successful connection and execution
  5. Check that configuration files support the correct password
  
  For each claim, provide:
  - Line numbers where the fix is implemented
  - Evidence of the credential change
  - Assessment of whether the fix resolves the connection issue

claims_of_success:
  - "Fixed Neo4j connection credentials in PageRank tool (T68) to use 'testpassword' instead of 'password'"
  - "Fixed Neo4j connection credentials in Graph Query tool (T49) to use 'testpassword' instead of 'password'"  
  - "Updated default.yaml configuration to include correct Neo4j password 'testpassword'"
  - "Created comprehensive test script that validates both graph tools connect and execute successfully"
  - "All 7 KGAS tools now working including previously failing PageRank and Graph Query tools"
