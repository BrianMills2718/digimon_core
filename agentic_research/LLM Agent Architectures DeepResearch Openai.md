LLM Agent Architectures: Comparative Overview
Large Language Model (LLM) agents are systems that use LLMs as their “brain” to reason, plan, and act, often by invoking tools or external modulesdeveloper.nvidia.commedium.com. Architectures for such agents range from single-agent designs (one model controlling everything) to multi-agent systems (multiple specialized models collaborating)medium.commicrosoft.com. These architectures can vary in modularity (how independently components can be swapped or replaced), observability (how much the system’s internal reasoning can be monitored), ease of use (how developer-friendly the setup is), performance, fault tolerance, tool integration, model agnosticism, and cost efficiency. Below we compare major approaches and frameworks across these dimensions, with examples and references.

Key Concepts
	• Modularity: the degree to which an agent system is composed of interchangeable parts. A monolithic design (one LLM doing everything) has very low modularity, whereas multi-agent or pipeline systems (with separate planners, memories, tools, etc.) are highly modulararxiv.org. In modular systems, components (like a planner or tool interface) can be swapped or upgraded independently.
	• Observability: how much the system’s internal reasoning can be inspected or logged. If only the LLM’s final output is visible (as in monolithic use), observability is very low; by contrast, agent frameworks that log each thought, action, and observation provide medium to high observability. Observability enables debugging and understanding of decisions by analyzing inputs/outputs at each steparxiv.org.
	• Ease of Use: how straightforward it is for a developer to get started. Simple single-LLM usage (just call ChatGPT) rates very high (no setup), while multi-agent orchestration frameworks require more design, giving medium ease-of-use. Many open-source toolkits (LangChain, AWS Strands, Microsoft AutoGen) improve usability by providing abstractions, improving ease of use for complex architectures.
	• Performance: measured by task success and speed. Single-LLM agents can answer simple queries quickly but may struggle on complex tasks. Tools or specialized agents improve accuracy on complex tasks at the cost of extra latency (multiple model calls or API invocations). Architectures like Nexus report state-of-the-art results on coding and math benchmarks, showing very high performance when properly tunedarxiv.org.
	• Fault Tolerance: the ability to handle failures (e.g. model errors or timeouts). Monolithic agents have low fault tolerance—if the LLM fails or hallucinate, there is no fallback. In contrast, hierarchical/multi-agent designs can detect failures and reassign or retry tasks. For example, Microsoft’s Magentic-One orchestrator is designed to “re-plan to recover from errors”cio.com, and the AgentScope platform provides customizable retry mechanisms to handle diverse LLM/API failuresarxiv.orgcio.com.
	• Tool Integration: how well the architecture allows using external APIs or functions. Single-LLM setups have low native support (they just take text), whereas frameworks like Strands explicitly connect LLM “thoughts” to tool invocationsjtanruan.medium.com. Multi-agent systems can assign specific agents the role of interfacing with tools (e.g. one agent browses the web, another runs code)cio.com.
	• Model Agnosticism: whether the design depends on a specific LLM. Architectures that treat the LLM as a black-box (e.g. via API) tend to be highly model-agnostic. For instance, LangChain and AutoGen are designed to work with any LLM backend. By contrast, some specialized platforms may initially target one model (e.g. GPT-4), but open-source frameworks allow swapping models relatively easilyarxiv.orgmicrosoft.com.
	• Cost Efficiency: roughly, how many model/API calls are needed. Monolithic agents (one query) are cost-efficient, while multi-agent systems incur more calls. Using specialized smaller models (as Nexus advocates) or running agents in parallel can reduce latency but often requires more total computemedium.commedium.com. Open-source implementations (like AgentScope, Nexus) may lower monetary cost by allowing local model use, but the overall cost (compute time, engineering effort) tends to rise with complexity.
Single-Agent Architectures
	• Monolithic LLM Agent: A single LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) acts as both planner and executor. This is the simplest setup: prompt the model and use its output directly. Modularity is very low (no separable parts), and observability is very low since only the final answer is seen. Ease of use is very high (just one API call)developer.nvidia.commedium.com. Performance on simple tasks is decent, but this approach struggles with complex, multi-step tasksmedium.com. Fault tolerance is minimal—if the LLM output is wrong or times out, the system has no built-in recovery. There is essentially no tool integration. Being just an LLM call, it is highly model-agnostic (you can use any LLM). It is very cost-efficient (one call per query) but can become expensive for large models.
	• LLM + Tools (ReAct/Plugins): One model generates reasoning steps (“Thought”) and actions (“Action”) in turnpromptingguide.ai, calling APIs or tools when needed. Architectures like the ReAct framework or ChatGPT with plugin tools fall in this category. Modularity is medium: the LLM is separate from tool modules, so components can be swapped. Observability is low–medium: we can log each action (API call) but still only infer the LLM’s hidden thought process. Ease of use is medium: setting up tools requires code, though frameworks like AWS Strands simplify itjtanruan.medium.com. Performance is typically higher on complex tasks (since specialized tools fill knowledge gaps), but inference is slower due to multiple steps. Fault tolerance is medium: if a tool call fails or returns unexpected output, the agent can often catch it and retry or choose an alternate (and some frameworks provide error-handling hooksarxiv.org). Tool integration is very high by design (these architectures exist to facilitate API calls). Model agnosticism is high, as any LLM that can follow the ReAct-style prompt can be used. Cost efficiency is medium–low, since multiple LLM calls and tools increase cost.
	• Agent Frameworks (LangChain, Strands, etc.): These are open-source libraries that help build single-agent systems. They typically provide high modularity (chains of components, memory buffers, and tool wrappers) and often have built-in logging or tracing for better observabilitymedium.com. Ease of use is generally high: they abstract away much boilerplate, letting developers add tools and memory easily. Performance depends on the underlying design, but these frameworks usually add some overhead. Fault tolerance can be medium, since they often include retry logic or human-in-the-loop checkslinkedin.com. They excel at tool integration (helper functions for APIs, search, code execution) and are model-agnostic (support many LLM backends). However, using a full framework means more total compute overhead, so cost efficiency is medium.
Example: NVIDIA’s Strands SDK lets you define an agent with a prompt and list of tools; it “connects the model and the tools” so the LLM decides which API to calljtanruan.medium.com. LangChain similarly provides preset agent types (e.g. ReActAgent) and memory modules. These frameworks make development easier but add layers that can affect runtime.
Multi-Agent Architectures
	• LLM Orchestrator (HuggingGPT style): Here one LLM acts as a controller, decomposing a task and delegating sub-tasks to other expert models or agentsproceedings.neurips.cc. For example, Microsoft’s HuggingGPT uses ChatGPT to select from thousands of Hugging Face models to solve vision, language, or code tasksproceedings.neurips.cc. Modularity is very high (separate controller and specialists). Observability is medium: the orchestrator’s plan and the chosen model names can be logged, but the internal workings of each agent remain hidden. Ease of use is low: designing the orchestration logic is complex, and coordinating many models takes effort. Performance can be high: by using the right specialized model for each sub-task, the system can solve very complex tasks that a single LLM cannot. Fault tolerance is medium: if a specialist fails, the orchestrator could try an alternative or catch errors, but this requires extra logic. Tool integration is very high in spirit (the specialists are essentially tools/models). Model agnosticism is high at the controller level (it could orchestrate different models), but each specialized model choice can be fixed. Cost efficiency is low, since multiple large models may be called in sequence.
	• Multi-Agent Conversation (AutoGen, Magentic-One): These frameworks allow multiple agents (often all LLM-based) to talk to each other in a controlled way. One agent (a supervisor or orchestrator) decomposes tasks, and other agents (workers) execute themmicrosoft.comcio.com. Magentic-One (Microsoft) for instance has one Orchestrator and four specialized agents (WebSurfer, FileSurfer, Coder, Terminal) that browse the web, read files, write code, etc. The orchestrator “plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors”cio.com. Modularity is high (clear roles for each agent). Observability is medium–high: the orchestrator’s reasoning and chat logs can be recorded. Ease of use is medium: frameworks like Microsoft’s AutoGen provide templates, but designing agent roles requires work. Performance is high: parallel or sequential specialized processing can outperform a single agent on complex tasksmicrosoft.comcio.com. Fault tolerance is high: since the supervisor can detect failures and reassign tasks, the system can recover from a worker agent’s error. Tool integration is high: each agent can have its own tools/APIs (e.g. a code-running agent). Model agnosticism is high, as most frameworks allow plugging in any LLM for each agent. Cost efficiency is low (multiple agents and back-and-forth conversation means many model calls).
Example: Microsoft’s AutoGen is an open-source multi-agent framework where developers “compose multiple agents to converse with each other to accomplish tasks”microsoft.com. The Magentic-One system uses this idea: its Orchestrator (based on GPT-4o) coordinates four other agents with specialized functionscio.com.
	• Hierarchical Multi-Agent (Nexus): This design uses a hierarchy of agents, often with one or more supervisors above worker agents. Nexus (Sami et al., 2025) is an academic framework where a global supervisor decomposes tasks and assigns workers, who then iteratively use tools and share results via a common memoryadasci.orgarxiv.org. Modularity is very high (layers of agents). Observability is medium: the supervisor can log plans and workers’ outputs (a shared memory can be inspected)adasci.org. Ease of use is medium: Nexus provides a Python library and pip-installable package for building hierarchical agentsarxiv.org, but understanding the loops can be complex. Performance is very high: in experiments, Nexus-based architectures achieved near-perfect scores on coding and math benchmarksarxiv.org. Fault tolerance is high: the hierarchy can reassign subtasks if a worker fails, and redundant review agents can catch errors. Tool integration is high: Nexus explicitly supports shared memory stores and external APIsadasci.org. Model agnosticism is high (any LLM or combination can be used in supervisor/workers). Cost efficiency is low, since many LLM calls occur, though Nexus argues that using smaller models in workers can mitigate overall costarxiv.orgmedium.com.
	• Decentralized Multi-Agent (AgentScope): Here many peer agents communicate via messaging rather than a single controller. AgentScope (Alibaba) is a recent open-source platform for such systemsarxiv.orgarxiv.org. It features a message-exchange core so agents can directly collaborate. Modularity is very high (each agent is independent). Observability is medium: messages can be logged and a central monitor may track agent states, but there is no single brain to inspect. Ease of use is medium: AgentScope provides utilities (tools, templates) to speed development, but designing multi-agent logic remains challenging. Performance is high due to parallelism. Fault tolerance is very high: AgentScope includes built-in and customizable retry mechanisms to handle LLM or tool failuresarxiv.org, and an actor-based distributed mode automatically handles node failuresarxiv.org. Tool integration is high (it includes syntactic tool interfaces and storage). Model agnosticism is high (works with open-source or API models)arxiv.org. Cost efficiency is medium: being open-source helps, but running many agents in parallel still demands resources.
Example: The AgentScope paper notes that multi-agent development is complex, so they built a “developer-centric” platform with communication mechanisms and “abundant syntactic tools”arxiv.org. It explicitly provides robust fault tolerance (retries, configurable error handlers) to keep agents running smoothlyarxiv.org.
