please perform a critical comprehensive extensive detailed methodical review of my codebase starting with the documentation. There should be two main documents sets. an architecture set which has an architecture_overview.md of everything related to the final goal which links to more detailed descriptions in indiivudal files for each concept. these files should not change during dvelopopment unless the final goal changes or is clarified. then we would have roadmap documentation that outlines the development plan to get to the final architecture. this would include a roadamp_overview.md which an overview of all the phases and tasks in the roadmap and which points to more detailed files for those phases and tasks. the roadmap overview is the only place in the documentation that status updates are recorded. so the architecture is the sole source of truth for the final product. and the roadmap overview is the sole source of truth for the current status. The documentation should not have timeline details.
