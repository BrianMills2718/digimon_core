Set up and run a Gemini validation to verify my implementation claims. Follow this precise methodology:

## STEP 1: PREPARE VALIDATION
1. **Clear cache first**: `python gemini-review-tool/gemini_review.py --clear-cache`
2. **Create focused config**: Use timestamp-based filename like `validation-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS].yaml`
3. **Include only relevant files**: Be surgical - only files containing the claimed implementations

## STEP 2: CONFIGURE VALIDATION 
Set up config with:
- **project_name**: Specific validation objective (e.g., "Missing Methods Implementation Validation")
- **include_patterns**: Only files with claimed implementations (no Evidence.md, logs, or unrelated code)
- **custom_prompt**: Clear validation objective with specific criteria for each claim
- **claims_of_success**: Each claim mapped to specific file location and expected behavior

## STEP 3: VALIDATION CRITERIA
For each claim, verify:
- **Implementation Present**: Does the method/feature exist where claimed?
- **Functionality Complete**: Is it fully implemented (not stub/placeholder)?
- **Requirements Met**: Does it satisfy specific requirements mentioned?

## STEP 4: EXECUTE VALIDATION
Run: `python gemini-review-tool/gemini_review.py --config [config-file] --no-cache`

## STEP 5: REPORT VERDICT
For each claim, report Gemini's verdict:
- ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED** - Implementation present, complete, meets requirements
- ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - Implementation present but incomplete or doesn't fully meet requirements  
- ❌ **NOT RESOLVED** - Implementation missing or doesn't address the claimed issue

**SUCCESS INDICATORS**: Gemini references specific line numbers, addresses each claim individually, mentions only included files
**FAILURE INDICATORS**: Gemini analyzes different issues, generic analysis, mentions excluded files
