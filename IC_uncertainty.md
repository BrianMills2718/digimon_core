Analytic Standards
A. AUTHORITY: The National Security Act of 1947, as amended; the
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004; Executive
Order 12333, as amended; Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-28; and
other applicable provisions of law.
B. PURPOSE
1. This Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) establishes the
Intelligence Community (IC) Analytic Standards that govern the
production and evaluation of analytic products; articulates the
responsibility of intelligence analysts to strive for excellence, integrity,
and rigor in their analytic thinking and work practices; and delineates the
role of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Analytic
Ombuds.
2. This Directive supersedes ICD 203, Analytic Standards, dated 21
June 2007, and rescinds ICPM 2006-200-2, Role of the Qffice of the
Director of National Intelligence Analytic Ombudsman.
C. APPLICABILITY
1. This ICD applies to the IC, as defined by the National Security Act
of 194 7, as amended; and to such elements of any other department or
agency as may be designated an element of the IC by the President, or
jointly by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the head of the
department or agency concerned.
2. This Directive does not apply to purely law enforcement
information. When law enforcement information also contains
intelligence or intelligence-related information, this Directive shall apply
only to the intelligence or intelligence-related information and analysis
contained therein.
D. POLICY
1. The IC Analytic Standards are the core principles of intelligence
analysis and are to be applied across the IC. IC Analytic Standards shall
be applied in each analytic product in a manner appropriate to its purpose,
the type and scope of its underlying source information, its production
timeline, and its customers. IC elements may create supplemental analytic
standards that are tailored to their particular missions.
2. The IC Analytic Standards are the foundational assessment criteria
for a regular program of review of IC analytic products. Each IC element
shall maintain a program of product evaluation using the IC Analytic
Standards as the core elements for assessment criteria.
3
ICD 203
3. The IC Analytic Standards serve as a common IC foundation for developing education
and training in analytic skills. The results of analytic product evaluations will be used to
improve materials and programs for education and training in analytic knowledge, skills,
abilities, and tradecraft.
4. The Standards also promote a common ethic for achieving analytic rigor and excellence,
and for personal integrity in analytic practice. Adherence to IC Analytic Standards is
safeguarded by the ODNI Analytic Ombuds, who addresses concerns regarding lack of
objectivity, bias, politicization, or other issues in Standards application in analytic products.
5. The Standards promote the protection of privacy and civil liberties by ensuring the
objectivity, timeliness, relevance, and accuracy of personally identifiable information (PII) used
in analytic products. Analysts should include PII in products only as it relates to a specific
analytic purpose (e.g., necessary to understand the foreign intelligence or counterintelligence
information or assess its importance), consistent with IC element mission and in compliance with
IC element regulation and policy, including procedures to prevent, identify, and correct errors in
PII.
6. The IC Analytic Standards guide analysis and analytic production. All IC analytic
products shall be consistent with the following five Analytic Standards, including the nine
Analytic Tradecraft Standards.
a. Objective: Analysts must perform their functions with objectivity and with
awareness of their own assumptions and reasoning. They must employ reasoning techniques and
practical mechanisms that reveal and mitigate bias. Analysts should be alert to influence by
existing analytic positions or judgments and must consider alternative perspectives and contrary
information. Analysis should not be unduly constrained by previous judgments when new
developments indicate a modification is necessary.
b. Independent of political consideration: Analytic assessments must not be distorted
by, nor shaped for, advocacy of a particular audience, agenda, or policy viewpoint. Analytic
judgments must not be influenced by the force of preference for a particular policy.
c. Timely: Analysis must be disseminated in time for it to be actionable by customers.
Analytic elements have the responsibility to be continually aware of events of intelligence
interest, of customer activities and schedules, and of intelligence requirements and priorities, in
order to provide useful analysis at the right time.
d. Based on all available sources of intelligence information: Analysis should be
informed by all relevant information available. Analytic elements should identify and address
critical information gaps and work with collection activities and data providers to develop access
and collection strategies.
e. Implements and exhibits Analytic Tradecraft Standards, specifically:
(1) Properly describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and
methodologies: Analytic products should identify underlying sources and methodologies upon
whichjudgments are based, and use source descriptors in accordance with ICD 206, Sourcing
Requirements for Disseminated Analytic Products, to describe factors affecting source quality
and credibility. Such factors can include accuracy and completeness, possible denial and
deception, age and continued currency of information, and technical elements of collection as
4
ICD 203
well as source access, validation, motivation, possible bias, or expertise. Source summary
statements, described in ICD 206, are strongly encouraged and should be used to provide a
holistic assessment of the strengths or weaknesses in the source base and explain which sources
are most important to key analytic judgments.
(2) Properly expresses and explains uncertainties associated with major analytic
judgments: Analytic products should indicate and explain the basis for the uncertainties
associated with major analytic judgments, specifically the likelihood of occurrence of an event or
development, and the analyst's confidence in the basis for this judgment. Degrees of likelihood
encompass a full spectrum from remote to nearly certain. Analysts' confidence in an assessment
or judgment may be based on the logic and evidentiary base that underpin it, including the
quantity and quality of source material, and their understanding of the topic. Analytic products
should note causes of uncertainty (e.g., type, currency, and amount of information, knowledge
gaps, and the nature of the issue) and explain how uncertainties affect analysis (e.g., to what
degree and how a judgment depends on assumptions). As appropriate, products should identify
indicators that would alter the levels of uncertainty for major analytic judgments. Consistency in
the terms used and the supporting information and logic advanced is critical to success in
expressing uncertainty, regardless of whether likelihood or confidence expressions are used.
(a) For expressions oflikelihood or probability, an analytic product must use one
of the following sets of terms:
almost no very unlikely roughly likely very almost
chance unlikely even chance likely certain(ly)
remote highly improbable roughly probable highly nearly certain
improbable (improbably) even odds (probably) probable
01-05% 05-20% 20-45% 45-55% 55-80% 80-95% 95-99%
Analysts are strongly encouraged not to mix terms from different rows. Products that do mix
terms must include a disclaimer clearly noting the terms indicate the same assessment of
probability.
(b) To avoid confusion, products that express an analyst's confidence in an
assessment or judgment using a "confidence level" (e.g., "high confidence") must not combine a
confidence level and a degree of likelihood, which refers to an event or development, in the same
sentence.
(3) Properly distinguishes between underlying intelligence information and analysts'
assumptions and judgments: Analytic products should clearly distinguish statements that convey
underlying intelligence information used in analysis from statements that convey assumptions or
judgments. Assumptions are defined as suppositions used to frame or support an argument;
assumptions affect analytic interpretation of underlying intelligence information. Judgments are
defined as conclusions based on underlying intelligence information, analysis, and assumptions.
Products should state assumptions explicitly when they serve as the linchpin of an argument or
when they bridge key information gaps. Products should explain the implications for judgments
if assumptions prove to be incorrect. Products also should, as appropriate, identify indicators
that, if detected, would alter judgments.
5
ICD 203
(4) Incorporates analysis of alternatives: Analysis of alternatives is the systematic
evaluation of differing hypotheses to explain events or phenomena, explore near-term outcomes,
and imagine possible futures to mitigate surprise and risk. Analytic products should identify and
assess plausible alternative hypotheses. This is particularly important when major judgments
must contend with significant uncertainties, or complexity (e.g., forecasting future trends), or
when low probability events could produce high-impact results. In discussing alternatives,
products should address factors such as associated assumptions, likelihood, or implications
related to U.S. interests. Products also should identify indicators that, if detected, would affect
the likelihood of identified alternatives.
(5) Demonstrates customer relevance and addresses implications: Analytic products
should provide information and insight on issues relevant to the customers of U.S. intelligence
and address the implications of the information and analysis they provide. Products should add
value by addressing prospects, context, threats, or factors affecting opportunities for action.
(6) Uses clear and logical argumentation: Analytic products should present a clear
main analytic message up front. Products containing multiple judgments should have a main
analytic message that is drawn collectively from those judgments. All analytic judgments should
be effectively supported by relevant intelligence information and coherent reasoning. Language
and syntax should convey meaning unambiguously. Products should be internally consistent and
acknowledge significant supporting and contrary information affecting judgments.
(7) Explains change to or consistency of analytic judgments: Analytic products
should state how their major judgments on a topic are consistent with or represent a change from
those in previously published analysis, or represent initial coverage of a topic. Products need not
be lengthy or detailed in explaining change or consistency. They should avoid using boilerplate
language, however, and should make clear how new information or different reasoning led to the
judgments expressed in them. Recurrent products such as daily crisis reports should note any
changes in judgments; absent changes, recurrent products need not confirm consistency with
previous editions. Significant differences in analytic judgment, such as between two IC analytic
elements, should be fully considered and brought to the attention of customers.
(8) Makes accurate judgments and assessments: Analytic products should apply
expertise and logic to make the most accurate judgments and assessments possible, based on the
information available and known information gaps. In doing so, analytic products should present
all judgments that would be useful to customers, and should not avoid difficult judgments in
order to minimize the risk of being wrong. Inherent to the concept of accuracy is that the
analytic message a customer receives should be the one the analyst intended to send. Therefore,
analytic products should express judgments as clearly and precisely as possible, reducing
ambiguity by addressing the likelihood, timing, and nature of the outcome or development.
Clarity of meaning permits assessment for accuracy when all necessary information is available.
(9) Incorporates effective visual information where appropriate: Analytic products
should incorporate visual information to clarify an analytic message and to complement or
enhance the presentation of data and analysis. In particular, visual presentations should be used
when information or concepts (e.g., spatial or temporal relationships) can be conveyed better in
graphic form (e.g., tables, flow charts, images) than in written text. Visual information may
range from plain presentation of intelligence information to interactive displays for complex
information and analytic concepts. All of the content in an analytic product may be presented
6
ICD 203
visually. Visual information should always be clear and pertinent to the product's subject.
Analytic content in visual information should also adhere to other analytic tradecraft standards.
E. RESPONSIBILITIES
1. The Deputy Director for Mission Integration (DD/MI) shall:
a. Confirm and direct the application of these Analytic Standards by IC elements in
analytic intelligence products;
b. Conduct an IC-wide program of periodic review and evaluation of analytic
intelligence products, guided by the annual identification of functional or geographical areas of
analysis for specific review:
(1) Disseminate ODNI Analytic Tradecraft Standards Evaluation Rating Criteria to
IC elements;
(2) Prepare findings of analytic intelligence product reviews for reporting to
Congress and relevant IC elements;
(3) Develop lessons learned and identify exemplary products for use by IC elements
in training;
(4) Refine the IC-wide program of periodic review and evaluation based on new
lessons learned and best practices identified.
c. Assist IC elements in effective application of the Analytic Standards; and
d. Oversee analytic product evaluation programs in individual IC elements to ensure
standards and practices are compatible with the IC-wide program.
2. The ODNI Analytic Ombuds shall:
a. Serve as the DNI's principal advisor on safeguarding objectivity in intelligence
analysis;
b. Be a senior executive who reports directly to the DD/MI, but operates independently
and holds no other position within the ODNI to ensure a dedicated focus and to preserve
neutrality;
c. Serve as head of the IC Analytic Ombuds Community of Practice to posture the IC
with an integrated analytic ombuds program;
d. Issue guidance to analytic ombuds partners for consistent and effective practices and
promote awareness of the role, responsibilities, and practices, and how to engage ombuds;
e. Establish requirements for tracking and categorizing analytic complaints and
identifying performance measures to assess program effectiveness;
f. Adhere to International Ombuds Association Standards of Practice, which are;
independence, impartiality, informality, and confidentiality;
g. Remain current and well-informed of issues affecting IC analysis and promote
awareness of the requirement for analysis that is objective and independent of political
consideration;
7
ICD 203
h. Be available to analysts to counsel, conduct arbitration, offer recommendations, and,
as appropriate, initiate inquiries into real or perceived problems of analytic tradecraft or
politicization, biased reporting, or lack of objectivity in intelligence analysis.
(1) Analysts in IC elements other than the ODNI must first use existing
administrative procedures within their own IC element to raise concerns about adherence to
analytic standards;
(2) When these internal administrative procedures have been exhausted, or when an
analyst believes that those procedures will not preserve confidentiality, the analyst may bring
these concerns to the ODNI Analytic Ombuds;
(3) In such instances, the ODNI Analytic Ombuds will carry out responsibilities in
the same manner as ifresponding to an ODNI analyst's concerns. The ODNI Analytic Ombuds
may address concerns that span more than one IC element; and
i. Perform all responsibilities confidentially so that analysts may raise concerns without
fear of reprisal. However, confidentiality will not extend to significant misconduct, to violations
of law or ethics, or when otherwise precluded by law.
3. Heads ofIC elements shall:
a. Ensure that analytic intelligence products produced and disseminated by their element
properly apply the IC Analytic Standards;
b. Designate an individual or office responsible for responding to concerns raised by the
element's analysts about adherence to analytic standards (including tradecraft standards) in
analytic products;
c. Conduct internal programs ofreview and evaluation of analytic intelligence products
utilizing the IC Analytic Standards as the core criteria, and provide annual status reporting to the
DD/MI according to DD/MI guidelines; and
d. Ensure analysts receive annual training on the IC Analytic Standards contained in
Section D. of this Directive.

Sourcing Requ i rements for Disseminated
Analytic Products
A. AUTHORITY: The National Security Act of 1947, as amended; the
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004; Executive
Order 12333, as amended; and other applicable provisions of law.
B. PURPOSE: This Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) establishes
the requirements for sourcing information in disseminated analytic
products. This Directive supersedes ICD 206, Sourcing Requirements.for
Disseminated Analytic Products, 17 October 2007.
C. APPLICABILITY
l. This ICD applies to the Intelligence Community (IC), as defined by
the National Security Act of 1947, as amended; and to such elements of any
other department or agency as may be designated an element of the IC by
the President, or jointly by the DNI and the head of the department or
agency concerned.
2. This ICD applies to those disseminated analytic product types (or
product lines) developed by IC elements to convey analytic assessments
based predominantly on intelligence reports, diplomatic reports, or publicly
available information.
3. Applicable types of disseminated analytic products shall be
designated by IC elements in consultation with the Deputy Director of
National Intelligence for Intelligence Integration (DDNI/11), and be
identified in a central listing (hereafter, "covered analytic products").
D. POLICY
l. Sourcing information shall be included in covered analytic products
to enhance the credibility and transparency of intelligence analysis, and to
assist readers in making an informed assessment of the quality and scope of
sources underlying the analysis. Sourcing information shall enable readers
to discover and retrieve sources consistent with ICD 50 l, Discovery and
Dissemination or Retrieval of Information within the Intelligence
Community. Sourcing information in each product should be sufficient to
meet these purposes, while avoiding exhaustive source listings. Sourcing
information shall also be structured to enable assessment of the use and
utility of sourcing.
2. Every disseminated version of a covered analytic product shall
contain sourcing information, except in accordance with Sections D.4 and
D.7.
3. The presentation of sourcing information in covered analytic
products shall be in the form of source reference citations, appended
reference citations, source descriptors, and source summary statements.
Analysts should use a combination of these mechanisms to optimize clarity
and reader understanding.
ICD 206
a. Source reference citation (SRC): Cove ed analytic products shall contain SRCs.
(I) SRCs shall be presented as sequentially numbered endnotes that correlate to
superscript numbers in the main body of the analytic product.
(2) An SRC shall be generated each time a source is directly cited in product text
(e.g., "according to ...") or a specific aspect of analysis (i.e., judgment, assessment, estimate,
alternative hypothesis or view, confidence level) depends on a source.
(3) The relevance of a source referenced in an SRC should be clearly apparent if a
reader chooses to consult the source report directly; otherwise, the product text shall explain why
the source pertains (e .g., when the relevance of the source can be understood only in conjunction
with another source).
(4) An SRC should reference the most original source that presents the relevant
information in a form appropriate for use in analysi s.
(5) An SRC shall not be used to reference information that only meets the criteria for
an appended reference citation, as discussed in Section D.3.b, and is not directly cited in product
text.
(6) SRC endnotes shall include the following elements:
(a) Portion marking that presents the classification of the SRC;
(b) Identification of the information originator, author, producer, or owner. For
intelligence-based sources, this is the publishing IC element, named source originators or sub-
organization, or liaison service country of origin;
(c) An unambiguous source identifier. At least one unambiguous source
identifier that provides succinct source identifying, labeling, or tagging information that enables
unambiguous and efficient location and retrieval of the source;
(d) A title for the source document or information with volume and issue number
if applicable, and if included, the title classification. The title of an intelligence-based report may
be omitted if necessary and consistent with guidance in Section D.4.c;
(e) The date of issuance, publication, or posting. If date of online posting is
unknown, then date of online access;
(f) Page number, if applicable;
(g) Classification of the information extracted from the source;
(h) Overall classification of the source document; and
(i) A source descriptor. If the source descriptor is included in the main body of
the product, it is optional in the SRC. If the source descriptor is extracted from the source and
includes a portion marking different from the SRC cl assification, the portion marking shall be
included.
(7) Unique or emergent types of sources or media to which the set of SRC elements
above do not adequately apply shall be identified to the implementing authority to consider
establishing guidance, which shall be developed in consultation with IC elements and published
in the form of an IC Standard.
2
ICD 206
b. Appended reference citation (ARC): An ARC is appropriate for information that
relates to analysis in a supplemental or complementary way, but does not expressly affect or
support a specific aspect or outcome of analysis. ARCs may be used to provide further reading
options or to show broader context or background. AR Cs are an appropriate method for
identifying insights or other data gleaned from analytic outreach that contributes to a covered
analytic product, especially if not conveyed in an RC.
(I) Inclusion of ARCs in covered analytic products is optional.
(2) ARCs shall not be included solely to delineate the overall scope of analytic
inquiry or research involved in preparation of the covered analytic product.
(3) ARCs, if included, shall be listed separately from, and after, SRCs. Each ARC
shall include at least the following elements:
(a) Portion marking that presents the classification of the ARC;
(b) If the reference information is accessible, source identifying, labeling, or
tagging information that enables unambiguous and efficient location and retrieval of the
referenced information; and
(c) A succinct explanation for why the ARC is being included (e.g., provides
further information re lated to an SRC or a specific passage in the body of the product or notesI
the use of analytic outreach or other type of engagement or analytic technique).
c. Source descriptor: A source descriptor should be included in the main body of the
text. If not, a source descriptor shall be included in the SRC. A source descriptor is used in
conjunction with an SRC to describe source qualitative factors germane to specific product
judgments, or when the time of pertinent information in a source is significantly different from
the time of publication of the source.
(1) Source descriptors for intelligence-based or diplomatic sources shall be derived
from source documents. If a source descriptor is substantially changed from the source, this
shall be indicated, with a rationale.
(2) Analysts may devise their own source descriptors for sources of publicly
available information not obtained from an IC-produced open source report.
(3) For a source directly cited in product text (e.g., "according to ... ."), the source
descriptor should also appear in product text and be clearly associated .
d. Source summary statement: Source summary statements are strongly encouraged in
covered analytic products to provide a holistic assessment of sourcing that supports a covered
analytic product.
(I) The importance of including a source summary statement increases with the
complexity of a product, complexity of the sources, or the number of sources cited.
(2) A source summary statement should cover strengths and weaknesses of the
source base, which sources are most important to key judgments, what sources are meaningfully
corroborative or conflicting, and should highlight any specific subject matter expertise used to
develop the assessment.
4. The presentation of sourcing information shall be subject to IC policy on classification
and control markings and foreign disclosure and re lease. The sensitivity of sourcing information
3
presented shall be consistent with the classificatio and controls intended for the covered
analytic product.
ICD 206
a. Downgraded or sanitized copies of covered analytic products should contain sourcing
information. In instances where covered analytic products are intended for public release,
sourcing information will be removed prior to publication . Sourcing information shall be
appropriately modified, or if necessary, removed, from downgraded or sanitized copies of a
covered analytic product, consistent with ICD 710, Classification Management and Control
Markings System .
h. In covered analytic products that include a tcarline, SRCs should be inserted after the
body of the report and before the tcarline version.
c. If necessary, one or more SRC data clements can be omitted so that the resulting
endnote does not exceed the classification of the main body, but still provides sufficient
information to search and discover the source in an appropriately authorized system.
ct . If an IC Identifier (IC-ID) is used to meet the requirement of the unambiguous source
identifier, it may remain as the only SRC element after downgrading or sanitization because IC-
IDs are unclassified and releasable.
5. If citing a source that is dynamic (e.g., from an Internet posting), ephemeral (e.g., an
analyst phone conversation), or not subject to an IC element's policy for systematic storage for
analyst access (e.g., a chat session transcript or briefing), a record of the source shall be
preserved for retention by the IC clement producing the covered analytic product for at least one
year. If this requirement conflicts with an IC element's internal record keeping policies, the IC
clement may request an exemption in accordance with Section D. 7. For products with a
specified time horizon, a period for which the judgments remain valid (e.g., National Intelligence
Estimates), applicable source information shall be retained for the period of the time horizon or
five years, whichever is shorter. This section does not supersede retention limits prescribed in
law, Executive Order, or Presidential directive.
6. The covered analytic product with all appropriate sourcing information shall be retained
as a document of record, along with associated downgraded, sanitized, or tcarline products.
Consistent with the implementation of ICD 50 I, identical versions shall also be submitted to the
Library of National Intelligence or successor systems.
7. An IC element may request exemption from specific provisions of this Directive for an
identified covered analytic product type, if it foresees mission critical circumstances that will
consistently prevent compliance. Exemption requests must be submitted in writing to the
DDNI/11 for adjudication, and describe the specific factors that render the requirements
infeasible for that covered analytic product type.
8. If it is not feasible to produce a covered analytic product with all appropriate sourcing
information prior to dissemination (e.g., due to urgent requirements in a crisis or time-sensitive
or unit-level military operations), the product shall be re -issued with all appropriate sourcing
information as soon as feasible, but not more than 30 days thereafter, in accordance with Section
D.6.
9. As soon as practicable and under the direction of the DDNI/II in coordination with the IC
CIO, the IC shall adopt a method to provide customized, Public Key Infrastructure-enabled
access to cited source material without additional textual references .
4
E. !ROLES AND IRESPONSIB IL TIES

ICD 206
APPENDIX - GLOSSARY
Appended reference citation (ARC) - A specified set of descriptive elements about
information that relates to analysis in a supplemental or complementary way, but that does not
expressly affect or support a specific aspect or outcome of analysis. ARCs may refer to
information considered with sources in the development of analysis, or may refer to information
that provides broader context or background.
Covered analytic product - A subset of disseminated analytic products designated by IC
elements in consultation with the DDNUII that fall under the authority of ICD 206.
Disseminated analytic product - Any intelligence product, such as an assessment, study,
estimate, compilation, database, graphic, or interactive publication, created by the analytic
component of an IC clement, reviewed or validated by that IC clement, and disseminated to
consumers outside that IC element.
Source - An originator or discrete parcel of data or information that provides material that
comprises, contributes to, affects, or is used to evaluate, the basis for intelligence analysis. A
source can be a person, document, pa<;sage, quotati n, data record, database, tweet, email, book,
web page, etc. Source identifying parameters and characteristics are described in source
reference citations, source descriptors, and source summary statements.
Source descriptor - A brief, narrative exposition of factors that affect or indicate the quality or
credibility of a single source. These factors are distinct from the information elements in a
source reference citation . Source descriptor factors may include accuracy and completeness,
possible denial and deception, age and continued currency of information, and technical elements
of collection as well as source access, validation, motivation, possible bias, or expertise. When a
source's relevance is unlikely to be apparent if a reader consults the source report directly, a
source descriptor may also include an explanation of the source's relevance.
Source reference citation (SRC) - A specified set of factual information clements about a
source, presented in uniform format in an endnote. Information in SRCs enables readers to
locate and retrieve the source, and may help readers assess the quality or credibility of the
source.
Source summary statement - An explanation of quality, credibility, or validity factors that
pertain for sources considered together - usually fo r the whole set of sources upon which a
disseminated analytic product is based.
Sourcing information - Descriptive information about sources or reference information,
presented in covered analytic products as SRCs, ARCs, source descriptors, and source summary
statements.

Detailed Outline

This outline provides a comprehensive overview of the "Handbook of Bayesian Analysis for Intelligence," detailing its structure, key concepts, and practical guidance for intelligence analysts.

Summary

    Purpose: To explain the use of the Bayesian approach as a forecasting tool for intelligence, serving as a self-help guide for potential users.

    Audience: Intelligence analysts and managers of intelligence production.

    Core Idea: The handbook promotes the utility of Bayesian analysis for producing concise, informative, and reproducible intelligence reports, moving beyond traditional qualitative analysis. It stresses practical application over methodological perfection.

I. Bayes: Introduction and Fundamentals

    Capabilities and Benefits:

        Provides a rational, consistent, and objective process to combine disparate facts into an overall assessment.

        Extracts more information from available data by systematically weighing each piece of evidence.

        Creates a reproducible sequence of analytical steps, making disagreements easier to pinpoint.

        Forces analysts to consider alternative explanations for evidence, mitigating confirmation bias.

        Allows for quantitative, graphical display of judgments, avoiding ambiguous terms like "probable" or "likely."

        Demonstrated to be less conservative than informal judgments, moving probabilities away from 50/50 more decisively.

        Ensures continuous monitoring of key intelligence questions.

    When is it Useful?

        The problem must be formulable into a set of specific, mutually exclusive outcomes (scenarios), e.g., "war vs. no war."

        There must be a relatively rich and continuous flow of data related to the question.

        The activity being analyzed must produce preliminary signs or indicators, not be a random event.

        The level of importance of the question determines the resources available.

II. How to Initiate a Bayesian Exercise

    Flowchart of Setup Procedure: A visual guide outlining the key steps from question definition to practice runs.

    Defining the Scenarios (Hypotheses):

        The crucial first step: formulating the intelligence question into categories that are mutually exclusive and cover all relevant possibilities.

        Simple Dichotomy Example (Vietnam):

            A. North Vietnam will launch a major offensive.

            B. North Vietnam will not launch such an offensive.

        Complex Multi-Scenario Example (Sino-Soviet):

            A. Soviet nuclear strike.

            B. Soviet large-scale conventional attack.

            C. Soviet localized attack.

            D. Chinese localized attack.

            E. Instigated minority revolt.

            F. No hostilities.

    Participants:

        Enlist a wide variety of experts (political, economic, strategic, imagery, etc.) to provide a rich mix of evidence and balance biases.

        The number can range from one to a large group (OPR examples used 6-13).

    Time Span and Frequency:

        Determined by data volume and urgency.

        OPR reports were issued at intervals from one to six weeks, lasting for six months to a year.

    Designing the Format:

        Crucial for communicating results effectively, especially if the report is for high-level consumers.

        Involves designing graphs and the overall publication layout.

    An Initial Meeting:

        Explain the rationale, format, and procedures to all participants.

        Collect administrative details and, most importantly, the initial "starting probabilities" for each scenario from each analyst.

    Practice Runs:

        Essential for familiarizing analysts with the routine and working out logistical issues before formal publication.

III. The OPR (Office of Political Research) Bayesian Analyses

This section details the specific techniques and presentational styles developed by OPR.

    More than One Analyst:

        Utilized a group of analysts to get a range of expertise and a richer mix of evidence.

        To avoid groupthink, analysts made their probabilistic assessments individually.

    Printing the Evidence:

        Each periodic report included the raw evidence items used by the panel.

        This allowed readers to see the basis for the assessments and make their own judgments.

    Graphs and Visibility:

        A core strength of the method.

        Broken-Line Charts: Excellent for showing trends over time for each analyst or for group averages (e.g., Vietnam study).

        Bar Charts: Used to show the range of probabilities (low, average, high) for multiple scenarios at a single point in time (e.g., Sino-Soviet study).

        Supplementary Non-Bayesian Graphs: Used to track related concepts like "level of tension" and provide an outlet for analysts' overall subjective feelings.

    Identifying the Participants:

        Listing participants by name and identifying their assessments on graphs increased motivation and provided a medium for individual expression.

IV. How to Manage an On-Going Bayes

    Flowchart of Periodic Procedure: A visual guide for the recurring process of evidence collection, evaluation, computation, and reporting.

    Routine Procedure:

        Day 1: Analysts submit new items of evidence. Coordinator consolidates and distributes the complete list.

        Day 2: Analysts individually evaluate the items and return their numerical assessments.

    The Calculations:

        Starting Probabilities: An analyst's initial, subjective judgment of the likelihood of each scenario.

        Conditional Probabilities: The core of the periodic assessment. For each piece of evidence, the analyst asks: "How likely (0-100%) would I be to see this evidence if Scenario A were true? If Scenario B were true?" etc.

        A. The Basic Method: Uses the full Bayesian formula to update probabilities. Best handled by a computer program.

        B. The Simplified Method: For either-or questions. Uses ratios of probabilities, which can be multiplied and calculated by hand.

    Problems in Mid-course:

        Managing individuals, logistical delays, holidays, and dropouts.

    Terminating and Evaluating a Bayes:

        Termination can be tied to a fixed date or be indefinite for on-going monitoring.

        Evaluation focuses on the accuracy of prediction. The handbook notes that OPR's studies at the time had successfully predicted "non-events."

V. Inherent Weaknesses and Problems of the Bayesian Technique

    Limited Applicability: Only works for specific types of well-defined questions.

    Data Problems:

        Relevance: Deciding which evidence to include. OPR's solution was to let expert analysts decide.

        Source Reliability: Handled by letting the analyst's confidence in a source be reflected in the probability assigned, rather than adding a separate "reliability" score.

        Negative Evidence: The problem that the absence of evidence can be significant. Partially addressed by having analysts assess the likelihood of the observed volume of data.

    Problems Over Time:

        Managing a moving timeframe (e.g., "hostilities within the next six months") requires decisions on when to discard old data.

    Problems with Numbers:

        A zero probability is final and must be avoided (use a very small number instead).

        Analysts vary in their comfort with probabilistic thinking and may require training.

    Manipulation:

        An analyst might consciously skew their numbers. This was partly mitigated by providing supplementary graphs where they could express their opinions more directly.

A Comprehensive Guide to the Methodology and Implementation of Bayesian Analysis in Intelligence

This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the methodology and practical implementation of Bayesian analysis as a forecasting tool, based on the 1975 CIA handbook. The goal is to furnish a document comprehensive enough for an individual or team to understand the underlying philosophy and reproduce the process.
Part 1: Justification and Philosophical Foundation

The core philosophy behind using Bayesian analysis in intelligence is to impose a structured, rational, and repeatable framework onto the inherently subjective process of evaluating evidence. Traditional analysis often relies on inductive logic and qualitative language ("likely," "probable"), which can be ambiguous and susceptible to cognitive biases.

The Bayesian approach is designed to solve several key problems:

    Inconsistency: It provides a consistent mathematical rule for updating beliefs. An analyst's judgment is not swayed by the most recent or emotionally resonant piece of evidence, but is instead an aggregation of all evidence considered.

    Hidden Assumptions: It forces analysts to make their assumptions explicit. By assigning a numerical probability to how evidence relates to a hypothesis, the analyst's reasoning becomes transparent and auditable.

    Confirmation Bias: The methodology requires the analyst to evaluate evidence against all competing hypotheses, not just their favored one. This systematically forces consideration of alternative explanations.

    Vagueness: It replaces ambiguous words with quantitative probabilities, allowing for clearer communication of uncertainty and disagreement. The results can be tracked and visualized over time, revealing trends in a way that prose cannot.

    Underutilization of Data: The technique allows for the systematic accumulation of many small, seemingly marginal pieces of evidence, which in aggregate can outweigh a single, more dramatic report.

In essence, the method is not a "truth machine." It is an organizing device that combines an analyst's expert judgment with a rigorous, objective mathematical formula. Its primary purpose is utility and clarity, not methodological perfection.
Part 2: Phase 1 - Project Design and Initiation

This is the most critical phase. A poorly designed exercise will produce irrelevant or misleading results.

Step 1: Formulate the Intelligence Question and Scenarios
The question must be broken down into a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) scenarios or hypotheses. This means the scenarios should not overlap, and together they should cover all plausible outcomes.

    Simple Dichotomy (Good for Yes/No questions):

        Question: Will North Vietnam launch a major offensive before June 1974?

        Scenario A: Yes, they will.

        Scenario B: No, they will not.

    Complex Set (Good for nuanced situations):

        Question: What will be the nature of Sino-Soviet hostilities in the next six months?

        Scenario A: Soviet nuclear strike.

        Scenario B: Soviet large-scale conventional attack.

        Scenario C: Soviet localized attack.

        Scenario D: Chinese localized attack.

        Scenario E: Instigated minority revolt.

        Scenario F: No hostilities of the types listed above (the "null" hypothesis).

Step 2: Assemble the Participant Team
A diverse team is crucial for mitigating individual and organizational bias.

    Composition: Enlist a range of experts (6-13 is a good number) from different fields: political, military, economic, imagery analysis, etc.

    Role: Each participant contributes evidence from their area of expertise and provides their own independent assessments. To avoid groupthink, there are no group discussions for assigning probabilities; all work is done individually and submitted to a central coordinator.

Step 3: Determine Time Span and Frequency
The cadence of the exercise depends on the tempo of the intelligence problem.

    Frequency: Reports can be issued weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. This can be adjusted as a situation heats up or cools down.

    Duration: The exercise can be designed to terminate on a specific date (e.g., the end of the dry season for a potential offensive) or run indefinitely with a "sliding window" timeframe (e.g., "what is the probability of an event in the next six months?").

Step 4: Design the Reporting Format
The output must be clear, concise, and useful to consumers.

    Graphical Display: This is a key benefit. Use broken-line charts to show trends over time and bar charts to compare probabilities across multiple scenarios at a single point in time. Show the average, but also the range (high/low) of analyst opinions to display the degree of consensus or disagreement.

    Evidence Log: The report should include the list of evidence items that the analysts evaluated. This makes the reasoning transparent.

    Analyst Visibility: Listing participants by name and, where appropriate, showing their individual assessment lines on a graph, increases accountability and motivation.

Step 5: Hold the Initial Meeting and Set Starting Probabilities
This is the formal kickoff.

    Procedure: The coordinator explains the entire process, the scenarios, and the evaluation method.

    Starting Probabilities (Priors): Each analyst, working alone, provides their initial, subjective "best guess" for the probability of each scenario being true. These numbers must sum to 100%. This is the only time they will assess the scenarios directly. From this point forward, they will only assess the evidence.

Step 6: Conduct Practice Runs
Run one or two full cycles of the exercise as practice. This is essential for working out logistical kinks and ensuring all analysts understand the procedure, especially the concept of assigning conditional probabilities.
Part 3: Phase 2 - The Recurring Analytical Cycle

Once initiated, the exercise runs in a continuous loop.

Step 1: Evidence Collection and Consolidation (Coordinator's Role)
On the first day of the cycle, each analyst submits relevant items of evidence they have observed since the last cycle. The coordinator consolidates these into a single, de-duplicated list and distributes it to all participants.

Step 2: Individual Analyst Evaluation (The Core of the Method)
This is the most important cognitive step for the analyst. For each item of evidence, the analyst answers the following question, assigning a probability from 0-100% for each scenario:

    "How likely would I be to see this specific piece of evidence IF Scenario [X] were true?"

They repeat this for every scenario (A, B, C, etc.). These are the conditional probabilities. Note that these numbers do not need to sum to 100.

    Example:

        Evidence: "TASS reports Chinese military buildup on the border."

        Analyst's Assessment:

            How likely would I see this report if a Soviet nuclear strike (Scenario A) was being planned? "Maybe 70% likely, as it could be part of the justification."

            How likely would I see this report if a Soviet localized attack (Scenario C) was planned? "90% likely."

            How likely would I see this report if no hostilities (Scenario F) were planned? "50% likely, as this is common propaganda."

The most diagnostic evidence is that which has the greatest spread in probabilities across the scenarios. Evidence that is equally likely under all scenarios has no diagnostic value and will not change the outcome.

Step 3: Computation (Coordinator's Role)
The coordinator takes each analyst's starting probabilities and their set of conditional probabilities for the new evidence and computes the revised probabilities for that analyst. This is done for each analyst independently.

    The Basic Method (for any number of scenarios): This uses the full Bayesian formula (see Part 4) and is best done with a computer program. For each item of evidence, the previous probabilities are updated to create new ones, which then become the starting point for the next item of evidence.

    The Simplified Method (for two, either/or scenarios): This is faster and can be done by hand.

        Convert probabilities to odds ratios (e.g., 75% for A and 25% for B becomes 75/25 or 3/1).

        For each piece of evidence, the analyst provides a ratio of the conditional probabilities (e.g., if evidence is 90% likely under A and 10% likely under B, the ratio is 90/10 or 9/1).

        Multiply the starting odds ratio by all the evidence ratios to get a final odds ratio.

        Convert the final odds ratio back to a percentage.

Step 4: Reporting and Visualization
The coordinator compiles the results, updates the graphs, writes a brief summary of trends, and disseminates the final report. The revised probabilities for each analyst from this round become their starting probabilities for the next round.
Part 4: The Mathematical Engine

The formula looks complex, but its components are straightforward.

Bayes' Theorem:

P(Si​∣I)=∑i=1m​(P(Si​)×P(I∣Si​))P(Si​)×P(I∣Si​)​

Where:

    P(Si​∣I) is the Revised Probability of a scenario (Si​) being true, given the new item of evidence (I). This is what you are solving for.

    P(Si​) is the Starting (Prior) Probability of that scenario being true (from the previous round).

    P(I∣Si​) is the Conditional Probability—the analyst's judgment of how likely the evidence (I) would be if the scenario (Si​) were true.

    The denominator (∑...) is a normalization factor. It is the sum of (Prior × Conditional) for all scenarios. It ensures the final revised probabilities add up to 100%.

Computational Tools:
The handbook provides simple interactive programs in APL and BASIC to automate these calculations, preventing arithmetic errors and saving significant time for the coordinator.
Part 5: Managing Challenges and Limitations

Successful implementation requires awareness of the technique's inherent problems.

    Data Problems:

        Relevance & Reliability: The methodology relies on the analyst's expert judgment to filter irrelevant information and to implicitly weigh source reliability in the conditional probabilities they assign. There is no separate score for "reliability."

        Negative Evidence: The absence of expected evidence can be highly significant. This is addressed by having analysts evaluate an item like: "How likely is it that we would see exactly this volume of information (no more, no less) if Scenario X were true?"

    Temporal Problems:

        For exercises with a "sliding window" timeframe, a decision must be made on how to handle old data. The OPR's solution was to only use the most recent three months of evidence evaluations.

    Human and Numerical Factors:

        Zero Probability: An analyst must never assign a probability of 0, as this mathematically eliminates a scenario forever. A very small number (e.g., 1%) should be used instead.

        Probabilistic Thinking: Some analysts are uncomfortable thinking in numbers. The coordinator must be prepared to provide one-on-one coaching, using the results of calculations to show analysts how their judgments impact the outcome.

        Manipulation: An analyst may try to "game" the system to get a desired outcome. This is best mitigated by providing a supplementary, non-Bayesian graph where they can express their overall subjective opinion directly, giving them an outlet that doesn't corrupt the primary analysis.
