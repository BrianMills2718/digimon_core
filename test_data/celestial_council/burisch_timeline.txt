1989
	The chronicles of Dan’s professional training curriculum are not exhaustive, however in the period 1982-85 he is accredited as a biologist and owner of Crain Environment Research in Las Vegas; in 1986 he received his bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and was approached as a candidate to work on a government project; in 1988 St Patrick’s Seminary in Menlo Park, California, awarded him a Master of Divinity and in 1989 he obtained a PhD in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics from the State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook; SUNY has already denied having documentation on the matter, nevertheless there are documents that attest to Dan’s training.
	In the military, he obtained the rank of captain of the United States Navy in 1989 and was assigned to the Aquarius Project at the base Groom Lake, Nevada, commonly known as Area 51 or “Dreamland”; his S4 card was no. 6196 MAJI. A secrecy agreement for the Tonopah Test Range / R4809, dated October 14, 1989 and signed by Burisch (Crain), reports its SSAIN, grade “05”, qualification “MB III” (Microbiology III) and the entity it depended on, namely the Department of Defense Naval Research Laboratory, United States Navy. A subsequent document reports his rank as captain of the US Naval Reserve, and his qualification “Microbiologist IV”.

	In 1989, Dr. Burisch was assigned, as a microbiologist, to Project Aquarius, R-4800, Papoose Site 4 (S4) at the Nevada test site, in the same location as Robert Lazar, although the co-presence of the two was rather brief; finally, around 1994, was promoted to the position of Working Group Leader, according to him by virtue of the excellent professional relationship with J-Rod, and worked in the underground biological laboratory which had been set up at Level 4.

1990
	In 1990 he married Deborah Kay Burisch, already the mother of a child born from a previous marriage; in 1995 Dan changed his surname to Burisch to match the child’s legal name.

1991 
	he was sent to carry out his duties at a biological warfare unit and participated in the “Desert Storm” operation in Ira

1994
	Dr. Burisch was told there was a serious medical problem with the J-Rod and his species and that MJ-12 wanted Dan to extract tissue from the being’s arm for microscopic study. A serious peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed and Dr. Burisch said in the year 1994, he collected more than 100 tissue samples in an effort to study the J-Rod’s nerve damage and to perhaps develop a treatment.

	Peripheral neuropathy, a result of damage to the nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerves), often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet. It can also affect other areas and body functions including digestion, urination and circulation.Aug 11, 2022

Pre-1998
	First, prior to the publication of Eagles Disobey the Case for Inca City, Mars, Dr. Dan was listed as DOCTOR in the following places: State University of New York at Stony Brook (evidenced by his being acclimated by them through background checks completed by Marquis´ Who´s Who in the World, Science and Engineering, the West. They can´t be paid to place a name in, as some have suggested.
	
	From <https://www.angelfire.com/pe/peter7/project_otus/DanBcredentials.html> 
	
	Their good name is as stake. He was also backrounded by the Fiesta Casino in Las Vegas when he was placed in charge of Safety under their Director of Security. How can I prove that? His business card!) Before Eagles he was confirmed as Ph.D. by the UNLV Alumni Association. How can I confirm that? Page 38 in the 1997 Alumni Directory. Want to know a secret? (of course you do!) He still is in their Alumni Directory, listed under GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.
	
	From <https://www.angelfire.com/pe/peter7/project_otus/DanBcredentials.html> 
	He was listed with his Ph.D. in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Naturalist Society, and the American Institute of Biological Sciences. All conveniently can´t research their rosters for those years (90-97) - for all those that checked.
	
	From <https://www.angelfire.com/pe/peter7/project_otus/DanBcredentials.html> 
	
	He is still listed in the U.S. Navy Memorial Log. 
	
	From <https://www.angelfire.com/pe/peter7/project_otus/DanBcredentials.html> 
	
	Let´s look at his work for a minute. I am aware that Dan supplied a certain researcher ( Hi, Bill! ) and B.J. Wolf with a list of names of professors he worked with at SUNY. Of course no one will conveniently remember him, but..it just so happens that many of them are just coincidentally involved with research of the same type he engaged in with the work on the jrod. Glycoproteins, for instance.

	Eagles Disobey - Vol. 1 BJ Wolfe (Marcia McDowell) 385 Fairway Rd. S., Suite 4A-179 Kitchener, ON Canada, N2C-2N9 BJWolf007@rogers.com Cover / Introduction I came to know Dr. Dan Burisch (formerly Dan Crain, Ph.D.) many years ago in Las Vegas NV. He and his family became friends with my family and eventually I came to know his story well. He asked me in 1997 to write a book about one of his research projects. That became Eagles Disobey: The Case for Inca City, Mars and was released to the public in 1998. During that work I came to know a great deal about Dan's involvement in dark projects that are covertly funded by our military and government bodies including his work up at Area-51 or -- as it is known by those who work up there -- "Watertown Strip". Dan became afraid, desperately afraid for his life toward the end of the work on Eagles Disobey. He was terrified of retaliation from his dark project supervisors because he refused to stop looking into the anomalies on Mars and because he had shared with me many of his experiences "up north" while he was employed in Project Aquarius ( and had familiarity with projects Sigma and Looking Glass). Toward the end of 1998 Dan disappeared. His residence was abandoned overnight, and nobody seemed to know where he had been taken. He turned up halfway across-the-country with most of his memories concerning his association with me and our work on Eagles Disobey altered or erased. I tried my best to remind him of his past, but he did not believe me until I showed him a copy of the book and photographs of himself sitting on my couch playing with the dogs. He returned to his new location, but memories started to break through the "conditioning" to such an extent that Dan fled and was eventually recaptured and whisked off to a military base for re-"conditioning".

	3.0 out of 5 stars The Search for Signs of Life on Mars
	Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2015
	
	Early on in this book, there is a quote from NASA's Photo Gallery: Mars, in which what the authors term "Inca City" is described as an "unusual rectilinear structure associated with the south polar pitted terrain" which contains "cells" that are 4-5 km wide. The Mariner-9 image of the area is included, as is an illustration of the foundation-layout of Machu Picchu. The authors claim that the Martian Inca City bears "such a striking resemblance" to Machu Picchu and most of the rest of the book is devoted to the search for other features of the Martian Inca City region that feature Incan imagery. CGI enhancements are then used to produce images such as those that appear on the cover of the book.
	
	I got bored of it quite quickly. However, an unexpected development comes as the principal author, the pseudonymous B. J. Wolf, discovers that one of the Mars researchers, Dan Burisch, apparently has a mysterious background. Did he or did he not work in Restricted Area 4809 at the USN DoD Naval Research Laboratory? Did he or did he not, in 1988-89 work at the Papoose Lake facility in Groom Lake on Q4 secret project AQ-J-Rod? Burisch doesn't say. As Wolf wonders about his background, weird things start happening when she is in internet communication with Burisch and mysterious shadowy intelligence types appear online to warn her off.

2002 Summer
	Dan became upset by what he was learning and in a whistle-blowing effort, Dr. Burisch began to leak information to longtime UFO researcher and Executive Director of Skywatch International, Bill Hamilton, in the summer and fall of 2002. That year, Bill played audiotaped and videotaped interviews for me of Dr. Burisch talking about his microbiology research of the extraterrestrial being’s neuropathy and a complicated threat that has come to be known as the Time Convergence Paradox.

	Dr. Burisch recounts his experiences at S-4 (part of the legendary complex known collectively as Area 51) and also of the time he was taken to a facility code-named "Sweetness" at Dulce, New Mexico. While there, Dan is "asked" but refuses to work on a project that involved the use of an alien retrovirus recombined with a terrestrial genome. Dr. Burisch explains in detail his experience at the facility at Dulce and states that there are "processes underway where they are in fact producing hybrids."

	From <https://www.angelfire.com/pe/peter7/Links/BurischBillH.TranscriptSept02.html> 
	
	It was this videotape, together with the Q94-109a Document and what was to become known as the "18-Pager", along with correspondence from within S-4, that convinced Don (Dep) that not only was Dan Burisch real.
	
	The following September, having received his copy at the beginning of 2003, Don became fearful at the possibility that he and his family would be targeted merely by possessing it after it became known that BJ had mysteriously disappeared, Dodie and John´s home broken into and the tape, together with all evidence of Dan´s existence, removed. It was then that Bill announced on his Skywatch list that he was ´closing down the investigation´, thus prompting the emergence of the ´golden thread´ on Oct. 2, 2003, at GLP (Godlikeproductions).

	Re: Mystery Of Dr. Dan Burisch !!!IMPORTANT!!!
	GLP FORUM
	For the cast of characters in this drama, which began before this thread did, here are the main players:
	Dr. Dan Burisch - brilliant microbiologist employed by Majestic 12/Naval Research Laboratory at S4, a top-secret facility near Area 51. Also co-author of "Eagles Disobey: The Case for Inca City, Mars". -:- CREDENTIALS
	BJ Wolf (Marci): co-author of "Eagles Disobey...", who began receiving emails from colleagues of Dr. Burisch inside S4 that exposed his real job, which had to do with analyzing tissue from an EBE (Extra-terrestrial Biological Entity), specifically a J-rod [an entity from our future, via Zeta Reticuli]. The purpose of analyzing this tissue was to determine the cause of a neurological degradation the EBE was enduring, and hopefully find a cure for it. The first explosive document leaked, the "smoking gun", was the now-famous "Q94-109a" document. It was followed by numerous emails to BJ who confronted her co-author and asked if it was all true, to which he reluctantly admitted it was.

	Bill Hamilton: The world-reknowned UFO researcher (Bill Comments) who BJ contacted to help get to the bottom of the story that this email correspondence was alluding to. Bill came to know Dan (a/k/a Dr B) personally and had several meetings with him, interviewing him at length on several occasions, most notably on Sept 18, 2002. It was a videotaped copy of this interview that I received, during a year-long surveillance which is now ending (if we are to believe Preserve Destiny/Peace and the other non-illuminati humans at the heart of Majestic 12) which prompted my own involvement in this story.

	 On April 22, 2004, Dan Burisch requested a hearing in the United States Congress to disclose information in his possession about Area 51 and the secret projects conducted there by the United States government, relating to viruses developed in the laboratory, alien interactions and treated.

	From <https://www.myuforesearch.it/language/en/dan-burischs-revelations-about-aliens/> 
	
	Dschaak and Allan focused their efforts on the office of Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, due to his position as Advisor to the Judicial Committee. They also contacted other Senate members from Idaho, Utah, and Nevada, where Dshaak, Allan, and Burisch reside, respectively.
	A Hatch staff member met with Dschaak and Allan about the subject of their request, and said the case was within the competence of the Security Committee, while Senator Hatch paused the conference for a moment to hear the case. . His staff member then informed Dschaak and Allan that there were thousands of cases that should be heard by Congress.

	Crain Ministries was co-founded by Dr Dan Crain and Marcia Crain, DD. The mission, started in 2008, while driving back from a presentation they made at Caltech, in Pasadena. Dr. Marci said she'd always wanted to try to help feed people on the streets who were homeless, and maybe eventually start reaching out to people who needed help getting back into society.
