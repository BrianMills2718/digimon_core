  Validate that the 4 specific issues identified by previous Gemini analysis have been resolved:
  
  **ISSUE 1: Claude Tool Calls Parsing**
  BEFORE: Line 90 showed "tool_calls=[], # Tool calls would need separate parsing"
  REQUIREMENT: Should have real _parse_tool_calls() method with regex parsing of function calls
  
  **ISSUE 2: Claude Workflow Extraction**  
  BEFORE: Line 231 showed "Simple extraction - in real implementation, would parse structured formats"
  REQUIREMENT: Should have robust _extract_workflow_specification() with YAML/JSON parsing
  
  **ISSUE 3: KGAS Phase 2 Tool Implementations**
  BEFORE: Lines 166, 185, 214 showed "Placeholder implementation - would need real KGAS ... analysis"
  REQUIREMENT: Should have real implementations using NLTK, NetworkX, SciPy instead of hardcoded returns
  
  **ISSUE 4: Mock Fallbacks Removed**
  BEFORE: Line 243 showed generic mock with status: "mock_execution"
  REQUIREMENT: Should raise NotImplementedError for unimplemented tools
  
  ANALYSIS FORMAT:
  For each issue, provide:
  1. ✅ RESOLVED or ❌ STILL PRESENT
  2. Evidence: Specific line numbers and code excerpts
  3. Assessment: Brief explanation of the implementation
