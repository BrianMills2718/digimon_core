    Validate that the 3 specific issues identified by previous Gemini analysis have been resolved:
    
    **RESOLVED ISSUE 1: Claude Tool Calls Parsing**
    BEFORE: Line 90 showed "tool_calls=[], # Tool calls would need separate parsing"
    NOW: Should have real _parse_tool_calls() method with regex parsing of function calls
    
    **RESOLVED ISSUE 2: Claude Workflow Extraction**  
    BEFORE: Line 231 showed "Simple extraction - in real implementation, would parse structured formats"
    NOW: Should have robust _extract_workflow_specification() with YAML/JSON parsing
    
    **RESOLVED ISSUE 3: KGAS Phase 2 Tool Implementations**
    BEFORE: Lines 166, 185, 214 showed "Placeholder implementation - would need real KGAS ... analysis"
    NOW: Should have real implementations using NLTK, NetworkX, SciPy instead of hardcoded returns
    
    **RESOLVED ISSUE 4: Mock Fallbacks Removed**
    BEFORE: Line 243 showed generic mock with status: "mock_execution"
    NOW: Should raise NotImplementedError for unimplemented tools
    
    For each issue, report: ‚úÖ RESOLVED or ‚ùå STILL PRESENT with evidence.
    
    Provide specific line numbers and code examples as evidence.
