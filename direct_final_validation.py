CODEBASE ANALYSIS REQUEST

Please critically evaluate this codebase to validate that specific integration issues have been resolved.

CODEBASE:
{codebase}

VALIDATION REQUEST:

Validate that the 4 specific issues identified by previous Gemini analysis have been resolved:

**ISSUE 1: Claude Tool Calls Parsing**
BEFORE: Line 90 showed "tool_calls=[], # Tool calls would need separate parsing"
REQUIREMENT: Should have real _parse_tool_calls() method with regex parsing of function calls

**ISSUE 2: Claude Workflow Extraction**  
BEFORE: Line 231 showed "Simple extraction - in real implementation, would parse structured formats"
REQUIREMENT: Should have robust _extract_workflow_specification() with YAML/JSON parsing

**ISSUE 3: KGAS Phase 2 Tool Implementations**
BEFORE: Lines 166, 185, 214 showed "Placeholder implementation - would need real KGAS ... analysis"
REQUIREMENT: Should have real implementations using NLTK, NetworkX, SciPy instead of hardcoded returns

**ISSUE 4: Mock Fallbacks Removed**
BEFORE: Line 243 showed generic mock with status: "mock_execution"
REQUIREMENT: Should raise NotImplementedError for unimplemented tools

ANALYSIS FORMAT:

For each issue, provide:
1. ‚úÖ RESOLVED or ‚ùå STILL PRESENT
2. Evidence: Specific line numbers and code excerpts
3. Assessment: Brief explanation of the implementation

Be specific and cite actual code from the files provided.
