Run `python external_tools/gemini-review-tool/gemini_review.py` with `--docs` pointing to each file you pass as $ARGUMENTS (or, if none, every `*.md` inside `docs/`), using `--config comprehensive-review.yaml`; then append any doc-vs-code mismatches to `CLAUDE.md` under `### Documentation Fixes Needed` and summarize the output of the gemini-review. Then update the CLAUDE.md to be optimized to implement solutions to all the issues described by the gemini-review. the CLAUDE.md should be detailed enough so that a new LLM with nothing other than the context in the LLM and the files it points to could successfully implement the fixes.
