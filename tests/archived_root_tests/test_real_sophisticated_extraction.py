    Detente between our two countries is central to world peace. The word "detente" can be 
    simplistically defined as "the easing of tension between nations." To be stable, detente 
    must be broadly defined and truly reciprocal. Both nations must exercise restraint.
    
    Neither of us should entertain the notion that military supremacy can be attained, or 
    that transient military advantage can be politically exploited. The numbers and 
    destructive potential of nuclear weapons has been increasing at an alarming rate.
    
    We will continue to maintain equivalent nuclear strength, because we believe that in 
    the absence of worldwide nuclear disarmament, such equivalency is the least threatening 
    and the most stable situation for the world. We will maintain a prudent and sustained 
    level of military spending, keyed to a stronger NATO.
    
    The Soviet Union apparently sees military power and military assistance as the best 
    means of expanding their influence abroad. To other nations throughout the world, the 
    Soviet military buildup appears to be excessive, far beyond any legitimate requirement 
    to defend themselves.
    
    I'm convinced that the people of the Soviet Union want peace. Our long-term objective 
    must be to convince the Soviet Union of the advantages of cooperation and of the costs 
    of disruptive behavior.
