This table provides a summary of Description Logic (DL) symbols used in OWL (Web Ontology Language) along with their Manchester syntax and semantics. Here's a terse but precise breakdown of key points with definitions for technical terms:

Foundational Symbols and Interpretations
Name	DL	Semantics
Domain of interpretation	ΔI\Delta^I	The total universe of discourse—the maximal set of "things" considered in the ontology.
Thing / Top concept	⊤\top	Represents everything in the domain: ⊤=ΔI\top = \Delta^I.
Nothing / Bottom concept	⊥\bot	Represents the empty set: ⊥=∅\bot = \emptyset.

Object and Data Properties (Roles)
Name	DL	Semantics
Top object property	UU	The universal binary relation: ΔI×ΔI\Delta^I \times \Delta^I (all ordered pairs of domain elements).
Bottom object property	BB	Empty relation: no ordered pairs.
Object property / Role	rr	A binary relation (a set of ordered pairs) between individuals (domain elements).
Data property	tt	Binary relation between individuals and data values (e.g., string, number).
	Technical term: Binary relation = a set of ordered pairs; e.g., likes = {(Alice, Bob), (Bob, Carol)}

Individuals and Concepts
Name	DL	Semantics
Individual	cc	c∈ΔIc \in \Delta^I: a specific entity in the domain.
Class / Concept	CC	C⊆ΔIC \subseteq \Delta^I: a subset of individuals (e.g., the class "Human").

Axioms (Logical Constraints)
Name	DL	Semantics
Concept subsumption	C⊑DC \sqsubseteq D	Class CC is a subclass (subset) of DD; all instances of CC are instances of DD.
Concept equivalence	C≡DC \equiv D	Classes CC and DD denote exactly the same set of individuals.
Role subsumption	r⊑sr \sqsubseteq s	Role rr is a subproperty of ss; every pair in rr is also in ss.

Assertional Axioms and Identity
DL Notation	Manchester	Semantics
r≡sr \equiv s	ObjectProperty r: EquivalentTo: s	Role equivalence: all pairs in relation rr are in ss and vice versa. Think: two identical relationships (e.g., "hasParent" ≡ "isChildOf⁻¹").
C(x)C(x)	Class: C; Individual: x; Type: C	Concept assertion: xx is an instance of class CC (i.e., the individual belongs to the group).
r(x,y)r(x, y)	ObjectProperty: r; Individual: x, y; Facts: r y	Role assertion: individual xx is related to individual yy via property rr.
x≈yx \approx y	SameAs	Identity: individuals xx and yy refer to the same entity.
x≉yx \not\approx y	DifferentFrom	Inequality: individuals xx and yy are not the same entity.

Concept Constructors
DL Notation	Manchester	Semantics
¬C\neg C	not C	Concept negation: everything not in CC.
C⊓DC \sqcap D	C and D	Intersection: things in both CC and DD.
C⊔DC \sqcup D	C or D	Union: things in CC, DD, or both.

Existential and Universal Restrictions
DL Notation	Manchester	Semantics
∃r.C\exists r.C	r some C	Qualified existential restriction: an individual is in this set if it has some relationship rr to at least one individual in class CC. (e.g., "Person who owns some Dog")
∃r\exists r or ∃r.⊤\exists r.\top	r some owl:Thing	Unqualified existential restriction: the individual has some relation rr to something, regardless of type.
∃r.{x}\exists r.\{x\}	r hasValue x	Value restriction: individual is related by rr specifically to xx. (e.g., "Person whose mother is Alice")
∀r.C\forall r.C	r only C	Qualified universal restriction: all rr-related individuals are in class CC. (e.g., "Person who only owns Dogs")





Distilled into first-order logic forms or illustrated with OWL/RDF syntax examples?

1. Concept Assertion — C(x)C(x)
Semantics: Individual xx is an instance of concept CC.
	• FOL: C(x)C(x)
	• OWL: ClassAssertion( :C :x )
	• Example: If C=HumanC = \text{Human}, x=Alicex = \text{Alice}, then:
ClassAssertion( :Human :Alice )

2. Role Assertion — r(x,y)r(x, y)
Semantics: Individual xx is related to yy via property rr.
	• FOL: r(x,y)r(x, y)
	• OWL: ObjectPropertyAssertion( :r :x :y )
	• Example: ObjectPropertyAssertion( :hasParent :Bob :Alice )

3. Same Individual — x≈yx \approx y
FOL: x=yx = y
OWL: SameIndividual( :x :y )

4. Different Individuals — x≉yx \not\approx y
FOL: x≠yx \neq y
OWL: DifferentIndividuals( :x :y )

5. Concept Negation — ¬C\neg C
FOL: ¬C(x)\neg C(x)
OWL: ComplementOf( :C )

6. Intersection — C⊓DC \sqcap D
FOL: C(x)∧D(x)C(x) \land D(x)
OWL: IntersectionOf( :C :D )
Example: Someone who is both Human and Student

7. Disjunction — C⊔DC \sqcup D
FOL: C(x)∨D(x)C(x) \lor D(x)
OWL: UnionOf( :C :D )

8. Existential Restriction — ∃r.C\exists r.C
FOL: ∃y (r(x,y)∧C(y))\exists y\ (r(x, y) \land C(y))
OWL: ObjectSomeValuesFrom( :r :C )
Example: Humans who own a dog:
SubClassOf( :Human ObjectSomeValuesFrom( :owns :Dog ) )

9. Unqualified Existential Restriction — ∃r\exists r or ∃r.⊤\exists r.\top
FOL: ∃y r(x,y)\exists y\ r(x, y)
OWL: ObjectSomeValuesFrom( :r owl:Thing )
Example: Anyone who owns something, anything:
ObjectSomeValuesFrom( :owns owl:Thing )

10. Value Restriction — ∃r.{x}\exists r.\{x\}
FOL: r(y,x)r(y, x)
OWL: ObjectHasValue( :r :x )
Example: Those who own Alice:
ObjectHasValue( :owns :Alice )

11. Universal Restriction — ∀r.C\forall r.C
FOL: ∀y (r(x,y)→C(y))\forall y\ (r(x, y) \rightarrow C(y))
OWL: ObjectAllValuesFrom( :r :C )
Example: All pets someone owns are dogs:
SubClassOf( :Person ObjectAllValuesFrom( :owns :Dog ) )
