Here's the validation of the `EntityIDManager` implementation against the specified requirements:

---

**1. Bidirectional ID mapping between Neo4j and SQLite**

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Mapping Storage:** The `create_id_mapping` method is responsible for persisting the relationship between an `internal_id` (generated by the manager) and a `neo4j_id` (generated by Neo4j). It inserts these into the `entity_mappings` SQLite table:
        ```python
        # In EntityIDManager.create_id_mapping
        await db.execute(
            """
            INSERT INTO entity_mappings (internal_id, neo4j_id, entity_type)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            """,
            [internal_id, neo4j_id, entity_type]
        )
        ```
    *   **Bidirectional Retrieval:**
        *   `get_neo4j_id(internal_id: str)`: This method queries the `entity_mappings` table using an `internal_id` to retrieve its corresponding `neo4j_id`.
            ```python
            # In EntityIDManager.get_neo4j_id
            cursor = await db.execute(
                "SELECT neo4j_id FROM entity_mappings WHERE internal_id = ?",
                [internal_id]
            )
            ```
        *   `get_internal_id(neo4j_id: str)`: Conversely, this method queries the same table using a `neo4j_id` to retrieve its `internal_id`.
            ```python
            # In EntityIDManager.get_internal_id
            cursor = await db.execute(
                "SELECT internal_id FROM entity_mappings WHERE neo4j_id = ?",
                [neo4j_id]
            )
            ```
    *   The implementation successfully establishes and maintains a bidirectional mapping, with clear methods for both storage and retrieval. An in-memory cache (`_id_cache`) further optimizes common lookups.

---

**2. Collision detection before ID assignment**

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The `generate_entity_id` method first generates a new UUID-based `internal_id`. Crucially, before returning this ID, it performs a check against the `entity_mappings` SQLite table to ensure the generated ID is not already in use:
        ```python
        # In EntityIDManager.generate_entity_id
        async with aiosqlite.connect(self.sqlite_path) as db:
            cursor = await db.execute(
                "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entity_mappings WHERE internal_id = ?",
                [entity_id]
            )
            count = await cursor.fetchone()
            
            # Extremely unlikely, but regenerate if collision
            if count[0] > 0:
                return await self.generate_entity_id(entity_type) # Recursive call
        ```
    *   While the probability of UUIDv4 collision is astronomically low, this explicit database check and the recursive regeneration mechanism ensure that the `internal_id` returned is guaranteed to be unique within the `entity_mappings` store at the time of generation. The `UNIQUE` constraint on the `internal_id` in the `entity_mappings` table (implied by the `IntegrityError` handling in `create_id_mapping`) provides a secondary, database-level guarantee during the actual mapping creation.

---

**3. Thread-safe concurrent ID generation**

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **ID Generation (`generate_entity_id`):** The initial generation of the `internal_id` using `uuid.uuid4()` is inherently thread-safe as it's a local, non-shared operation. The subsequent `SELECT COUNT(*)` check in SQLite is a read operation and does not typically cause race conditions that lead to data corruption. If two processes concurrently generate the same, extremely rare UUID, the database check would identify it.
    *   **ID Assignment/Mapping (`create_id_mapping`):** The most critical part for concurrency is the *assignment* or *persistence* of the ID mapping. This is protected by an `asyncio.Lock` (`self._lock`):
        ```python
        # In EntityIDManager.create_id_mapping
        async with self._lock: # <-- This lock ensures only one coroutine can modify mappings at a time
            async with aiosqlite.connect(self.sqlite_path) as db:
                try:
                    await db.execute(...) # INSERT operation
                    await db.commit()
                    # ...
                except aiosqlite.IntegrityError as e:
                    # ... (collision handling)
        ```
    *   This lock ensures that the `INSERT` operation into the `entity_mappings` table is serialized, preventing race conditions where multiple coroutines might attempt to write conflicting mappings simultaneously. Combined with the database's own unique constraints (which are handled in case of a collision, as detailed in Requirement 4), the process of assigning and persisting IDs is robustly thread-safe.

---

**4. Proper error handling for ID conflicts**

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The `create_id_mapping` method explicitly handles conflicts that arise from attempting to create a mapping where either the `internal_id` or `neo4j_id` (or both) already exist, which would violate unique constraints in the `entity_mappings` table. It catches `aiosqlite.IntegrityError`:
        ```python
        # In EntityIDManager.create_id_mapping
        except aiosqlite.IntegrityError as e:
            if "UNIQUE constraint failed" in str(e):
                raise ValueError(f"ID mapping already exists: {e}") # <-- Specific conflict error
            raise # Re-raise other IntegrityErrors
        ```
    *   By checking for `"UNIQUE constraint failed"` within the error message, the manager can specifically identify and re-raise a `ValueError`, clearly indicating that an ID conflict occurred during mapping creation. This provides a clear and actionable error for the caller to handle.
    *   For the `generate_entity_id` method, as noted previously, potential internal collisions (though highly unlikely) are handled by regeneration and do not propagate as errors to the caller, which is the desired behavior for an ID generation utility.
