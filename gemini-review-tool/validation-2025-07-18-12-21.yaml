  For each claim, provide verdict with specific line number references:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Implementation complete with all requirements met
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Implementation exists but missing some requirements
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Implementation missing, non-functional, or still contains placeholders
  
  CRITICAL: Reference specific line numbers and code sections for each claim analysis.
