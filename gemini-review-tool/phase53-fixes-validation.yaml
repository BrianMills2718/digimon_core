claims_of_success: |
  CLAIM 1: Fixed Async Migration - Removed all simulation code and implemented real async operations
  - LOCATION: src/core/neo4j_manager.py (real async Neo4j connection), src/core/tool_factory.py (real concurrent tool auditing)
  - EXPECTED: No asyncio.sleep() simulation, real async operations using proper APIs
  - VALIDATION: Performance improvement from real async operations, not simulation timing

  CLAIM 2: Fixed ConfidenceScore Integration - Replaced all placeholder tools with real implementations
  - LOCATION: src/tools/phase1/t27_relationship_extractor.py, t31_entity_builder.py, t68_pagerank_optimized.py, src/tools/phase2/t23c_ontology_aware_extractor.py
  - EXPECTED: Real entity/relationship/aggregation logic with evidence weights and metadata
  - VALIDATION: No placeholder or dummy logic, full ConfidenceScore usage with add_evidence()

  CLAIM 3: Fixed Unit Testing - Replaced heavy mocking with real functionality testing
  - LOCATION: tests/unit/test_async_multi_document_processor.py, test_security_manager.py
  - EXPECTED: Real async processing, memory management, and security validation with minimal external mocking
  - VALIDATION: Tests measure actual performance, memory usage, and cryptographic operations

  CLAIM 4: Fixed Academic Pipeline - Implemented true end-to-end workflow integration
  - LOCATION: tests/integration/test_academic_pipeline_simple.py
  - EXPECTED: Chained data flow from PDF→Text→Entities→Export with real data passing between steps
  - VALIDATION: 15+ entities extracted, LaTeX/BibTeX contain real data, complete workflow under 60s

custom_prompt: |
  Please validate that Phase 5.3 implementation issues have been fully resolved.
  
  **VALIDATION OBJECTIVE**: Verify all 4 critical issues identified in previous Gemini review are fixed.
  
  **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**: Each claim must demonstrate:
  1. **No Simulation Code**: Async methods use real operations, not asyncio.sleep() placeholders
  2. **No Placeholder Logic**: Tools implement real functionality, not dummy returns
  3. **Minimal Mocking**: Tests use real functionality, minimal external dependency mocking
  4. **End-to-End Integration**: Pipeline chains real data flow, no isolated component tests
  
  For each claim, verify:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Issue completely fixed with real implementation
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Some improvement but still has issues
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Issue remains unaddressed
  
  **EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS**:
  - Code inspection for removal of simulation/placeholder patterns
  - Real async operations using proper APIs (not sleep() delays)
  - ConfidenceScore usage with evidence weights and metadata
  - Test methods using real functionality (not heavy mocking)
  - Academic pipeline chaining real tool outputs (not hardcoded data)
  
  Focus on evidence-based validation. If code shows real implementations replacing placeholders/simulations, mark as FULLY RESOLVED. If still contains simulation/placeholder patterns, mark as NOT RESOLVED.
