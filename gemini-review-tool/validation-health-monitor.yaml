  Validate Health Monitoring System:
  
  REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Individual service health check methods
  2. System-wide health aggregation and scoring
  3. Resource metrics (CPU, memory, disk) collection
  4. Degradation detection with configurable thresholds
  5. Real-time health status endpoints
  
  FOCUS: Health check methods, metrics collection, and status determination
