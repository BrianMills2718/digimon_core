  Validate Performance Baseline System:
  
  REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Track execution times for all tool operations
  2. Define SLA thresholds for operation types
  3. Compare real-time performance against baselines
  4. Alert when performance degrades below thresholds
  5. Historical performance data storage
  
  FOCUS: Timing collection, SLA definition, and alert triggering
  
  EVIDENCE: Show timing logic, SLA checks, and alert mechanisms
