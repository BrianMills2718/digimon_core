  Please validate the implementation claims for the Deep Integration Framework by analyzing the specific code implementations.
  
  ## VALIDATION CLAIMS TO VERIFY:
  
  ### CLAIM 1: Dynamic Meta-Schema Execution Engine 
  **Location**: deep_integration_scenario.py lines 50-124
  **Claim**: Successfully extracts validation rules from theory schema JSON and executes them dynamically at runtime
  **Expected**: MetaSchemaExecutionEngine class with execute_validation_rule() method that parses conditional logic from JSON
  **Test Result Claimed**: 100% execution success rate, 45 rule evaluations across 3 scenarios
  
  ### CLAIM 2: MCL Concept Mediation System
  **Location**: deep_integration_scenario.py lines 126-237  
  **Claim**: Automatically resolves indigenous terms to canonical concepts with confidence scoring and DOLCE ontology integration
  **Expected**: MCLConceptMediator class with resolve_indigenous_term() method and concept mapping database
  **Test Result Claimed**: 92% high-confidence resolutions, 100% resolution success rate
  
  ### CLAIM 3: Cross-Modal Semantic Preservation
  **Location**: deep_integration_scenario.py lines 239-471
  **Claim**: Tests semantic preservation through graph→table→vector→graph round-trip transformations
  **Expected**: CrossModalSemanticValidator class with validate_round_trip_integrity() and semantic preservation scoring
  **Test Result Claimed**: 40% preservation score (partial success, information loss identified)
  
  ### CLAIM 4: Tool Contract Validation System
  **Location**: deep_integration_scenario.py lines 473-596
  **Claim**: Validates tool compatibility and automatic transformations between incompatible data types
  **Expected**: ToolContractValidator class with validate_io_compatibility() and execute_transformation() methods
  **Test Result Claimed**: 100% compatibility rate for tested contracts
  
  ### CLAIM 5: Statistical Robustness Testing
  **Location**: deep_integration_scenario.py lines 598-735
  **Claim**: Tests statistical properties preservation through integration pipeline with confidence intervals and noise robustness
  **Expected**: StatisticalIntegrationValidator class with compute_confidence_intervals() and test_robustness_under_noise() methods
  **Test Result Claimed**: 99% robustness score, statistical validation working
  
  ## VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
  
  For each claim, verify:
  1. **Implementation Present**: Does the claimed class and methods exist at specified locations?
  2. **Functionality Complete**: Is the implementation fully functional (not stub/placeholder)?
  3. **Test Results Valid**: Do the test results in deep_integration_results_1753150369.json match the claimed functionality?
  4. **Integration Working**: Does the DeepIntegrationScenario class successfully orchestrate all components?
  
  ## SPECIFIC VALIDATION POINTS:
  
  - Confirm MetaSchemaExecutionEngine._evaluate_condition() can parse and execute conditional logic
  - Verify MCLConceptMediator.concept_mappings contains the political/stakeholder term mappings mentioned
  - Check CrossModalSemanticValidator implements all 4 transformation steps (graph→table→vector→graph)
  - Confirm ToolContractValidator._check_type_compatibility() handles inheritance and transformation detection
  - Verify StatisticalIntegrationValidator imports statistics module and computes actual confidence intervals
  
  Please analyze each implementation and provide a verdict for each claim:
  - ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED** - Implementation present, complete, meets requirements
  - ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - Implementation present but incomplete or doesn't fully meet requirements  
  - ❌ **NOT RESOLVED** - Implementation missing or doesn't address the claimed issue
