prompt: |
  Critically analyze the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the KGAS system:
  
  **1. DECISION QUALITY**
  - Are the decisions well-motivated with clear problem statements?
  - Do the chosen solutions adequately address the stated problems?
  - Are alternatives properly considered and evaluated?
  - Is the rationale for choosing specific solutions compelling?
  
  **2. TECHNICAL SOUNDNESS**
  - Are the technical approaches industry best practices?
  - Do the decisions show deep understanding of the problem domain?
  - Are there any decisions that seem technically questionable?
  - How well do decisions handle edge cases and failure modes?
  
  **3. CONSISTENCY AND INTEGRATION**
  - Do the various ADRs form a coherent whole?
  - Are there conflicting decisions between different ADRs?
  - How well do decisions integrate with each other?
  - Are dependencies between decisions properly managed?
  
  **4. RISK ASSESSMENT**
  - Are the risks of each decision properly identified?
  - Do the ADRs acknowledge potential negative consequences?
  - Are mitigation strategies adequate?
  - What are the biggest risks in the current decisions?
  
  **5. IMPLEMENTATION PRACTICALITY**
  - Are the decisions realistic to implement?
  - Do they consider development effort and complexity?
  - Are there decisions that might be over-engineered?
  - How actionable are the decisions for developers?
  
  For each ADR, provide:
  - A brief assessment of its quality (Good/Adequate/Poor)
  - The most significant strength
  - The most critical weakness
  - Suggested improvements
  
  Overall assessment: Which decisions pose the greatest risk to project success?

analysis_focus:
  - Problem-solution fit
  - Technical depth and accuracy
  - Consideration of alternatives
  - Risk identification and mitigation
  - Implementation guidance clarity

red_flags:
  - Decisions without clear problems
  - Missing alternative considerations
  - Overly complex solutions
  - Ignored failure modes
  - Contradictory decisions
