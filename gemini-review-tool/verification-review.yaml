custom_prompt: |
  Please validate the specific claims of MVRT tool repair success by carefully reviewing the provided files.
  
  **CONTEXT**: MVRT tool repair implementation has been completed. Need to validate that all 6 claims of success are legitimate.
  
  FOCUS ON VALIDATING THESE 6 CLAIMS:
  1. Version conflict resolution - verify archived/ directory and conflict resolution logs
  2. Missing tool classes - verify class implementations with execute methods
  3. Neo4j connection handling - verify graceful degradation implementation
  4. Validation testing support - verify validation mode implementations
  5. Tool validator updates - verify improved testing methodology
  6. Overall functionality rate - verify >90% success rate from validation output
  
  VALIDATION CRITERIA - Each claim must be validated with:
  - Actual code inspection showing the claimed changes
  - Evidence of successful execution with real timestamps
  - Verification that fixes address the specific problems mentioned
  - Confirmation that validation testing confirms functionality
  - Assessment of overall MVRT completion percentage
  
  Please provide verdicts for each claim as ✅ (validated), ⚠️ (partially validated), or ❌ (not validated).
  
  PRIORITY ANALYSIS: Focus validation on:
  - Evidence.md showing 92.9% functional rate with real timestamp
  - Tool files showing actual validation mode implementations
  - archived/tools/ directory showing conflict resolution
  - validate_tool_inventory.py showing improved validation logic
  - Evidence required: Architecture documentation is complete and separated from implementation status
  
  **TOOL_REGISTRY_VALIDATION**: Verify tool registry accurately reflects current state
  - Must verify: src/core/tool_registry.py contains accurate tool status based on Evidence.md
  - Must verify: Tool registry identifies specific issues for each broken tool
  - Must verify: Version conflicts are properly documented and resolution strategy exists
  - Must verify: Registry provides clear breakdown of functional vs broken tools
  - Evidence required: Tool registry matches actual validation results, not inflated claims
  
  **ROADMAP_CONSOLIDATION**: Verify consolidated roadmap with evidence-based status
  - Must verify: docs/planning/roadmap_overview.md shows honest current status (78.6% functionality)
  - Must verify: MVRT implementation status reflects actual tool validation results
  - Must verify: Post-MVRT planning preserves historical roadmap content
  - Must verify: Status claims are backed by Evidence.md rather than assumptions
  - Evidence required: Roadmap status is realistic and evidence-based
  
  **IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS**: Validate CLAUDE.md fix instructions for remaining 9 broken tools
  - Must verify: CLAUDE.md contains specific implementation tasks to fix tool parameter validation
  - Must verify: Coding philosophy mandates no lazy implementations and fail-fast approach
  - Must verify: Evidence-based development requirements with real timestamps
  - Must verify: Gemini validation setup for iterative improvement
  - Evidence required: Implementation instructions are specific enough for autonomous execution
  
  **BROKEN_TOOLS_ANALYSIS**: Analyze the 3 broken tools and proposed fixes
  - T23c (OntologyAwareExtractor): "input_data is required" - needs parameter validation fix
  - T41 (AsyncTextEmbedder): Returns coroutine - needs async handling fix
  - T301 (MultiDocumentFusion): Missing execute method - needs class/method implementation
  - Evidence required: Each tool's specific issue is identified with clear fix approach
  
  **CRITICAL_VALIDATION_REQUIREMENTS**:
  1. Is the current status assessment honest (78.6% not inflated claims)?
  2. Are the broken tool error patterns genuine (not hidden behind mocks)?
  3. Are Evidence.md timestamps authentic (2025-07-19T08:26:44.412008)?
  4. Do implementation instructions follow fail-fast philosophy?
  5. Is the fix approach systematic and evidence-based?
  
  For each area, provide verdict:
  - ✅ PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED: Complete and meets requirements with evidence
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY CORRECT: Some implementation but missing requirements
  - ❌ INCORRECT/MISSING: Implementation missing, inflated, or mocked
  
  Reference specific line numbers and evidence sources in your analysis.
  Validate whether the proposed fix approach will realistically achieve >90% tool functionality.
