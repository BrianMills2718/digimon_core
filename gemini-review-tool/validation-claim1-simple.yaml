  Check these 4 specific requirements:
  
  1. Line 73: AuditEntry class must have @dataclass(frozen=True) decorator
  2. Line 83-93: Hash calculation must include previous_hash for chaining
  3. Line 118-132: verify_integrity() method must check chain continuity
  4. Line 164: _audit_trails must be typed as Dict[str, ImmutableAuditTrail]
  
  VERDICT:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED if all 4 requirements are met
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED if some requirements are met
