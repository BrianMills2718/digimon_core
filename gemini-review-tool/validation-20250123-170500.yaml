project_name: "Phase RELIABILITY Implementation Validation"

include_patterns:
  - "src/core/provenance_manager.py"
  - "src/monitoring/performance_tracker.py"
  - "src/core/sla_monitor.py"

custom_prompt: |
  Validate the Phase RELIABILITY implementation claims for KGAS. For each claimed fix, verify:
  
  1. The implementation is present in the specified file
  2. The implementation is complete (not a stub or placeholder)
  3. The implementation addresses the specific issue mentioned
  
  Focus ONLY on these three critical fixes:
  - Audit Trail Immutability in ProvenanceManager
  - Performance Tracker implementation
  - SLA Monitor implementation

claims_of_success:
  - claim: "Audit trails use cryptographic chaining preventing tampering"
    evidence: "ImmutableAuditTrail class with SHA256 hash chains in provenance_manager.py"
    files: ["src/core/provenance_manager.py"]
    
  - claim: "Performance tracking captures all operation timings with baseline establishment"
    evidence: "PerformanceTracker class with automatic baseline calculation in performance_tracker.py"
    files: ["src/monitoring/performance_tracker.py"]
    
  - claim: "SLA monitoring detects and alerts on violations"
    evidence: "SLAMonitor class with configurable thresholds and alert handlers in sla_monitor.py"
    files: ["src/core/sla_monitor.py"]
