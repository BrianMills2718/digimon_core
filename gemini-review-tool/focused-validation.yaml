  VALIDATION OBJECTIVE: Verify the Mitchell-Agle-Wood salience calculator implementation.

  SPECIFIC CLAIMS TO VALIDATE:

  **MITCHELL-AGLE-WOOD SALIENCE CALCULATOR** (salience_calculator.py):
  - Geometric mean calculation implementation: (legitimacy × urgency × power)^(1/3)
  - Edge case handling for zero inputs, boundary values, and floating point precision
  - Comprehensive test cases with 100% success rate achievement
  - Mitchell stakeholder categorization (definitive, dependent, dominant, etc.)
  - Input validation and error handling

  VALIDATION CRITERIA:
  - **Implementation Present**: Does the geometric mean calculation exist?
  - **Functionality Complete**: Is it fully implemented with edge case handling?
  - **Requirements Met**: Does it satisfy mathematical and technical requirements?
  - **Test Coverage**: Are comprehensive test cases implemented?

  Please analyze the code and provide verdict:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Complete implementation with evidence
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Implementation present but with limitations  
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Missing or incomplete implementation

  Focus on specific line numbers and code evidence.
