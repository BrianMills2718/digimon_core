**OBJECTIVE**: Analyze the KGAS architecture design quality now that implementation status documents have been removed.

**CONTEXT**: This is a clean analysis of PURE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN documents. All implementation status, progress reports, and point-in-time documents have been archived. We are analyzing only:
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- System design specifications
- Architectural concepts and patterns
- Data architecture designs
- Component specifications

**ANALYSIS CRITERIA**:

1. **Architectural Coherence** (1-10):
   - Do the ADRs form a coherent architectural vision?
   - Are design decisions well-reasoned with proper trade-off analysis?
   - Do components integrate logically?

2. **Design Completeness** (1-10):
   - Are interfaces and contracts well-specified?
   - Is the data architecture clearly defined?
   - Are service boundaries and interactions clear?

3. **Academic Research Alignment** (1-10):
   - Does the architecture serve academic research requirements?
   - Are uncertainty quantification and error handling appropriate for research?
   - Does the design support reproducibility and transparency?

4. **Technical Sophistication** (1-10):
   - Are advanced concepts (cross-modal analysis, uncertainty propagation) well-designed?
   - Do the architectural patterns demonstrate good engineering practices?
   - Is the system designed for extensibility and maintainability?

5. **Documentation Quality** (1-10):
   - Are architectural decisions well-documented with rationale?
   - Do the concepts documents provide clear guidance for implementers?
   - Is the documentation comprehensive without being overwhelming?

**KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS TO EVALUATE**:
- ADR-001: Contract-first tool interface design
- ADR-009: Bi-store database strategy (Neo4j + SQLite)
- ADR-007: CERQual-based uncertainty quantification
- ADR-014: Fail-fast error handling strategy
- ADR-011: Academic research focus over enterprise scalability
- Cross-modal analysis architecture (graph/table/vector)
- Service-oriented architecture with core services

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **Overall Architecture Score (1-10)**: Based on design quality, not implementation
2. **Detailed Analysis**: For each of the 5 criteria above
3. **Architectural Strengths**: What's well-designed and innovative
4. **Design Gaps**: Missing specifications or unclear architectural decisions
5. **Academic Research Fit**: How well the architecture serves its intended academic research domain

**IGNORE**:
- Implementation status or progress
- Current development phases
- Tool completion percentages
- Any timeline or milestone information

**FOCUS ON**:
- Design quality and coherence
- Architectural innovation
- Academic research appropriateness
- Technical soundness of decisions
