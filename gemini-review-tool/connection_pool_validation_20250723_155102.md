The Connection Pool Manager in `src/core/connection_pool_manager.py` demonstrates a well-thought-out design for managing database connections asynchronously.

Here's a validation against the given requirements:

---

### Requirement 1: Dynamic pool sizing between min and max limits

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Initialization:** The `__init__` method accepts `min_size` and `max_size` parameters. The `_initialize_pool` method ensures that the pool starts with `min_size` connections.
        ```python
        # __init__
        def __init__(self, min_size: int = 5, max_size: int = 20, ...):
            self.min_size = min_size
            self.max_size = max_size
            # ...
            asyncio.create_task(self._initialize_pool())

        # _initialize_pool
        for _ in range(self.min_size):
            tasks.append(self._create_connection())
        ```
    *   **Expansion:** When `acquire_connection` is called and no connections are available in the queue, it attempts to create a new connection, but only if `len(self._pool) < self.max_size`.
        ```python
        # _acquire_connection (inside the while True loop, when queue is empty)
        async with self._lock:
            if len(self._pool) < self.max_size: # Check against max_size
                conn = await self._create_connection()
                self._pool.append(conn)
                conn.state = ConnectionState.ACTIVE
                conn.use_count += 1
                return conn
        ```
    *   **Contraction/Maintenance:**
        *   The `_maintenance_loop` periodically removes `IDLE` connections that haven't been used for 5 minutes, helping to reduce the pool size if demand drops (though it doesn't explicitly check `min_size` during removal, the `_ensure_minimum_connections` then brings it back up if needed).
        *   The `health_check_all` and `_acquire_connection` methods destroy unhealthy connections, effectively shrinking the pool, but `_ensure_minimum_connections` is called afterwards to maintain the `min_size`.
        *   The `_ensure_minimum_connections` method explicitly adds connections if `current_count < self.min_size`.
        ```python
        # _maintenance_loop
        if (conn.state == ConnectionState.IDLE and now - conn.last_used > timedelta(minutes=5)):
            await self._destroy_connection(conn)
            self._pool.remove(conn)
        await self._ensure_minimum_connections() # Called after maintenance

        # health_check_all
        if conn.health_check_failures >= 3:
            await self._destroy_connection(conn)
            self._pool.remove(conn)
        await self._ensure_minimum_connections() # Ensures min size after removals
        ```
    *   **Dynamic Resizing Method:** The `resize_pool` method allows for runtime adjustment of `min_size` and `max_size`. It also explicitly removes excess connections if the pool currently exceeds the new `max_size`.
        ```python
        # resize_pool
        if len(self._pool) > self.max_size:
            excess = len(self._pool) - self.max_size
            for _ in range(excess):
                # ... remove connections
        await self._ensure_minimum_connections()
        ```

---

### Requirement 2: Automatic health checks removing unhealthy connections

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Health Check Logic:** `PooledConnection.is_healthy()` checks the `state` and `health_check_failures` count. `_check_connection_health` performs actual database operations (e.g., `RETURN 1` for Neo4j, `SELECT 1` for SQLite) to verify connectivity.
        ```python
        # PooledConnection
        def is_healthy(self) -> bool:
            return self.state != ConnectionState.UNHEALTHY and self.health_check_failures < 3

        # _check_connection_health
        try:
            # ... perform DB specific health check query
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Health check failed for connection {conn.id}: {e}")
            self._stats['health_check_failures'] += 1
            return False
        ```
    *   **Automatic Removal:**
        *   **During Acquisition:** If `_acquire_connection` pulls an `UNHEALTHY` connection from the `_available` queue, it immediately destroys it and attempts to get another or create a new one.
            ```python
            # _acquire_connection (inside the while True loop)
            if conn.is_healthy():
                # ... return connection
            else:
                # Unhealthy connection, destroy it
                await self._destroy_connection(conn)
            ```
        *   **Periodic Check:** The `_health_check_loop` runs `health_check_all` every 30 seconds. `health_check_all` iterates through all connections in the pool. If `_check_connection_health` fails for a connection, its `health_check_failures` count is incremented. If this count reaches 3, the connection is destroyed (`_destroy_connection`) and removed from `_pool`.
            ```python
            # _health_check_loop
            await asyncio.sleep(30)
            await self.health_check_all()

            # health_check_all
            if await self._check_connection_health(conn):
                healthy_count += 1
            else:
                conn.health_check_failures += 1
                if conn.health_check_failures >= 3: # Threshold for removal
                    await self._destroy_connection(conn)
                    self._pool.remove(conn)
            ```
    *   **Recovery:** After removing unhealthy connections, `health_check_all` calls `_ensure_minimum_connections` to replenish the pool if it falls below `min_size`.

---

### Requirement 3: Graceful exhaustion handling with request queuing

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Request Queuing:** The `_available: asyncio.Queue` serves as the primary mechanism for managing available connections. When `acquire_connection` is called, it ultimately calls `_acquire_connection`.
    *   **Handling Exhaustion:**
        *   If `_available.get_nowait()` fails (i.e., the queue is empty), the code checks if the pool size is below `max_size`. If so, a new connection is created immediately.
        *   If the pool is already at `max_size` and the `_available` queue is empty, instead of raising an error, the `_acquire_connection` method enters a loop that `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` (a small delay) and then retries to get a connection from the queue or create a new one. This effectively makes subsequent `acquire_connection` calls wait (queue) until a connection becomes available (either through release or creation by another `acquire_connection` call that was allowed to create).
            ```python
            # _acquire_connection
            try:
                # ... get_nowait()
            except asyncio.QueueEmpty: # No available connections
                async with self._lock:
                    if len(self._pool) < self.max_size: # Create if below max
                        # ... create new connection
                # Need to wait for a connection
                await asyncio.sleep(0.1) # This introduces the "queuing" or waiting behavior
            ```
    *   While not a strict `asyncio.Queue` for *requests*, the `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` effectively causes `acquire_connection` calls to yield and retry until a connection is available, simulating a waiting queue for acquisition requests. This prevents immediate failure and allows for graceful handling under high load.

---

### Requirement 4: Timeout support for connection acquisition

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The `acquire_connection` method takes an optional `timeout` parameter (defaulting to 30.0 seconds).
    *   It uses `asyncio.wait_for` to enforce this timeout on the `_acquire_connection` call.
    *   If the timeout is exceeded, `asyncio.TimeoutError` is raised, and a warning is logged.
        ```python
        # acquire_connection
        async def acquire_connection(self, timeout: Optional[float] = 30.0) -> Any:
            # ...
            try:
                if timeout:
                    conn = await asyncio.wait_for(
                        self._acquire_connection(),
                        timeout=timeout
                    )
                else:
                    conn = await self._acquire_connection()
                # ...
            except asyncio.TimeoutError:
                logger.warning(f"Connection acquisition timed out after {timeout}s")
                raise
        ```

---

### Requirement 5: Proper connection lifecycle (acquire/release)

*   **Verdict:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Creation:** `_create_connection` is responsible for establishing the underlying database connection (Neo4j session or aiosqlite connection) and wrapping it in a `PooledConnection` object. It sets `created_at` and `last_used` timestamps.
        ```python
        # _create_connection
        pooled_conn = PooledConnection(id=conn_id, connection=connection, state=ConnectionState.IDLE)
        ```
    *   **Acquisition:** `_acquire_connection` retrieves an `IDLE` connection, changes its state to `ACTIVE`, updates `last_used`, increments `use_count`, and then returns the raw connection object to the caller.
        ```python
        # _acquire_connection (when a healthy conn is found)
        conn.state = ConnectionState.ACTIVE
        conn.last_used = datetime.now()
        conn.use_count += 1
        return conn
        ```
    *   **Release:** `release_connection` takes the raw connection object, finds its `PooledConnection` wrapper, changes its state back to `IDLE`, updates `last_used`, and puts it back into the `_available` queue.
        ```python
        # release_connection
        if conn.state == ConnectionState.ACTIVE:
            conn.state = ConnectionState.IDLE
            conn.last_used = datetime.now()
            await self._available.put(conn)
        ```
    *   **Destruction:** `_destroy_connection` explicitly closes the underlying database connection (e.g., `driver.session().close()` for Neo4j, `conn.connection.close()` for SQLite), sets the state to `CLOSED`, and increments `connection_destroys` stat. This method is called when connections are unhealthy, during maintenance for idle connections, or during `shutdown`.
        ```python
        # _destroy_connection
        conn.state = ConnectionState.CLOSED
        if self.connection_type == "neo4j":
            await conn.connection.close() # Actually close driver/session
        elif self.connection_type == "sqlite":
            await conn.connection.close() # Actually close connection
        ```
    *   **Graceful Shutdown:** The `shutdown` method cancels background tasks, waits for all active connections to be released (up to a timeout), and then destroys all remaining connections in the pool.
        ```python
        # shutdown
        # ... wait for active_count == 0
        async with self._lock:
            for conn in self._pool:
                await self._destroy_connection(conn)
            self._pool.clear()
        ```
    *   The use of `PooledConnection` dataclass to wrap the raw connection object allows for tracking state, usage, and health, ensuring proper management throughout its lifecycle within the pool.
