  PHASE 1 TOOLS IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION
  
  **OBJECTIVE**: Verify that T27, T31, and T34 tools have been properly implemented with unified BaseTool interface compliance and mock-free testing.
  
  **VALIDATION CRITERIA FOR EACH CLAIM**:
  
  1. **Unified BaseTool Interface Compliance**:
     - Each tool class inherits from BaseTool (imported from src.tools.base_tool)
     - Implements required execute(self, request: ToolRequest) -> ToolResult method
     - Implements required get_contract(self) method returning tool contract
     - Uses unified error handling with ToolErrorCode enum
     - Uses _start_execution() and _end_execution() for performance tracking
  
  2. **Real Library Integration (Not Mocked)**:
     - T27: Uses real spaCy nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") for dependency parsing
     - T31/T34: Uses real Neo4j GraphDatabase.driver() initialization
     - All tools: Use real ServiceManager instances for service integration
  
  3. **Mock-Free Testing Implementation**:
     - Test classes named with "MockFree" suffix
     - setup_method() uses self.service_manager = ServiceManager() (real instance)
     - NO imports from unittest.mock (no Mock, patch, MagicMock)
     - test_zero_mocking_verification() method confirms no mocking is used
     - Tests use real functionality and libraries, not simulations
  
  4. **Production-Ready Implementation Quality**:
     - Comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
     - Proper input validation using _validate_input() methods
     - Performance monitoring with execution_time and memory_used tracking
     - Complete contract specifications with input/output schemas
  
  **REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT**:
  For each claim, provide:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Implementation found at [specific line numbers], meets all requirements
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Implementation found but incomplete/missing elements  
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Implementation missing or still uses mocking patterns
  
  **FOCUS AREAS**:
  - Reference specific line numbers where implementations are found
  - Quote actual code snippets that demonstrate real functionality
  - Identify any remaining mock patterns if found
  - Verify unified interface compliance with BaseTool pattern
