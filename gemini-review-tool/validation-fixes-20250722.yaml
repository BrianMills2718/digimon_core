# Custom validation prompt focused on the fixes
custom_prompt: |
  You are validating specific FIXES to issues identified in a previous Gemini validation.
  
  PREVIOUS CRITICAL ISSUES:
  1. T11 PowerPoint Loader test suite was completely missing
  2. Error handling used string prefixes instead of formal programmatic error codes
  
  FIXES TO VALIDATE:
  1. test_t11_powerpoint_loader_unified.py - Should now exist with comprehensive mock-free tests
  2. ToolErrorCode enum in base_tool.py - Should provide formal error codes for programmatic handling
  
  For each fix, determine:
  - FULLY RESOLVED: Fix implemented completely and correctly
  - PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Fix implemented but incomplete or has issues
  - NOT RESOLVED: Fix missing or incorrect
  
  Provide specific line numbers and evidence for each assessment.
