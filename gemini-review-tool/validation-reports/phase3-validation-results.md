The provided input lacks the actual codebase content. The `CODEBASE:` section is empty, and no file contents are supplied.

Therefore, I cannot critically evaluate the codebase against the given claims. To perform the evaluation, the content of the specified files (`src/tools/phase3/t301_multi_document_fusion.py`, `src/tools/phase2/t23c_ontology_aware_extractor.py`, `src/tools/phase3/basic_multi_document_workflow.py`, `validate_phase3.py`, `phase3_validation_results.json`) must be included in the `CODEBASE:` section.

Without the code, any assessment would be purely speculative and based on assumptions, which goes against the instruction to "analyze ONLY the included files and verify each claim individually."

Please provide the actual codebase files for a thorough analysis.
