It appears that the `files` section of the provided input, which should contain the codebase and the stress test report (`stress_test_2025.07211755/results/stress_test_report_1753146572.md`), is empty.

Without the actual content of the codebase and the stress test report, I am unable to perform the requested analysis.

To provide a comprehensive review, please provide the complete file contents in the `<files>` section. Once the content is available, I will be able to analyze:

1.  **Architecture Overview**: High-level assessment of the system design.
2.  **Code Quality**: Identify issues with code structure, patterns, and best practices.
3.  **Security Concerns**: Point out potential security vulnerabilities.
4.  **Performance Issues**: Identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
5.  **Technical Debt**: Areas that need refactoring or improvement.
6.  **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable guidance for improvement.

And specifically for the stress test report:
1.  **100% success rate**: Verify if all tests passed successfully.
2.  **All 4 test components listed as passed**: Check for explicit pass status for each component.
3.  **Real execution time and metrics**: Look for detailed timing and performance metrics.

Please re-send the input with the file contents included.
