The provided codebase is currently empty. The `<files>` section, which should contain the content of the repository's files, is blank.

Therefore, I cannot perform the requested analysis for the following reasons:

1.  **Architecture Overview**: I cannot assess the system design without any code or documentation to review.
2.  **Code Quality**: I cannot identify issues with code structure, patterns, or best practices without any code to inspect.
3.  **Security Concerns**: I cannot point out potential security vulnerabilities without any code to analyze for common attack vectors or misconfigurations.
4.  **Performance Issues**: I cannot identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies without any code to profile or analyze for algorithmic complexity.
5.  **Technical Debt**: I cannot suggest areas for refactoring or improvement without any existing code to evaluate.
6.  **Recommendations**: Meaningful, actionable guidance cannot be provided without a codebase to base them on.

### Claim Validation (Claims 5 & 6)

I am also unable to validate **CLAIM 5** and **CLAIM 6** because the `roadmap.md` file, which is explicitly mentioned as the target for these verifications, is not present in the provided codebase.

Therefore, for both claims:

**CLAIM 5: Scalability Terms Removed**
*   **Verification status**: ❌ NOT RESOLVED (Cannot verify due to missing file)
*   **Specific line references**: N/A
*   **Direct quotes**: N/A

**CLAIM 6: SSoT Authority Structure Clear**
*   **Verification status**: ❌ NOT RESOLVED (Cannot verify due to missing file)
*   **Specific line references**: N/A
*   **Direct quotes**: N/A

Please provide the actual content of the codebase files, especially `docs/planning/roadmap.md`, for me to perform the requested analysis and claim validations. Once the content is available, I will be able to provide a comprehensive review and specific recommendations.
