It appears that the `CODEBASE` section provided is a template generated by Repomix, but it does not contain any actual file content within the `<files>` section. Specifically, the file path `stress_test_2025.07211755/results/stress_test_report_1753146572.md` is mentioned as being included, but its content is not present.

Without the actual codebase files and, critically, the content of the `stress_test_report_1753146572.md` file, I am unable to perform the requested analysis.

To provide a comprehensive review, please provide the full content of the files, especially the `stress_test_report_1753146572.md`, within the `<files>` section of the Repomix output.

Once the content is provided, I will be able to analyze:

1.  **Architecture Overview**: High-level assessment of the system design.
2.  **Code Quality**: Issues with code structure, patterns, and best practices.
3.  **Security Concerns**: Potential security vulnerabilities.
4.  **Performance Issues**: Potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
5.  **Technical Debt**: Areas that need refactoring or improvement.
6.  **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable guidance for improvement.

And specifically for the stress test report:

1.  Verify 100% success rate.
2.  Verify all 4 test components are listed as passed.
3.  Verify real execution time and metrics are shown.

Please ensure the file content is included in your next prompt.
