project_name: "Meta-Schema Framework Consistency Check"

include_patterns:
  - "docs/architecture/data/theory-meta-schema-v10.md"
  - "docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md"

custom_prompt: |
  Validate ONLY meta-schema framework consistency between these two architecture files:

  **SPECIFIC CONSISTENCY CHECKS**:
  1. **eval() Security Warnings**: Are security warnings about eval() usage consistent between files?
  2. **Rule Execution Claims**: Are claims about "100% rule execution success" and "45 rule evaluations" consistent?
  3. **Implementation Status**: Are claims about "OPERATIONAL" and "FUNCTIONAL" status consistent?
  4. **Validation Evidence**: Are references to validation evidence files consistent?

  **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**:
  - Quote specific security warnings about eval() 
  - Verify quantified metrics match (100%, 45 evaluations)
  - Check implementation status consistency
  - Verify evidence file references

  **IGNORE**: Everything not related to meta-schema framework consistency

  **OUTPUT FORMAT**:
  - ✅ CONSISTENT: [specific evidence with quotes]
  - ⚠️ INCONSISTENT: [specific issue and location] 
  - ❌ CONTRADICTION: [specific contradiction found]
