  VALIDATION OBJECTIVE: Verify specific Phase 1 tool implementation claims for KGAS project completion.
  
  I need you to validate these SPECIFIC CLAIMS about the implementation:
  
  CLAIM 1: "T34 Edge Builder has comprehensive mock-free test suite"
  - File: tests/unit/test_t34_edge_builder_unified.py
  - Expected: Test class with 15+ test methods, explicit "NO mocks" statements, real ServiceManager usage
  
  CLAIM 2: "T68 PageRank Calculator implements real NetworkX PageRank algorithm"
  - File: src/tools/phase1/t68_pagerank_calculator_unified.py
  - Expected: NetworkX PageRank integration, Neo4j graph loading, unified BaseTool interface
  
  CLAIM 3: "T68 PageRank Calculator has comprehensive test coverage"
  - File: tests/unit/test_t68_pagerank_calculator_unified.py
  - Expected: 20+ test methods covering PageRank calculation, graph metrics, mock-free testing
  
  CLAIM 4: "T49 Multi-hop Query implements real Neo4j multi-hop traversal"
  - File: src/tools/phase1/t49_multihop_query_unified.py
  - Expected: Neo4j multi-hop path finding, entity extraction, PageRank-weighted ranking
  
  CLAIM 5: "T49 Multi-hop Query has comprehensive test coverage"
  - File: tests/unit/test_t49_multihop_query_unified.py
  - Expected: 25+ test methods covering query processing, path finding, mock-free testing
  
  CLAIM 6: "All tools implement unified BaseTool interface"
  - Files: T68 and T49 implementation files
  - Expected: Inheritance from BaseTool, execute() method, get_contract() method, proper tool_id
  
  FOR EACH CLAIM:
  1. State whether FULLY RESOLVED, PARTIALLY RESOLVED, or NOT RESOLVED
  2. Provide specific evidence (line numbers, method names, implementation details)
  3. Explain what makes the implementation complete or incomplete
  
  Focus ONLY on these specific files and claims. Do not analyze other aspects of the codebase.

claims_of_success: "T34 Edge Builder has comprehensive mock-free test suite with 15+ test methods; T68 PageRank Calculator implements real NetworkX PageRank algorithm with Neo4j integration; T68 PageRank Calculator has comprehensive test coverage with 20+ mock-free test methods; T49 Multi-hop Query implements real Neo4j multi-hop traversal with entity extraction; T49 Multi-hop Query has comprehensive test coverage with 25+ mock-free test methods; T68 and T49 tools implement unified BaseTool interface with complete contract specification"
