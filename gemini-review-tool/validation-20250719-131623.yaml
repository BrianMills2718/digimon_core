claims_of_success: |
  CLAIM 1: Import Dependency Cleanup - 52 relative imports converted to absolute imports
  - LOCATION: 11 files across src/ directory (core, tools, agents, ontology_library)
  - EXPECTED: All "from .." and "from ..." imports replaced with "from src.*" imports
  - VALIDATION: Search through files shows zero remaining relative imports

  CLAIM 2: Service instantiation working after import cleanup
  - LOCATION: Core services in src/core/ directory
  - EXPECTED: All services instantiate without circular dependency errors
  - VALIDATION: ServiceManager, ToolFactory, security modules all import and instantiate correctly

  CLAIM 3: SecurityManager comprehensive unit testing with 73% coverage
  - LOCATION: tests/unit/test_security_manager.py and src/core/security_manager.py
  - EXPECTED: 49 comprehensive tests covering authentication, authorization, encryption, validation
  - VALIDATION: Test file contains real functionality tests (no mocked core methods)

  CLAIM 4: Tool factory refactoring completed with service separation
  - LOCATION: src/core/tool_*_service.py files and src/core/tool_factory_refactored.py
  - EXPECTED: Monolithic ToolFactory split into 4 focused services plus facade pattern
  - VALIDATION: ToolDiscoveryService, ToolRegistryService, ToolAuditService, ToolPerformanceMonitor exist with RefactoredToolFactory facade

custom_prompt: |
  Please validate the specific implementation claims for Phase 5.3 completion by carefully reviewing the provided files.
  
  **CONTEXT**: Phase 5.3 implementation has been completed with claims about import cleanup, service instantiation, unit testing, and tool factory refactoring.
  
  FOCUS ON VALIDATING THESE 4 SPECIFIC CLAIMS:
  
  1. **Import Dependency Cleanup**: Verify that relative imports (from .. and from ...) have been converted to absolute imports (from src.*)
  2. **Service Instantiation**: Verify that core services can be imported and instantiated without circular dependencies
  3. **SecurityManager Unit Testing**: Verify comprehensive test coverage with real functionality testing (not mocked)
  4. **Tool Factory Refactoring**: Verify monolithic class split into focused services with facade pattern
  
  VALIDATION CRITERIA - Each claim must be validated with:
  - **Implementation Present**: Does the claimed change actually exist in the code?
  - **Requirements Met**: Does the implementation satisfy the specific requirements?
  - **Quality Standards**: Is the implementation complete and production-ready?
  - **Evidence Consistency**: Do the files support the claims made?
  
  For each claim, provide verdict:
  - ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**: Implementation present, complete, meets all requirements with evidence
  - ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: Implementation present but incomplete or doesn't fully meet requirements
  - ❌ **NOT RESOLVED**: Implementation missing, inadequate, or claims not supported by code
  
  **DETAILED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**:
  
  **CLAIM 1 - Import Dependency Cleanup**:
  - Must verify: No remaining "from .." or "from ..." imports in the included files
  - Must verify: All imports use absolute paths starting with "from src."
  - Must verify: No circular import dependencies that would prevent service instantiation
  - Evidence required: Actual import statements show absolute paths
  
  **CLAIM 2 - Service Instantiation**:
  - Must verify: ServiceManager can be imported and instantiated
  - Must verify: ToolFactory and related classes can be imported
  - Must verify: SecurityManager and core services import correctly
  - Evidence required: Import statements and class definitions support instantiation
  
  **CLAIM 3 - SecurityManager Unit Testing**:
  - Must verify: test_security_manager.py contains comprehensive tests
  - Must verify: Tests cover authentication, authorization, encryption, validation
  - Must verify: Tests use real SecurityManager methods (not mocked core functionality)
  - Must verify: Test coverage includes edge cases and error scenarios
  - Evidence required: Actual test methods with real functionality calls
  
  **CLAIM 4 - Tool Factory Refactoring**:
  - Must verify: ToolDiscoveryService, ToolRegistryService, ToolAuditService, ToolPerformanceMonitor exist
  - Must verify: RefactoredToolFactory implements facade pattern
  - Must verify: Service separation with single responsibility principle
  - Must verify: Each service has focused, non-overlapping functionality
  - Evidence required: Service classes with clear method separation and facade delegation
  
  **CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**:
  1. Are the import changes genuine with no remaining relative imports?
  2. Do the services actually instantiate without circular dependency errors?
  3. Are the unit tests comprehensive with real functionality validation?
  4. Is the tool factory refactoring complete with proper service separation?
  
  Reference specific line numbers and file sections in your analysis.
  Validate whether each claim is fully supported by the actual code implementation.
