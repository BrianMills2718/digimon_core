VALIDATION OBJECTIVE: Verify implementation claims for Phase 2.1 Graph Analytics Tools (T50 Community Detection and T51 Centrality Analysis)

VALIDATION CRITERIA FOR EACH CLAIM:
1. **Implementation Present**: Does the method/feature exist where claimed?
2. **Functionality Complete**: Is it fully implemented (not stub/placeholder)?
3. **Requirements Met**: Does it satisfy the specific requirements mentioned?

For each claim below, provide a verdict of FULLY RESOLVED, PARTIALLY RESOLVED, or NOT RESOLVED with specific line number references.

CLAIMS TO VALIDATE:

T50 Community Detection:
- T50 Community Detection implements real Louvain algorithm using NetworkX
- T50 supports multiple community detection algorithms: Louvain, Leiden, Label Propagation, Greedy Modularity, Fluid Communities
- T50 calculates modularity scores and comprehensive community statistics
- T50 loads graph data from multiple sources: Neo4j, NetworkX, edge lists, adjacency matrices
- T50 provides academic-quality confidence scoring based on modularity and algorithm reliability
- T50 achieves 71% test coverage through real functionality testing (22 tests passing)

T51 Centrality Analysis:
- T51 Centrality Analysis implements 12 real centrality metrics including degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, PageRank
- T51 includes advanced metrics: Katz, harmonic, load, information, current flow betweenness/closeness, subgraph centrality
- T51 calculates correlation matrix between different centrality metrics using numpy
- T51 provides PageRank fallback implementations for scipy compatibility issues
- T51 supports comprehensive graph statistics calculation including connectivity and path length analysis
- T51 achieves 65% test coverage through real functionality testing (22 tests passing)

General Claims:
- Both tools follow BaseTool interface with standardized ToolRequest/ToolResult patterns
- Both tools implement academic-quality output formatting with publication-ready statistics
- Both tools include comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and fallback mechanisms

FOCUS AREAS:
- Real algorithm implementations (no mocking in core functionality)
- Academic-quality statistical analysis and confidence scoring
- Comprehensive test coverage with real graph data
- BaseTool interface compliance and standardized patterns
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms for compatibility

Please examine the actual implementation code provided and give specific verdicts with line number evidence.
