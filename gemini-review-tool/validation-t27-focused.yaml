  T27 RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTOR IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION:
  
  1. **T27 Unified BaseTool Interface**: Complete implementation with real spaCy processing
     - File: src/tools/phase1/t27_relationship_extractor_unified.py
     - Expected: Class T27RelationshipExtractorUnified inheriting from BaseTool
     - Expected: execute() method returning ToolResult, get_contract() method
     - Expected: Real spaCy nlp initialization and processing (not mocked)
  
  2. **T27 Mock-Free Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing with zero mocking
     - File: tests/unit/test_t27_relationship_extractor_unified.py
     - Expected: TestT27RelationshipExtractorUnifiedMockFree class
     - Expected: Real ServiceManager usage, no Mock imports
     - Expected: 15+ test methods with real functionality testing

custom_prompt: |
  VALIDATE T27 RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTOR IMPLEMENTATION
  
  Check the following specific criteria:
  
  1. **BaseTool Interface Compliance**:
     - T27RelationshipExtractorUnified inherits from BaseTool
     - Implements execute(request: ToolRequest) -> ToolResult
     - Implements get_contract() method
     - Uses ToolErrorCode for error handling
  
  2. **Real spaCy Integration**:
     - Uses real spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") initialization
     - Has dependency parsing functionality
     - Not using mocked spaCy components
  
  3. **Mock-Free Testing**:
     - Test class named TestT27RelationshipExtractorUnifiedMockFree
     - No unittest.mock imports
     - Uses real ServiceManager instances
     - Tests actual relationship extraction functionality
  
  For each criteria, provide:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED with line numbers and code examples
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED with specific issues
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED with clear problems
