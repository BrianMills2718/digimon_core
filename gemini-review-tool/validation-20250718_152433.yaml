# claim_5_scalability_terms_removed: "All enterprise/scalability terminology replaced with academic research focus"
# claim_6_sot_authority_clear: "Clear SSoT authority structure with no conflicts between roadmap.md and KGAS_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md"

custom_prompt: |
  You are validating specific documentation consistency fixes implemented in the KGAS project. The goal is to verify that critical inconsistencies have been properly resolved.

  ## VALIDATION OBJECTIVES

  ### CLAIM 1: Academic Research Tool Focus Established
  **What to verify**: All documents consistently present KGAS as "academic research tool for local, single-node research"
  **Check in**: CLAUDE.md, README.md, roadmap.md, KGAS_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md
  **Success criteria**: 
  - No "production-ready" or "enterprise" claims remain
  - Consistent use of "academic", "research", "experimental" terminology
  - System purpose clearly stated as academic research

  ### CLAIM 2: Phase 4 Status Uncertainty Resolved
  **What to verify**: Phase 4 status conflicts resolved by marking as uncertain with proper SSoT references
  **Check in**: CLAUDE.md (should show "UNCERTAIN" with reference to roadmap.md)
  **Success criteria**:
  - CLAUDE.md shows Phase 4 as "❓ UNCERTAIN"
  - Clear reference to roadmap.md as authoritative source
  - No internal contradictions about Phase 4 completion

  ### CLAIM 3: Production Claims Removed
  **What to verify**: All contradictory production readiness claims eliminated
  **Check in**: README.md, CLAUDE.md
  **Success criteria**:
  - README.md: No "85-90% production ready" claim
  - CLAUDE.md: No "Phase 4 COMPLETE" or "production-ready" claims
  - Replaced with academic research capability terminology

  ### CLAIM 4: Broken References Fixed
  **What to verify**: Navigation links and cross-references corrected
  **Check in**: README.md
  **Success criteria**:
  - Navigation links point to existing files with correct paths
  - No references to "ROADMAP_v2.1.md" or non-existent files
  - Support section references valid documentation

  ### CLAIM 5: Scalability Terms Removed
  **What to verify**: Enterprise/scalability terminology replaced with academic focus
  **Check in**: roadmap.md
  **Success criteria**:
  - No "microservices" or "scalability" references
  - Replaced with "modular architecture" and "research flexibility"
  - Strategic focus updated to academic research

  ### CLAIM 6: SSoT Authority Structure Clear
  **What to verify**: Clear, non-conflicting authority claims between documents
  **Check in**: roadmap.md, KGAS_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md
  **Success criteria**:
  - roadmap.md clearly claims authority over project status
  - KGAS_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md clearly claims authority over architecture
  - No overlapping or conflicting authority claims
  - Both documents reference appropriate scope

  ## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

  For each claim, provide:
  1. **Specific file and line references** where the fix is implemented
  2. **Direct quotes** showing the corrected content
  3. **Verification status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED, ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED, or ❌ NOT RESOLVED
  4. **Evidence analysis**: Why the fix is complete or what remains to be done

  ## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR VALIDATION

  Each claim is FULLY RESOLVED if:
  - The specific change is implemented in the identified files
  - The terminology is consistent across all relevant documents
  - No contradictory information remains
  - References and navigation work correctly

  Be extremely specific about file locations and quote the exact corrected content to prove each fix was properly implemented.
