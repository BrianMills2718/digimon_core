custom_prompt: |
  You are validating specific implementation claims for Phase 3 critical fixes. 
  
  **VALIDATION OBJECTIVE**: Verify that stub/mock implementations have been replaced with complete, functional code.
  
  **VALIDATION CRITERIA** - For each claim, verify:
  1. **Implementation Present**: Does the method/feature exist in the specified file and line?
  2. **Functionality Complete**: Is it fully implemented (not a stub/placeholder/TODO)?
  3. **Requirements Met**: Does it satisfy the specific requirements mentioned?
  
  **IMPORTANT**: 
  - Focus ONLY on the specific claims listed below
  - Reference exact line numbers from the included files
  - Look for actual implementation code, not stubs or TODOs
  - Verify each claim individually and provide specific evidence
