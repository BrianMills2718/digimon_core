project_name: "Cross-Modal Analysis Consistency Check"

include_patterns:
  - "docs/architecture/cross-modal-analysis.md"
  - "docs/architecture/concepts/cross-modal-philosophy.md"

custom_prompt: |
  Validate ONLY cross-modal analysis consistency between these two architecture files:

  **SPECIFIC CONSISTENCY CHECKS**:
  1. **100% Semantic Preservation Claims**: Are the claims about 100% semantic preservation consistent between both files?
  2. **CrossModalEntity System**: Is the CrossModalEntity system described consistently in both files?
  3. **Philosophy vs Implementation**: Do the technical specs in cross-modal-analysis.md align with the philosophy in cross-modal-philosophy.md?
  4. **Validation Evidence**: Are the evidence file references (src/core/cross_modal_entity.py, stress_test files) consistent?

  **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**:
  - Quote specific inconsistencies with file names and section references
  - Verify file path references are accurate
  - Check if quantified metrics (100%, 40%, etc.) match

  **IGNORE**: Everything not related to cross-modal analysis consistency

  **OUTPUT FORMAT**:
  - ✅ CONSISTENT: [specific evidence]
  - ⚠️ INCONSISTENT: [specific issue and location]
  - ❌ CONTRADICTION: [specific contradiction found]
