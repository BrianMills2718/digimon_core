claims_of_success: |
  CLAIM 1: AsyncAPIClient comprehensive unit testing with 75% coverage achieved
  - LOCATION: tests/unit/test_async_api_client*.py files (4 step files)
  - EXPECTED: 62 comprehensive tests covering initialization, caching, performance, request processing, error handling
  - VALIDATION: Test files contain real functionality tests with no mocked core methods, systematic coverage across all major functionality

  CLAIM 2: Systematic 4-step testing approach implemented
  - LOCATION: test_async_api_client.py, test_async_api_client_step3.py, test_async_api_client_step4.py
  - EXPECTED: Step 1 (basic setup), Step 2 (client initialization), Step 3 (caching/performance), Step 4 (request processing/error handling)
  - VALIDATION: Each step focuses on specific functionality areas with clear test organization

  CLAIM 3: Real functionality validation without mocked core methods
  - LOCATION: All async API client test files
  - EXPECTED: Tests call actual AsyncAPIClient methods, mock only external dependencies (not core functionality)
  - VALIDATION: Tests instantiate real clients and call actual methods like _make_actual_request, get_performance_metrics

  CLAIM 4: Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
  - LOCATION: test_async_api_client_step4.py TestErrorHandling and TestEdgeCases classes
  - EXPECTED: Tests for client exceptions, service unavailability, empty requests, resource cleanup
  - VALIDATION: Error scenarios tested with realistic failure conditions and proper exception handling

custom_prompt: |
  Please validate the specific AsyncAPIClient unit testing implementation claims by carefully reviewing the provided test files.
  
  **CONTEXT**: AsyncAPIClient unit testing has been implemented using a systematic 4-step approach to achieve 75% coverage with 62 comprehensive tests.
  
  FOCUS ON VALIDATING THESE 4 SPECIFIC CLAIMS:
  
  1. **AsyncAPIClient Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Verify 75% coverage achieved with 62 comprehensive tests
  2. **Systematic 4-Step Testing Approach**: Verify organized test structure across multiple test files
  3. **Real Functionality Validation**: Verify tests use actual AsyncAPIClient methods, not mocked core functionality
  4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Verify error scenarios and edge cases are thoroughly tested
  
  VALIDATION CRITERIA - Each claim must be validated with:
  - **Implementation Present**: Does the claimed testing implementation actually exist in the test files?
  - **Requirements Met**: Does the implementation satisfy the specific testing requirements?
  - **Quality Standards**: Are the tests comprehensive and production-ready?
  - **Evidence Consistency**: Do the test files support the claims made about coverage and approach?
  
  For each claim, provide verdict:
  - ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**: Implementation present, complete, meets all requirements with evidence
  - ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: Implementation present but incomplete or doesn't fully meet requirements
  - ❌ **NOT RESOLVED**: Implementation missing, inadequate, or claims not supported by code
  
  **DETAILED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**:
  
  **CLAIM 1 - AsyncAPIClient Comprehensive Unit Testing**:
  - Must verify: Test files contain comprehensive coverage of AsyncAPIClient functionality
  - Must verify: Tests are systematic and well-organized across multiple test classes
  - Must verify: Test count approaches 62 tests across all test files
  - Evidence required: Actual test methods covering initialization, caching, performance, request processing
  
  **CLAIM 2 - Systematic 4-Step Testing Approach**:
  - Must verify: test_async_api_client.py contains basic setup and initialization tests
  - Must verify: test_async_api_client_step3.py contains caching and performance tests
  - Must verify: test_async_api_client_step4.py contains request processing and error handling tests
  - Evidence required: Clear organization with each step focusing on specific functionality areas
  
  **CLAIM 3 - Real Functionality Validation**:
  - Must verify: Tests instantiate actual AsyncAPIClient instances
  - Must verify: Tests call real methods like _make_actual_request, get_performance_metrics, process_concurrent_requests
  - Must verify: Core functionality is not mocked (external dependencies like OpenAI/Gemini clients may be mocked)
  - Evidence required: Test methods show direct calls to AsyncAPIClient methods with real assertions
  
  **CLAIM 4 - Comprehensive Error Handling**:
  - Must verify: TestErrorHandling class exists with tests for client exceptions and service failures
  - Must verify: TestEdgeCases class exists with tests for edge scenarios
  - Must verify: Tests cover empty requests, resource cleanup, multiple close calls
  - Evidence required: Error testing methods with realistic failure conditions and proper exception handling
  
  **CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**:
  1. Are the unit tests comprehensive and systematic across multiple organized test files?
  2. Do the tests call actual AsyncAPIClient methods rather than mocking core functionality?
  3. Is error handling and edge case testing thorough and realistic?
  4. Does the testing approach demonstrate 4-step systematic organization?
  
  Reference specific line numbers and test method names in your analysis.
  Validate whether each claim is fully supported by the actual test implementation.
