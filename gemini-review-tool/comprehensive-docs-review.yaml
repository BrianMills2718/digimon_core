  You are conducting a comprehensive documentation audit for the KGAS (Knowledge Graph AI System) project to identify ALL inconsistencies, conflicts, and structural problems across the entire documentation set.

  ## CRITICAL FOCUS AREAS

  ### 1. PROJECT STATUS CONSISTENCY
  - **Phase status conflicts**: Compare claims across CLAUDE.md, README.md, roadmap.md, and phase implementation plans
  - **Completion claims**: Verify any "complete" or "implemented" claims against actual documented evidence
  - **Timeline inconsistencies**: Check for conflicting dates, milestones, and progress reports
  - **Implementation vs documentation gaps**: Identify where documentation claims don't match described reality

  ### 2. ARCHITECTURAL ALIGNMENT
  - **System description consistency**: Do all docs describe the same system architecture?
  - **Component naming**: Are components consistently named across all documentation?
  - **Technology stack alignment**: Are technology choices consistently described?
  - **Data flow consistency**: Do architecture docs align with implementation guides?

  ### 3. DOCUMENTATION ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS
  - **Redundant content**: Identify duplicate information that should be consolidated
  - **Broken cross-references**: Find references to missing or moved files
  - **Outdated file references**: Check for references to old versions or deprecated docs
  - **Authority conflicts**: Multiple docs claiming to be "authoritative" or "single source of truth"

  ### 4. CONTENT QUALITY ISSUES
  - **Accuracy problems**: Technical claims that appear incorrect or unverifiable
  - **Completeness gaps**: Missing critical information for users or developers
  - **Clarity issues**: Confusing or contradictory instructions
  - **Actionability problems**: Guidance that cannot be followed as written

  ### 5. SPECIFIC INCONSISTENCY PATTERNS TO CHECK
  - **Phase 4 status**: Is Phase 4 consistently described as complete/incomplete across all docs?
  - **Production readiness**: Are production capabilities consistently described?
  - **Tool counts**: Are tool implementation numbers consistent across documents?
  - **Validation claims**: Do validation reports match claimed implementation status?
  - **Roadmap alignment**: Do phase plans match the master roadmap?

  ## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

  ### For EVERY inconsistency found:
  1. **Cite specific files and line numbers** where conflicts occur
  2. **Quote the conflicting statements** directly
  3. **Assess the impact** - does this create confusion or block progress?
  4. **Recommend resolution** - which version is correct or how to reconcile

  ### Priority classification:
  - **CRITICAL**: Blocks project understanding or creates false claims
  - **HIGH**: Creates confusion for developers or users  
  - **MEDIUM**: Minor inconsistencies that should be cleaned up
  - **LOW**: Style or formatting issues

  ## DELIVERABLES REQUIRED

  1. **Executive Summary**: Top 5 most critical documentation problems
  2. **Detailed Inconsistency Report**: All conflicts found with specific citations
  3. **Structural Problems Analysis**: Organization and navigation issues
  4. **Authority Conflicts**: Documents claiming conflicting authority
  5. **Missing Documentation Gaps**: Critical missing information
  6. **Prioritized Action Plan**: What to fix first, second, third
  7. **Truth Reconciliation Plan**: How to establish single source of truth for each topic

  ## SUCCESS CRITERIA
  This analysis succeeds if it:
  - Identifies ALL major documentation inconsistencies
  - Provides specific, actionable recommendations
  - Establishes a clear plan for documentation cleanup
  - Prevents future documentation integrity problems

  Be thorough, specific, and actionable. The goal is to restore complete documentation integrity across the entire project.
