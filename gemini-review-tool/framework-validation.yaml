  VALIDATION OBJECTIVE: Verify the comprehensive stress test framework implementation.

  SPECIFIC CLAIMS TO VALIDATE:

  **COMPREHENSIVE STRESS TEST FRAMEWORK** (run_stress_test.py):
  - Complete end-to-end testing orchestrator implemented
  - Four distinct test components: schema validation, algorithm validation, database integration, cross-modal analysis
  - Real test execution with results saving and reporting
  - Performance metrics and success rate calculation

  VALIDATION CRITERIA:
  - **Implementation Present**: Does the stress test orchestrator exist?
  - **Functionality Complete**: Are all four test components implemented?
  - **Requirements Met**: Does it provide real execution, results saving, and performance metrics?
  - **Architecture Sound**: Is the testing framework well-structured?

  Please analyze the code and provide verdict:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Complete implementation with evidence
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Implementation present but with limitations  
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Missing or incomplete implementation

  Focus on specific line numbers and architectural evidence.
