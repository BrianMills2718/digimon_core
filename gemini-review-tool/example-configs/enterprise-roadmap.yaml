custom_prompt: |
  Perform a critical evaluation against the Enterprise Roadmap v2 requirements.
  Be especially skeptical of claims vs. reality.
  Focus on:
  1. Phase 0 completion status
  2. Architectural compliance
  3. Code quality and technical debt
  4. Production readiness
  5. Discrepancies between documentation and implementation
