# Include patterns - only these files will be processed
# If include_patterns is specified, only matching files are included

# Ignore patterns - applied after include patterns
# These will still be excluded even if they match include patterns

# Documentation files to include in analysis

# Custom prompt for focused review

  Focus on code quality and maintainability:
  - Code structure and organization
  - Function and class design
  - Error handling patterns
  - Documentation quality
  - Test coverage indicators

# Example of different include strategies:

# Strategy 1: Core application only
# include_patterns:
#   - "src/**/*.py"
#   - "main.py"
#   - "app.py"

# Strategy 2: Configuration and docs only
# include_patterns:
#   - "*.yaml"
#   - "*.json"
#   - "*.md"
#   - "*.txt"

# Strategy 3: Specific modules only
# include_patterns:
#   - "src/auth/**/*.py"
#   - "src/api/**/*.py"
#   - "tests/test_auth.py"
#   - "tests/test_api.py"
