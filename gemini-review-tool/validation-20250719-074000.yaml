custom_prompt: |
  Validate the Task 4 Async API Client Enhancement implementation claims by examining the async_api_client.py file.
  
  For each claim, verify:
  1. IMPLEMENTATION PRESENT: Does the claimed feature exist in the specified file/lines?
  2. FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE: Is it fully implemented (not a stub or placeholder)?
  3. REQUIREMENTS MET: Does it satisfy the specific technical requirements mentioned?
  
  Pay special attention to:
  - Actual code implementation vs. comments or placeholders
  - Specific parameter values mentioned in claims (e.g., limit=100, batch_size=50)
  - Method existence and functionality (e.g., get_performance_metrics, benchmark_performance)
  - Enhanced concurrency limits (OpenAI: 25, Gemini: 15)
  
  For each of the 5 claims, provide a verdict:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Implementation present, complete, and meets requirements
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Implementation present but incomplete or doesn't fully meet requirements  
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Implementation missing, broken, or doesn't meet requirements
  
  Reference specific line numbers and code examples from the file when making your assessment.
