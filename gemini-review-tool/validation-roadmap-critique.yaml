custom_prompt: |
  Perform a comprehensive architectural and strategic critique of the KGAS project roadmap documentation. Analyze for:

  1. **Strategic Coherence**:
     - Do the phases build logically on each other?
     - Are dependencies clearly identified and managed?
     - Is the overall vision achievable with the proposed timeline?
     - Does the parallel roadmap align with the sequential roadmap?
     - Are there contradictions between different planning documents?

  2. **Architectural Alignment**:
     - Does the roadmap align with the architectural vision in ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md?
     - Are the ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) being followed in the implementation?
     - Is there a clear path from current state to target architecture?
     - Are architectural risks identified and mitigated?

  3. **Phase Definition Quality**:
     - Are success criteria clearly defined for each phase?
     - Are deliverables concrete and measurable?
     - Is the scope of each phase appropriate (not too large/small)?
     - Are timelines realistic given the scope?

  4. **Technical Debt & Risk Management**:
     - Is the Phase RELIABILITY addressing the right critical issues?
     - Are there unaddressed technical risks in the roadmap?
     - Is technical debt being managed proactively?
     - Are there single points of failure in the plan?

  5. **Resource Optimization**:
     - Is the parallelization strategy actually feasible?
     - Are the claimed time savings realistic?
     - Is the solo developer + AI agents model sustainable?
     - Are there better ways to sequence the work?

  6. **Completeness & Clarity**:
     - Are there gaps in the roadmap (missing phases, tools, features)?
     - Is the documentation consistent across all files?
     - Are success metrics clearly defined?
     - Is progress tracking methodology adequate?

  7. **TDD Integration**:
     - Is the TDD philosophy properly integrated throughout?
     - Are there phases where TDD might be difficult to apply?
     - Is the TDD rollout plan realistic?

  8. **Buy vs Build Decisions**:
     - Are the Phase 8 external integrations well justified?
     - Are there other areas where buy vs build should be considered?
     - Is the ROI calculation for external integrations realistic?

  9. **Critical Observations**:
     - What are the biggest risks to project success?
     - What key decisions need to be made?
     - What alternative approaches should be considered?
     - What's missing from the current roadmap?

  10. **Recommendations**:
      - Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement
      - Suggest alternative phasing or sequencing if beneficial
      - Identify quick wins that could accelerate progress
      - Recommend areas for deeper investigation

  Focus on providing strategic insights that will help improve project planning and execution.
  Be direct and critical where necessary - this is for internal improvement purposes.
