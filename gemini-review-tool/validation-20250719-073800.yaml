  TASK 4: ASYNC API CLIENT ENHANCEMENT CLAIMS
  
  CLAIM 1: Enhanced Connection Pooling Implementation
  - File: src/core/async_api_client.py
  - Expected: aiohttp.TCPConnector with limit=100, limit_per_host=30, DNS cache, keep-alive
  - Lines: Around 296-303 in initialize_clients method
  
  CLAIM 2: Increased Concurrency Limits  
  - File: src/core/async_api_client.py
  - Expected: OpenAI semaphore increased from 10 to 25, Gemini from 5 to 15
  - Lines: Around 261-264 in __init__ method
  
  CLAIM 3: Response Caching System
  - File: src/core/async_api_client.py  
  - Expected: TTL cache (300s), size limit (1000), automatic cleanup, cache hit tracking
  - Lines: Cache methods around 397-421, cache_ttl=300, response_cache dict
  
  CLAIM 4: Batch Processing Optimization
  - File: src/core/async_api_client.py
  - Expected: Background batch processor, async queue, optimal batch sizes (50 OpenAI, 20 Gemini)
  - Lines: Batch methods around 331-372, process_batch_queue, _create_embeddings_batch with batch_size=50
  
  CLAIM 5: Performance Monitoring
  - File: src/core/async_api_client.py
  - Expected: Performance metrics tracking, get_performance_metrics method, benchmark_performance method
  - Lines: performance_metrics dict around 275-283, get_performance_metrics around 599-611
  
  CLAIM 6: 50-60% Performance Improvement Achievement
  - File: test_async_performance.py + async_performance_test_results.json
  - Expected: Test shows >50% improvement, results document 98.1% improvement achieved
  - Evidence: Performance test execution and documented results
  
  CLAIM 7: All Integration Tests Pass
  - File: test_real_async_client.py
  - Expected: 4/4 tests pass, all 7 optimization features verified as implemented
  - Evidence: Real async client can be imported, initialized, features present, benchmarks work

custom_prompt: |
  Validate the Task 4 Async API Client Enhancement implementation claims by examining the provided code files.
  
  For each claim, verify:
  1. IMPLEMENTATION PRESENT: Does the claimed feature exist in the specified file/lines?
  2. FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE: Is it fully implemented (not a stub or placeholder)?
  3. REQUIREMENTS MET: Does it satisfy the specific technical requirements mentioned?
  
  Pay special attention to:
  - Actual code implementation vs. comments or placeholders
  - Specific parameter values mentioned in claims (e.g., limit=100, batch_size=50)
  - Method existence and functionality (e.g., get_performance_metrics, benchmark_performance)
  - Test results and evidence of performance improvements
  
  For each of the 7 claims, provide a verdict:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Implementation present, complete, and meets requirements
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Implementation present but incomplete or doesn't fully meet requirements  
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Implementation missing, broken, or doesn't meet requirements
  
  Reference specific line numbers and code examples from the files when making your assessment.
