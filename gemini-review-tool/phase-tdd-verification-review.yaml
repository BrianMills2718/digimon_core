  For each claim:
  - ✅ FULLY RESOLVED: Complete implementation with evidence across all tools
  - ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Partial implementation or minor issues on specific tools
  - ❌ NOT RESOLVED: Implementation missing or inadequate on one or more tools
  
  **FOCUS AREAS**: 
  1. Examine all 4 test files line-by-line for any mock usage patterns
  2. Verify real file generation and processing code for T03 (text) and T04 (markdown)
  3. Validate real chunking algorithms and tokenization in T15A
  4. Confirm real spaCy model usage and entity extraction in T23A
  5. Validate coverage reports show genuine functionality testing across all tools with T15A reaching 88%
  6. Confirm evidence files contain authentic execution data for all 4 tools with comprehensive logs
  7. Check for any hidden or subtle mocking patterns across the expanded tool set
  8. Verify the 100% test success rate (67/67 passing) represents complete genuine functionality validation with all comprehensive workflow tests now successful
  
  Be extremely thorough in detecting any remaining mocking or false claims across all 4 tools. The goal is production-ready, mock-free testing with genuine functionality coverage extending the proven T01/T02 methodology to achieve consistent testing excellence across the entire phase, with T15A specifically meeting the 88% coverage target.
