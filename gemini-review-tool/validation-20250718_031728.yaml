  You are validating the implementation claims for CLAUDE.md Phase 1 Foundation Optimization.
  
  Please analyze the provided files ONLY and verify these specific claims:
  
  **CLAIM 1: UNIFIED_CONFIG_SYSTEM**
  - File: src/core/unified_config.py
  - Claim: "Unified configuration system implemented that replaces both ConfigurationManager and ConfigManager"
  - Requirements: 
    * UnifiedConfigManager class exists
    * Handles database, API, and system configurations
    * Provides get_config() global function
    * Supports environment variable overrides
    * Includes backward compatibility aliases
  
  **CLAIM 2: ASYNC_API_CLIENTS**
  - File: src/core/async_api_clients.py
  - Claim: "Real async API clients implemented with aiohttp for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs"
  - Requirements:
    * AsyncOpenAIClient class with aiohttp implementation
    * AsyncAnthropicClient class with aiohttp implementation
    * AsyncGoogleClient class with aiohttp implementation
    * All clients support async context managers (__aenter__, __aexit__)
    * Real HTTP requests (not mocks or stubs)
  
  **CLAIM 3: HEALTH_CHECKER**
  - File: src/core/health_checker.py
  - Claim: "Comprehensive health checker implemented with async dependency monitoring"
  - Requirements:
    * HealthChecker class with async methods
    * Checks Neo4j, Redis, OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google API, filesystem, system resources
    * check_all_dependencies() method returns health status
    * get_health_checker() global function exists
    * Evidence logging functionality
  
  **CLAIM 4: MIGRATION_SCRIPT**
  - File: scripts/migrate_config_references.py
  - Claim: "Configuration migration script created to update all references"
  - Requirements:
    * migrate_config_references() function exists
    * Updates import statements and class instantiations
    * Logs migration results
    * Handles file modifications
  
  **CLAIM 5: ENV_DOCUMENTATION**
  - File: .env.example
  - Claim: "Comprehensive .env.example with all 47+ environment variables documented"
  - Requirements:
    * File exists and contains environment variable definitions
    * At least 47 environment variables documented
    * Variables organized by category (Database, API, System, etc.)
    * Proper format with KEY=value syntax
  
  For each claim, provide:
  1. **Implementation Analysis**: Quote specific code sections that fulfill the requirements
  2. **Completeness Assessment**: Is it fully implemented or just a stub/placeholder?
  3. **Requirements Check**: Does it meet all specified requirements?
  4. **Verdict**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED, ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED, or ❌ NOT RESOLVED
  
  Focus ONLY on the 5 files provided. Do not analyze other files or make assumptions about implementations not shown.
