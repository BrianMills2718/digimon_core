# KGAS Ethics Framework

**Document Version**: 1.0 (TORC Ethics Template)  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive ethics framework for KGAS development and deployment

## üéØ Overview

This document establishes the ethical framework for the Knowledge Graph Analysis System (KGAS), following the TORC (Transparency, Objectivity, Reproducibility, and Credibility) ethics template. The framework ensures responsible development and deployment of AI systems for knowledge graph analysis.

## üîç Transparency

### System Transparency
- **Algorithm Disclosure**: All processing algorithms are documented and accessible
- **Data Sources**: Clear documentation of training data and knowledge sources
- **Decision Processes**: Transparent explanation of entity extraction and relationship inference
- **Model Limitations**: Honest assessment of system capabilities and constraints

### Operational Transparency
- **Processing Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all processing steps
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages and failure explanations
- **Performance Metrics**: Transparent reporting of accuracy and performance
- **Version Tracking**: Complete version history of all system components

### User Transparency
- **Processing Information**: Users informed of what data is processed and how
- **Result Explanation**: Clear explanation of how results were generated
- **Confidence Scores**: Transparent confidence levels for all outputs
- **Source Attribution**: Clear attribution of information sources

## ‚öñÔ∏è Bias and Fairness

### Bias Detection
- **Data Bias Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for biases in training data
- **Algorithm Bias Testing**: Regular testing for algorithmic bias
- **Output Bias Analysis**: Analysis of system outputs for potential bias
