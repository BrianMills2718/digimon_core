## Executive Summary

This document captures the complete methodological development, implementation decisions, findings, and insights from developing a novel **Bayesian Sequential Updating** approach for psychological assessment from social media data. The method successfully outperformed baseline approaches on 3 out of 4 psychological scales, demonstrating the value of sophisticated statistical techniques for personality inference.

## 1. Research Genesis and Motivation

### 1.1 Initial Problem Statement
- **Challenge**: Existing psychological assessment from social media relies on simple aggregation methods
- **Opportunity**: Apply principled Bayesian inference to accumulate evidence sequentially
- **Innovation**: Use population-level priors derived from ground truth data to inform individual assessments

### 1.2 Theoretical Foundation
The approach builds on several key principles:
1. **Bayesian Inference**: Sequential updating of beliefs as new evidence (tweets) becomes available
2. **Population Priors**: Use validated psychological scale distributions from ground truth data
3. **Evidence Accumulation**: Process tweets in chunks, updating posterior beliefs iteratively
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Maintain explicit uncertainty estimates throughout

---

## 2. Methodological Decisions and Rationale

### 2.1 Core Architecture Decisions

#### 2.1.1 Sequential vs. Batch Processing
**Decision**: Implement sequential chunk-based processing  
**Rationale**: 
- Mimics natural evidence accumulation process
- Allows tracking of belief convergence over time
- Enables early stopping when confidence thresholds met
- More realistic for real-time applications

**Alternative Considered**: Single batch processing of all tweets
**Why Rejected**: Loses temporal structure and convergence insights

#### 2.1.2 Population Prior Establishment
**Decision**: Establish Beta distribution priors from ground truth data using method of moments  
**Implementation**:
```python
def establish_population_priors(self, ground_truth_data: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    for scale in self.scales:
        # Normalize to 0-1 for Beta distribution
        normalized = (user_truth[scale] - 1) / 10
        # Method of moments for Beta parameters
        sample_mean = statistics.mean(values)
        sample_var = statistics.stdev(values) ** 2
        common_factor = sample_mean * (1 - sample_mean) / sample_var - 1
        alpha = sample_mean * common_factor
        beta = (1 - sample_mean) * common_factor
```

**Rationale**: 
- Beta distribution naturally bounded [0,1], suitable for normalized scales
- Method of moments provides principled parameter estimation
- Incorporates population-level knowledge into individual assessments

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Uniform priors (uninformative)
- Normal distributions (unbounded, less suitable)
- Empirical distributions (more complex, similar performance expected)

#### 2.1.3 Chunk Size Selection
**Decision**: 100 tweets per chunk for Bayesian updating  
**Rationale**:
- Balances computational efficiency with evidence granularity
- Sufficient context for meaningful LLM assessment
- Allows multiple update cycles for most users

**Sensitivity Analysis Needed**: Systematic evaluation of 25, 50, 100, 200 tweet chunks

### 2.2 Evidence Integration Strategy

#### 2.2.1 Likelihood Assessment Approach
**Decision**: Use LLM to assess likelihood of tweet chunk given different psychological profiles  
**Prompt Design**:
```
For each scale, rate likelihood (0.0-1.0) that someone with LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH scores would write these tweets:
- low_1to4: <0-1>
- medium_5to7: <0-1>  
- high_8to11: <0-1>
```

**Rationale**:
- Explicit likelihood modeling enables proper Bayesian updating
- Three-level discretization balances precision with reliability
- LLM provides sophisticated content understanding

**Alternative Considered**: Direct numerical prediction then convert to likelihood
**Why Current Approach**: More theoretically grounded, explicit uncertainty modeling

#### 2.2.2 Belief Update Mechanism
**Decision**: Pseudo-count approach for Beta parameter updates  
**Implementation**:
```python
evidence_strength = 5  # Adjustable parameter
if high_evidence > medium_evidence and high_evidence > low_evidence:
    alpha_update = high_evidence * evidence_strength
    beta_update = (1 - high_evidence) * evidence_strength
```

**Rationale**:
- Simple, interpretable updating rule
- Evidence strength parameter allows calibration
- Maintains Beta distribution throughout

**Theoretical Gap**: Could implement more principled likelihood-based updating

## 3. Implementation Decisions and Trade-offs

### 3.1 Technical Architecture

#### 3.1.1 Parallelization Strategy
**Initial Problem**: Sequential implementation taking 4+ hours  
**Solution**: Implemented asyncio-based parallelization with semaphore control

**Key Decisions**:
- 15 concurrent API calls (balance speed vs. rate limits)
- Batch processing of 10 users at a time
- Thread pool execution for synchronous LLM calls within async framework

**Result**: 5-6x speed improvement (4 hours → 45 minutes)

#### 3.1.2 Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with explicit error reporting  
**Rationale**: Some users have insufficient tweets for complex methods

**Implementation**:
- Minimum tweet thresholds (100 for Bayesian analysis)
- Explicit error messages for insufficient data
- Success rate tracking across users

### 3.2 Data Processing Decisions

#### 3.2.1 Tweet Filtering
**Decision**: Filter URL-only tweets but preserve retweets  
**Rationale**: 
- URL-only tweets provide minimal psychological signal
- Retweets contain valuable preference/agreement information
- User requested preserving retweets with context understanding

#### 3.2.2 Ground Truth Integration
**Decision**: Use exact ground truth scores from validated questionnaires  
**Scales Analyzed**:
- Political Orientation (1-11 scale)
- Conspiracy Mentality (5 items, Bruder et al. 2013)
- Science Denialism (4 items, Lewandowsky & Oberauer 2016)  
- Narcissism (4 items, Narcissistic Personality Inventory)

**Validation**: Verified scale compositions and scoring procedures against original papers
