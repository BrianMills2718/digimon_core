# KGAS Reproducibility: Claude Code vs Controlled Workflows

## The Core Trade-off

You've identified the fundamental tension:
- **Claude Code**: Powerful, adaptive, but non-deterministic
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Deterministic, auditable, but rigid

## Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Pure Claude Code | Hybrid Approach | Pure YAML Workflows |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Reproducibility** | ❌ Non-deterministic | ✅ Configurable modes | ✅ Fully deterministic |
| **Ease of Use** | ✅ Natural language | ✅ Both NL and YAML | ❌ Requires YAML |
| **Adaptability** | ✅ Handles errors well | ✅ Guided adaptation | ❌ Fails on deviation |
| **Academic Publishing** | ❌ Can't guarantee same results | ✅ STRICT mode available | ✅ Perfect reproducibility |
| **Development Speed** | ✅ Fast prototyping | ⚠️ Mode selection overhead | ❌ Slow workflow design |
| **Tool Discovery** | ✅ Claude finds tools | ✅ Can discover or follow | ❌ Must specify all |
| **Error Recovery** | ✅ Automatic retry/adapt | ✅ Mode-dependent | ❌ Fails completely |
| **Audit Trail** | ❌ Limited visibility | ✅ Full logging | ✅ Complete trace |

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Publishing a Paper
**Requirement**: Results MUST be reproducible by reviewers

**Pure Claude Code Approach**:
```bash
# Problem: Each run might use different tool sequences
claude "Apply Kunst theory to speeches"
# Run 1: Uses subagents A, B, C with tools X, Y
# Run 2: Uses subagents B, D with tools Y, Z
# Results: Similar but not identical
```

**Hybrid STRICT Mode**:
```python
# Guaranteed same execution every time
result = orchestrator.execute_workflow(
    workflow_id="kunst_theory_v1.2.0",
    inputs={"theory": "kunst.pdf", "target": "carter.txt"},
    execution_mode=ExecutionMode.STRICT
)
# Saves complete execution record with hash
# Reviewers can replay: orchestrator.reproduce_execution("exec_20250125.json")
```

### Scenario 2: Exploratory Analysis
**Requirement**: Find unexpected insights, handle messy data

**Pure Claude Code Approach**:
```bash
# Excellent for exploration
claude "Find patterns in these 50 political speeches, focusing on psychological factors"
# Claude Code will:
# - Adapt to different file formats
# - Retry failed extractions
# - Discover relevant patterns
# - Use appropriate tools dynamically
```

**Hybrid AUTONOMOUS Mode**:
```python
# Best of both worlds
result = orchestrator.execute_workflow(
    workflow_id="exploratory_analysis",
    inputs={"documents": speech_files},
    execution_mode=ExecutionMode.AUTONOMOUS
)
# Claude Code has freedom but outputs are structured
# Execution is still logged for documentation
```

### Scenario 3: Production Pipeline
**Requirement**: Reliable, monitorable, but handle variations

**Hybrid GUIDED Mode**:
```python
# Balanced approach
result = orchestrator.execute_workflow(
    workflow_id="document_pipeline_v3",
    inputs={"documents": new_docs},
    execution_mode=ExecutionMode.GUIDED,
    constraints={
        "max_retries": 3,
        "timeout_minutes": 30,
        "required_outputs": ["entities", "graph", "summary"]
    }
)
# Claude Code can adapt within boundaries
# All adaptations are logged
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Start with Workflow Templates
Create a library of common workflows that can be executed in different modes:

```yaml
# research_workflows/theory_application.yaml
id: theory_application_v1
name: Apply Theory to Documents
phases:
  - name: theory_extraction
    tools:
      - tool: load_document
        critical: true  # Must succeed
      - tool: extract_theory
        parameters:
          method: ["kunst_2019", "davis_2020"]  # Claude can choose
  - name: application
    parallel: true
    adaptive: true  # Claude can optimize parallelization
```

### 2. Progressive Control Levels

```python
class ControlLevel:
    """Define what Claude Code can change"""
    
    NOTHING = {
        "change_tools": False,
        "change_parameters": False,
        "add_steps": False,
        "parallelize": False
    }
    
    PARAMETERS_ONLY = {
        "change_tools": False,
        "change_parameters": True,  # Within ranges
        "add_steps": False,
        "parallelize": False
    }
    
    OPTIMIZATION = {
        "change_tools": False,
        "change_parameters": True,
        "add_steps": True,  # For error handling
        "parallelize": True
    }
    
    FULL_AUTONOMY = {
        "change_tools": True,
        "change_parameters": True,
        "add_steps": True,
        "parallelize": True
    }
```

### 3. Execution Record Format

Every execution should produce:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "workflow": {
    "id": "theory_application_v1",
    "hash": "sha256_hash",
    "source": "workflows/theory_application.yaml"
  },
  "mode": "GUIDED",
  "inputs": {
    "theory_document": "kunst_paper.txt",
    "hash": "file_hash"
  },
  "decisions": [
    {
      "point": "parameter_selection",
      "chose": "confidence_threshold=0.85",
      "reason": "High-quality document",
      "alternatives": ["0.7", "0.8", "0.9"]
    }
  ],
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-01-25T10:00:00Z",
      "tool": "mcp__kgas__load_pdf",
      "inputs": {"file": "kunst_paper.txt"},
      "output_hash": "abc123",
      "duration_ms": 1250
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
    "theory_schema": "output/theory.json",
    "analysis_results": "output/analysis.json"
  }
}
```

### 4. Best Practices by Use Case

**For Academic Research**:
- Use STRICT mode for final results
- Use GUIDED mode during development
- Version control all workflows
- Include workflow hash in publications

**For Production Systems**:
- Use GUIDED mode with monitoring
- Define clear constraints
- Set up alerts for deviations
- Regular workflow validation

**For Exploration**:
- Start with AUTONOMOUS mode
- Capture interesting patterns
- Gradually formalize into workflows
- Move to GUIDED for repeatability

## The Pragmatic Path Forward

1. **Build the Hybrid System** - Supports both deterministic and adaptive execution
2. **Create Workflow Library** - Common patterns (theory extraction, doc analysis, etc.)
3. **Default to GUIDED Mode** - Good balance for most use cases
4. **Document Everything** - Every execution creates an audit trail
5. **Educate Users** - When to use which mode

This gives you:
- ✅ Reproducibility when you need it
- ✅ Claude Code's power when helpful  
- ✅ Clear audit trails always
- ✅ Flexibility to choose per task

The key insight: **Reproducibility is a requirement, not a feature**. The hybrid approach makes it configurable per use case rather than all-or-nothing.
