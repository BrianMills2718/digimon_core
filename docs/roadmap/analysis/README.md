# Analysis Directory

This directory contains architectural analysis and system analysis documents.

## Directory Structure

### Architecture Analysis (`/architecture/`)
High-level architectural analysis documents:
- `ARCHITECTURAL_BOTTLENECKS_ANALYSIS.md`
- `ARCHITECTURAL_STABILITY_REVIEW.md`

### KGAS-Specific Analysis (`/kgas-specific/`)
Detailed KGAS system analysis documents:
- `KGAS_01_Core_Architecture_and_Vision.md`
- `KGAS_02_Theoretical_Framework_and_Data.md`

## Purpose

These files provide:
- **System-wide analysis** of architectural patterns and bottlenecks
- **Comprehensive documentation** of KGAS architecture decisions
- **Index documents** for navigating complex architectural information

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Target Architecture**: [docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](../docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)
- **Implementation Status**: [docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md](../docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md)
- **Evidence**: [../evidence/README.md](../evidence/README.md)
