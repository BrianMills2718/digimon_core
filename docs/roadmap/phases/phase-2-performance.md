## Phase 2: Performance & Reliability

**Status**: ‚è≥ **PLANNED**

### Goal
Enhance system performance for multi-document processing and ensure production-grade reliability for core workflows.

### Key Features
- **`AsyncMultiDocumentProcessor`**: Implement true asynchronous processing for multiple documents to significantly improve throughput.
- **`MetricsCollector`**: Integrate with Prometheus to collect and expose the 41 KGAS-specific performance and quality metrics.
- **`BackupManager`**: Implement automated, incremental, and encrypted backups for both Neo4j and SQLite data stores.
- **Performance Testing Framework**: Establish a genuine performance measurement framework to track regressions and improvements.
- **Dependency Management**: Add and verify all necessary libraries for this phase (`aiofiles`, `python-docx`, `cryptography`, `prometheus-client`, `psutil`).

### Success Criteria
- TBD
