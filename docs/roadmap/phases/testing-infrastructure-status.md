## 🧪 Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Unit Testing with DI
```python
class MyServiceTest(BaseTest):
    def test_service_functionality(self):
        # Register mock service
        mock_service = self.register_mock_service(
            'identity_service',
            IdentityServiceInterface,
            health_check=ServiceResponse(success=True, data={"status": "healthy"})
        )
        
        # Test service functionality
        service = self.get_service('identity_service')
        response = service.health_check()
        
        # Validate response
        self.assert_service_response(response, success=True)
```

### 2. Integration Testing with Mixed Services
```python
class MyIntegrationTest(IntegrationTestBase):
    async def test_workflow_integration(self):
        # Configure service mix
        self.configure_service('identity_service', use_real=True)
        self.configure_service('external_api', use_real=False)
        
        # Set up services
        await self.setup_services(service_specs)
        
        # Test workflow
        result = await self.test_service_workflow('document_processing', workflow_steps)
        
        # Validate results
        self.assertEqual(len(result['steps']), 4)
        self.assertTrue(all(step['success'] for step in result['steps']))
```

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
```python
class MyPerformanceTest(PerformanceTestBase):
    async def test_service_performance(self):
        # Register service
        self.register_real_service('identity_service', IdentityServiceAdapter)
        await self.start_services()
        
        # Benchmark method
        result = await self.benchmark_service_method(
            'identity_service',
            'create_mention',
            {'surface_form': 'Test Entity'},
            iterations=100
        )
        
        # Validate performance
        self.assertLess(result.metrics[PerformanceMetric.EXECUTION_TIME], 50.0)  # <50ms
        self.assertGreater(result.metrics[PerformanceMetric.THROUGHPUT], 10.0)  # >10 ops/sec
```

### 4. TDD Pattern Implementation
```python
class MyTDDTest(TDDTestBase):
    async def test_entity_creation_behavior(self):
        # Define behavior
        self.define_behavior("Service should create entities with proper validation")
        
        # Arrange
        test_data = self.arrange(
            surface_form="Dr. Alice Johnson",
            entity_type="PERSON",
            confidence=0.9
        )
        
        # Act
        service = await self.async_get_service('identity_service')
        result = await service.create_mention(**test_data)
        
        # Assert behavior
        self.assert_behavior(result.success, "Entity creation succeeds")
        self.assert_behavior('mention_id' in result.data, "Result contains mention ID")
```

### 5. Automated Test Execution
```python
# Run all tests
automation = TestAutomation()
report = await automation.run_all_tests()

# Run specific test types
unit_report = await automation.run_all_tests([TestType.UNIT])
integration_report = await automation.run_all_tests([TestType.INTEGRATION])

# Run tests by pattern
pattern_report = await automation.run_tests_by_pattern("identity")

# Run TDD tests with enhanced reporting
tdd_report = await automation.run_tdd_tests()
