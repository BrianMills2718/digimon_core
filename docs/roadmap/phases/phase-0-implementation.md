# Phase 0: Vertical Slice Validation

**Duration**: Week 1 (5 days)  
**Goal**: Validate and demonstrate the complete academic research pipeline working end-to-end  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete before any expansion

## Overview

Phase 0 focuses on proving that all existing components work together seamlessly to deliver academic research value. This phase validates the vertical slice and identifies any integration gaps before horizontal expansion begins.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete workflow executable through UI without errors
- [ ] Academic value demonstrated with real research papers
- [ ] LLM-ontology advantages clearly shown vs traditional NLP
- [ ] All outputs (LaTeX, BibTeX, CSV) generated correctly
- [ ] Full provenance tracking verified end-to-end
- [ ] Performance baseline established for all operations
- [ ] Integration test suite automated and passing

## Phase Structure

### Day 1-2: UI Integration Testing
**File**: [`phase-0-tasks/task-0.1-ui-integration-testing.md`](phase-0-tasks/task-0.1-ui-integration-testing.md)
- Test Streamlit interface with complete workflow
- Document all bugs and integration issues
- Establish performance baseline metrics

### Day 3-4: Academic Demonstration
**File**: [`phase-0-tasks/task-0.2-academic-demonstration.md`](phase-0-tasks/task-0.2-academic-demonstration.md)
- Create compelling research demonstration
- Compare LLM vs SpaCy extraction results
- Generate publication-ready outputs

### Day 5: Test Automation
**File**: [`phase-0-tasks/task-0.3-test-automation.md`](phase-0-tasks/task-0.3-test-automation.md)
- Implement automated end-to-end tests
- Set up CI/CD pipeline integration
- Create regression test suite

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- All 14 tools validated as functional
- Neo4j and Qdrant services running
- API keys configured (OpenAI, etc.)
- Test PDF documents available

### Required Files
- `/home/brian/Digimons/streamlit_app.py` - Main UI
- `/home/brian/Digimons/src/agents/workflow_agent.py` - Workflow orchestration
- `/home/brian/Digimons/validate_tool_inventory.py` - Tool validation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **UI-Backend Integration**: Streamlit may not handle async operations properly
2. **Performance**: Full pipeline may be too slow for interactive use
3. **Memory Usage**: Large documents could cause OOM errors

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement progress indicators for long operations
- Add document size limits initially
- Use streaming where possible

## Deliverables

1. **UI Test Report** (Day 2)
   - Bug list with priorities
   - Performance metrics
   - Integration gap analysis

2. **Academic Demo Package** (Day 4)
   - Demo script and talking points
   - Sample outputs (graphs, tables, papers)
   - Comparison metrics (LLM vs SpaCy)

3. **Automated Test Suite** (Day 5)
   - End-to-end test implementation
   - CI/CD configuration
   - Test coverage report

## Next Phase Gate

Before proceeding to Phase 1:
- [ ] All UI bugs classified (critical/major/minor)
- [ ] Academic demo successfully presented
- [ ] Automated tests achieving >80% coverage
- [ ] Performance baseline documented
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision made
