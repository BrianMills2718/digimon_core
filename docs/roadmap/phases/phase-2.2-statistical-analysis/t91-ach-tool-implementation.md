# T91: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) Tool Implementation

**Phase**: 2.2 Statistical Analysis Tools  
**Tool ID**: T91  
**Status**: PLANNED  
**Priority**: HIGH - Revolutionary for systematic theory comparison  

## Overview

Implement the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) methodology adapted from CIA techniques for academic theory evaluation. This tool provides systematic comparison of multiple theories focusing on disconfirmation rather than confirmation.

## Tool Design

### Core Functionality

```python
class T91_ACHAnalyzer(BaseTool):
    """
    Systematic theory comparison using IC-proven ACH methodology
    Adapted for academic research contexts
    """
    
    def __init__(self, service_manager: ServiceManager):
        super().__init__(service_manager)
        self.tool_id = "T91"
        self.name = "ACH Theory Competition Analyzer"
        self.category = "advanced_analytics"
        
    def execute(self, request: ToolRequest) -> ToolResult:
        """
        Execute ACH analysis on competing theories
        
        Input:
            theories: List[Theory] - Competing theories to evaluate
            evidence: List[Evidence] - Available evidence
            context: ResearchContext - Domain and research context
            
        Output:
            theory_ranking: Ranked theories by disconfirmation resistance
            evidence_matrix: Theory-evidence consistency matrix
            diagnosticity_scores: Which evidence best discriminates
            sensitivity_analysis: Critical evidence identification
        """
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Theory-Evidence Matrix Builder
```python
class TheoryEvidenceMatrix:
    """Build and manage the core ACH matrix"""
    
    def add_theory(self, theory: Theory) -> None
    def add_evidence(self, evidence: Evidence) -> None
    def assess_consistency(self, theory: Theory, evidence: Evidence) -> Consistency
    def calculate_diagnosticity(self, evidence: Evidence) -> float
```

#### 2. Disconfirmation Analyzer
```python
class DisconfirmationAnalyzer:
    """Focus on disconfirming rather than confirming evidence"""
    
    def identify_disconfirming_evidence(self, theory: Theory) -> List[Evidence]
    def calculate_disconfirmation_resistance(self, theory: Theory) -> float
    def rank_by_survivability(self, theories: List[Theory]) -> TheoryRanking
```

#### 3. Evidence Diagnosticity Calculator
```python
class DiagnosticityCalculator:
    """Identify evidence that best distinguishes between theories"""
    
    def calculate_discrimination_power(self, evidence: Evidence) -> float
    def identify_critical_evidence(self) -> List[Evidence]
    def suggest_next_evidence_collection(self) -> CollectionPriorities
```

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core ACH Engine

1. **Matrix Management**
   - Theory-evidence consistency matrix
   - Bayesian probability tracking
   - Dependency handling

2. **Consistency Assessment**
   - LLM-based consistency evaluation
   - Structured reasoning capture
   - Confidence scoring

### Week 2: Disconfirmation Logic

1. **Disconfirmation Focus**
   - Identify contradictory evidence
   - Weight disconfirming evidence appropriately
   - Resistance scoring algorithm

2. **Theory Ranking**
   - Survivability calculation
   - Sensitivity analysis
   - Confidence bounds

### Week 3: Academic Adaptations

1. **Literature Integration**
   - Import theories from papers
   - Extract evidence from sources
   - Citation network awareness

2. **Academic Output**
   - LaTeX table generation
   - Visualization exports
   - Publication-ready reports

### Week 4: Testing and Validation

1. **Scenario Testing**
   - Historical theory competitions
   - Known outcomes validation
   - Edge case handling

2. **User Studies**
   - Academic researcher feedback
   - Workflow integration testing
   - Documentation completion

## Integration Points

### With Uncertainty System (Phase 2.1)
- Use calibrated confidence scores
- Apply information value assessment
- Integrate Bayesian aggregation

### With Graph Analytics (T50-T60)
- Theory networks visualization
- Evidence flow analysis
- Citation influence mapping

### With Statistical Tools (T61-T70)
- Statistical significance of evidence
- Meta-analysis integration
- Hypothesis testing support

## Academic Use Cases

### 1. Literature Review
- Compare competing explanations systematically
- Identify critical experiments needed
- Avoid confirmation bias in review

### 2. Theory Development
- Test new theory against established ones
- Identify weaknesses in current theory
- Find anomalous evidence requiring new theories

### 3. Research Planning
- Determine most diagnostic experiments
- Prioritize evidence collection
- Justify research directions

### 4. Peer Review
- Systematic evaluation of claims
- Transparent reasoning process
- Identification of critical assumptions

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: Correctly identifies strongest theories in test cases
2. **Diagnosticity**: Successfully identifies discriminating evidence
3. **Usability**: Researchers can input theories without extensive training
4. **Transparency**: Clear explanation of rankings and reasoning
5. **Performance**: Handle 50+ theories with 100+ evidence pieces

## Configuration

```yaml
ach:
  enabled: true
  llm:
    model: "gpt-4"
    temperature: 0.0
  limits:
    max_theories: 100
    max_evidence: 1000
  output:
    formats: ["json", "latex", "markdown"]
    visualizations: ["matrix", "network", "ranking"]
  integration:
    use_calibration: true
    use_information_value: true
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic ACH**: Real-time updates as new evidence arrives
2. **Collaborative ACH**: Multi-researcher theory evaluation
3. **Automated Theory Generation**: LLM suggests missing theories
4. **Cross-Domain ACH**: Compare theories across disciplines

## Academic Impact

ACH brings intelligence-grade analytical rigor to academic theory evaluation:
- **Reduces Confirmation Bias**: Forces consideration of disconfirming evidence
- **Systematic Comparison**: All theories evaluated against all evidence
- **Transparent Process**: Clear audit trail of reasoning
- **Diagnostic Focus**: Identifies most valuable future research

This tool represents a paradigm shift in how academic theories are compared and evaluated, bringing 50+ years of IC analytical refinement to scholarly research.
