# Implementation Files Moved to Roadmap

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

As part of the architecture directory decluttering, identified and moved implementation analysis files that describe current system status, issues, and implementation progress rather than target architecture.

## Files Moved to `docs/roadmap/initiatives/`

### 1. INITIALIZATION_SEQUENCE_SPECIFICATION.md
- **Content**: Analysis of current initialization failures and proposed fixes
- **Why Moved**: Contains specific implementation issues, failure points, and current working/broken status
- **Evidence**: 
  - "Current State Analysis" section with specific failure points
  - "Current Problematic Sequence" with ✅/❌ status indicators
  - Proposed implementation code for fixes
  - Implementation debugging information

### 2. MODULE_IMPORT_RESOLUTION.md  
- **Content**: Analysis of current import failures and resolution strategies
- **Why Moved**: Documents specific current implementation problems and solutions
- **Evidence**:
  - "Current Import Failures" section with specific error messages
  - "Execution Context Analysis" of current working/failing scenarios
  - Specific import error debugging and solutions
  - Implementation strategies for current issues

## Rationale

These files were moved because they:
1. **Document current implementation status** rather than target architecture
2. **Contain specific failure analysis** with current system debugging
3. **Propose implementation fixes** for existing problems
4. **Include working/broken status indicators** (✅/❌)
5. **Focus on "how to fix current issues"** rather than "what the system should look like"

## Files Retained in Architecture

Files like `ADR_IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md` were retained because they analyze how architectural decisions cascade through the system design - this is architectural analysis of target design, not current implementation status.

## Architecture Directory Principle

After this move, the architecture directory maintains focus on:
- **Target system design** (what we're building toward)
- **Architectural decisions** (ADRs)
- **System specifications** (interfaces, contracts, patterns)
- **Design patterns and concepts** (reusable architectural knowledge)

Implementation status, current issues, and debugging information belongs in:
- **`docs/roadmap/`** - Current progress and implementation status
- **`docs/development/`** - Implementation guides and procedures
- **Issue tracking systems** - Specific bugs and implementation tasks

## Result

The architecture directory now contains only documents that define the target system design, making it easier to:
- Understand the intended system architecture
- Make architectural decisions based on target design
- Distinguish between "what we want" (architecture) and "where we are" (roadmap)
- Find relevant architectural guidance without implementation noise

This separation improves architectural clarity while preserving all implementation analysis in the appropriate roadmap location.
