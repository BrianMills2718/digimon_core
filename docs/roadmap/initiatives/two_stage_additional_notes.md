## 1. System Integration

### Infrastructure Integration Patterns

**Digital Humanities Standards**
- Digital research infrastructures divide into four categories: large equipment, IT infrastructure, social infrastructure, and information infrastructure
- XML-based annotation formats are preferred for research data curation (TEI Guidelines, DocBook)
- Standardized APIs and formats are increasingly favored over proprietary in-house development
- Mixed approach to open standards vs. proprietary formats, with seven surveyed institutes using proprietary formats while four aim for standard formats

**Database and Storage Integration**
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** pattern enables real-time tracking of data source changes
- **Broadcast pattern** for "one-way sync from one to many" - moving data from single source to multiple destinations in real-time
- **Structured qualitative research** requires systematic database use for storage, retrieval, and management of large-scale ethnographic data
- Open text-based formats should be preferred for research data curated by information infrastructure

**Multi-Site Research Integration**
- Methods for integrating qualitative data across diverse studies and multi-site research consortia are less developed than quantitative integration
