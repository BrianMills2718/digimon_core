# Standardized Success Metrics Framework

## Overview

This document defines the standardized success metrics framework for KGAS, ensuring objective progress tracking and consistent success criteria across all phases and components. Each metric follows the SMART principles (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

## Metric Categories

### 1. Functional Metrics
Measure feature completeness and correctness.

### 2. Performance Metrics
Measure system efficiency and scalability.

### 3. Quality Metrics
Measure code quality, testing, and reliability.

### 4. Integration Metrics
Measure component integration and data flow.
