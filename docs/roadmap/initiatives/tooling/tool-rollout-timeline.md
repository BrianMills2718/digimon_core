# Detailed 121-Tool Rollout Timeline

**Status**: Living Document  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-22  
**Purpose**: Provide concrete implementation timeline for all 121 KGAS tools based on architectural dependencies

## Executive Summary

This document provides a prioritized, dependency-aware rollout plan for implementing all 121 KGAS tools. The timeline is structured to:
- Build foundational services first (critical dependencies)
- Implement tools in dependency order
- Enable early value delivery through vertical slices
- Minimize integration risks through careful sequencing

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Dependency-First Ordering
Tools are sequenced based on the dependency graph from `compatibility-matrix.md`. No tool is implemented before its dependencies.

### 2. Vertical Slice Delivery
Each phase delivers end-to-end functionality, not just isolated tools. Users can perform meaningful analysis at each phase completion.

### 3. Test-Driven Development
Each tool requires:
- Unit tests written before implementation
- Integration tests with dependent tools
- End-to-end workflow tests

### 4. Contract Validation
All tools must pass contract validation before integration (see `compatibility-matrix.md`).

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Core Service Bugs**: Would cascade to all tools
   - Mitigation: Extra testing focus on T107-T113
   - Contingency: 2-week buffer after week 4

2. **Integration Complexity**: Tools may not compose as expected
   - Mitigation: Integration tests every 4 weeks
   - Contingency: Simplified contracts if needed

3. **Performance Issues**: Full pipeline may be slow
   - Mitigation: Performance tests at each milestone
   - Contingency: Optimization sprints if needed

### Schedule Risks
1. **Dependency Delays**: Late tools block others
   - Mitigation: Parallel development where possible
   - Contingency: Mock implementations for testing

2. **Scope Creep**: Tools gain unnecessary features
   - Mitigation: Strict contract adherence
   - Contingency: Feature flags for additions

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
- All tools in phase implemented
- Unit tests: >90% coverage
- Integration tests: All passing
- Contract validation: 100% compliance
- Performance: Meeting benchmarks
- Documentation: Complete

### Overall Success Metrics
- 121 tools implemented: 100%
- End-to-end workflows: Functional
- Cross-modal analysis: Operational
- Theory integration: Working
- Performance targets: Met
- User acceptance: Validated

## Test-Driven Development Requirements

### For Each Tool Implementation
1. **Before Coding**:
   ```python
   # Write contract test first
   def test_tool_contract_compliance():
       """Verify tool meets compatibility matrix contract"""
       
   # Write unit tests for core functionality
   def test_tool_core_functionality():
       """Test the tool does what it claims"""
       
   # Write integration tests with dependencies
   def test_tool_integration():
       """Test tool works with its dependencies"""
   ```

2. **During Implementation**:
   - Run tests continuously
   - Only write code to make tests pass
   - Refactor once tests are green

3. **After Implementation**:
   - Add end-to-end workflow tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Documentation tests
