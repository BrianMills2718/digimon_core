# TDD Implementation Plan for KGAS

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the systematic integration of Test-Driven Development (TDD) across all KGAS phases, ensuring quality is built-in from the start. TDD is not an optional practice but a core architectural requirement.

## TDD Integration Timeline

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

#### Day 1-2: Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Install TDD tooling and Git hooks
- [ ] Configure CI/CD for test-first enforcement
- [ ] Set up TDD metrics dashboards
- [ ] Create test template repository

#### Day 3-4: Team Preparation
- [ ] Conduct TDD kickoff meeting
- [ ] Assign TDD champions for each phase
- [ ] Distribute TDD resources and guides
- [ ] Schedule paired programming sessions

#### Day 5: Baseline Establishment
- [ ] Audit existing test coverage
- [ ] Identify tools lacking tests
- [ ] Create TDD compliance report
- [ ] Set up tracking systems

### Phase 7 TDD Requirements

#### Service Architecture TDD Plan

**Week 1-2: Service Contracts**
```python
# MUST write contract tests FIRST
class TestServiceContract:
    def test_identity_service_contract(self):
        """Define expected behavior before implementation"""
        service = IdentityService()
        
        # Contract: Service must initialize
        assert service.health_check() == {"status": "healthy"}
        
        # Contract: Core operations
        result = service.resolve_entity("Apple", "tech company")
        assert result["entity_id"] is not None
        assert result["confidence"] > 0.8
```

**Week 3-4: Tool Migration Batch 1 (30 tools)**
- Write migration tests FIRST
- Define performance benchmarks
- Create integration test suites
- Validate against contracts

**Week 5-6: Tool Migration Batch 2 (45 tools)**
- Continue test-first approach
- Add cross-tool integration tests
- Performance regression tests
- Contract compliance validation

**Week 7-8: Tool Migration Batch 3 (46 tools)**
- Complete migration tests
- Full integration test suite
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Performance validation

### Phase 8 TDD Requirements

#### External Integration TDD Plan

**API Integration Tests (Write First)**
```python
class TestOpenAIIntegration:
    def test_api_contract(self):
        """Define expected API behavior"""
        # Test with mock first
        mock_api = MockOpenAI()
        result = mock_api.complete("test prompt")
        
        assert result["status"] == "success"
        assert "completion" in result
        assert result["tokens_used"] > 0
    
    def test_circuit_breaker(self):
        """Define failure handling before implementation"""
        api = OpenAIService(circuit_breaker=True)
        
        # Simulate failures
        for _ in range(5):
            api.fail()
        
        # Circuit should open
        assert api.circuit_state == "open"
        assert api.use_fallback == True
```

**Fallback Behavior Tests**
```python
def test_llm_fallback_cascade(self):
    """Define fallback behavior first"""
    service = LLMService()
    
    # Primary fails
    service.openai.fail()
    result = service.complete("test")
    
    # Should cascade to secondary
    assert result["provider"] == "anthropic"
    assert result["status"] == "success"
    
    # Both fail
    service.anthropic.fail()
    result = service.complete("test")
    
    # Should use local model
    assert result["provider"] == "local"
    assert result["degraded"] == True
```

## Tool-Specific TDD Templates

### Standard Tool TDD Template
```python
# tests/unit/test_tXXX_tool_name.py

class TestTXXXToolName:
    """TDD for Tool XXX - Write these tests FIRST"""
    
    # 1. Contract Tests (MANDATORY)
    def test_input_contract(self):
        """Tool accepts valid inputs"""
        tool = TXXXToolName()
        valid_input = {...}  # Define valid input
        result = tool.execute(valid_input)
        assert result["status"] in ["success", "error"]
    
    def test_output_contract(self):
        """Tool produces expected outputs"""
        tool = TXXXToolName()
        result = tool.execute(valid_input)
        
        # Define expected output structure
        assert "data" in result or "error" in result
        assert result.get("tool_id") == "TXXX"
        assert result.get("confidence") is not None
    
    # 2. Core Functionality (MANDATORY)
    def test_primary_function(self):
        """Tool performs its main purpose"""
        # Write test for main functionality
        # This test MUST fail initially
        
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        """Tool handles edge cases"""
        # Define edge case handling
        
    # 3. Integration Tests (MANDATORY)
    def test_service_integration(self):
        """Tool integrates with required services"""
        # Test service connections
        
    # 4. Performance Tests (MANDATORY)
    @pytest.mark.performance
    def test_performance_requirements(self):
        """Tool meets performance targets"""
        # Define performance expectations
```

### Service TDD Template
```python
# tests/unit/test_service_name.py

class TestServiceName:
    """TDD for Service - Write FIRST"""
    
    def test_service_initialization(self):
        """Service initializes correctly"""
        # Define initialization requirements
        
    def test_concurrent_access(self):
        """Service handles concurrent requests"""
        # Define concurrency behavior
        
    def test_resource_management(self):
        """Service manages resources properly"""
        # Define resource lifecycle
```

## TDD Compliance Tracking

### Daily TDD Metrics
```yaml
tdd_metrics:
  daily:
    - tests_written_first: count
    - red_green_cycles: count
    - coverage_change: percentage
    - test_execution_time: seconds
    
  weekly:
    - tdd_compliance_rate: percentage
    - test_quality_score: rating
    - refactoring_frequency: count
    - test_maintenance_time: hours
```

### TDD Dashboard Components
1. **Test-First Compliance**: Real-time tracking
2. **Coverage Trends**: Daily coverage changes
3. **Test Execution Speed**: Performance metrics
4. **Red-Green-Refactor Cycles**: Development patterns
5. **Test Quality Metrics**: Clarity, independence, completeness

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Git Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check for test files
for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only | grep "^src/"); do
    test_file=$(echo $file | sed 's/^src/tests/; s/.py$/_test.py/')
    if [ ! -f "$test_file" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: No test found for $file"
        echo "Write tests FIRST!"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Check test was modified before source
    test_time=$(git log -1 --format=%ct -- "$test_file")
    src_time=$(git log -1 --format=%ct -- "$file")
    
    if [ "$src_time" -lt "$test_time" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Test must be written before code!"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

### CI/CD Gates
```yaml
tdd_gates:
  pull_request:
    - test_coverage: ">= 95%"
    - test_first_compliance: "100%"
    - contract_tests: "all passing"
    - performance_tests: "meet benchmarks"
    
  merge_to_main:
    - all_tests_passing: true
    - coverage_increased: true
    - tdd_review_approved: true
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Common TDD Risks
1. **Initial Slowdown**: Mitigated by training and pairing
2. **Test Maintenance**: Addressed by good test design
3. **Over-Testing**: Prevented by focusing on behavior
4. **Under-Testing**: Caught by coverage requirements

### Contingency Plans
- If TDD adoption is slow: Increase pairing sessions
- If tests are low quality: Mandatory test reviews
- If coverage drops: Block deployments
- If tests are slow: Invest in test optimization

## Continuous Improvement

### Monthly TDD Retrospectives
- What's working well?
- What's challenging?
- How can we improve?
- What tools/training needed?

### Quarterly TDD Audits
- Test quality assessment
- Coverage analysis
- Performance review
- Best practices update

This plan ensures TDD becomes an integral part of KGAS development culture, improving quality, confidence, and maintainability across all phases.
