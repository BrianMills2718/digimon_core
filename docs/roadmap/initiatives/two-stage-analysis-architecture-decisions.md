# Two-Stage Analysis Architecture: Decisions, Insights, and Uncertainties

**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Context**: Testing two-stage approach (theory schema structures data ‚Üí analytic prompt evaluates) with Carter SIT analysis  
**Status**: Key architectural decisions made, implementation details to be refined

## üéØ **Core Architecture Decisions**

### **Decision 1: Two-Stage Separation**
**Approach**: Separate comprehensive data structuring (Stage 1) from analytic evaluation (Stage 2)
- **Stage 1**: Apply theory schema to structure ALL theory-relevant content without filtering
- **Stage 2**: Apply analytic questions to the structured data

**Rationale**: Prevents premature filtering that eliminates theoretically sophisticated patterns
**Evidence**: Carter analysis captured strategic identity work that direct analysis missed
**Status**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - approach successfully revealed insights missed by integrated analysis

### **Decision 2: Universal Applicability Measurement**
**Approach**: Single, universal definition of applicability applied across all theories via LLM intelligence
- **Definition**: "Applicability measures how much of the text's content relates to the theory's core concepts, mechanisms, and processes. Score 0-1 based on density, centrality, and theoretical relevance."
- **Implementation**: LLM applies this definition flexibly to any theory's specific concepts
- **Benefit**: Enables cross-theory applicability comparison (SIT: 0.85 vs Contact Theory: 0.72)

**Rationale**: Cross-theory research requires consistent metrics; LLM intelligence eliminates need for theory-specific rules
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DECIDED** - universal definition with LLM flexible application

### **Decision 3: Explicit vs Implicit Measurement**
**Approach**: Explicit applicability scores and reasoning in discourse schema
```json
{
  "theory_applicability_score": 0.85,
  "applicability_reasoning": "High density of core concepts...",
  "structured_content": {...}
}
```
**Rationale**: Clear, actionable information rather than requiring inference from structure density
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DECIDED** - explicit measurement preferred

### **Decision 4: Theory-Compatible Alternative Interpretations**
**Approach**: Include alternative interpretations that remain relevant to theory concepts
- **Good**: "Genuine identity vs strategic pandering" (both SIT-relevant)
- **Bad**: "Maybe talking about weather" (not theory-relevant)
**Implementation**: Configurable parameter - can be turned on/off as needed
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DECIDED** - theory-compatible alternatives with configurability

### **Decision 5: Comprehensive Definition via LLM Intelligence**
**Approach**: "Comprehensive = everything the LLM considers relevant to the theory schema's concepts, relations, and operationalizations"
- **Boundary**: Theory schema ontology defines relevance scope
- **Process**: LLM applies schema comprehensively without applicability filtering
- **Quality**: Consistency comes from schema adherence, not perfect replication
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DECIDED** - LLM-based comprehensive extraction within schema bounds

## üîç **Key Insights Discovered**

### **Insight 1: Delayed Evaluation Prevents Theoretical Impoverishment**
**Finding**: Separating structuring from evaluation allows capture of sophisticated theoretical patterns
**Evidence**: Carter's "constructive outgroup enhancement" and "identity cascade architecture" missed by direct analysis
**Implication**: Integration of evaluation with structuring causes premature filtering

### **Insight 2: Theoretical Sophistication Requires Rich Foundations**
**Finding**: Complex communications need comprehensive structural mapping before analytic questions
**Evidence**: Carter's strategic identity work only visible through complete SIT mapping
**Implication**: Simple pattern-matching insufficient for sophisticated theoretical phenomena

### **Insight 3: Reusability Transforms Efficiency Calculus**
**Finding**: Higher upfront structuring cost pays off through multiple analytic uses
**Evidence**: Same Carter SIT structure could answer multiple research questions, enable comparative analysis
**Implication**: Investment in structured data infrastructure rather than one-off analysis

### **Insight 4: Configurability Enables Flexible Rigor**
**Finding**: Optional components (justifications, alternatives, confidence) allow appropriate rigor levels
**Evidence**: Simple applications don't need full apparatus; complex research benefits from transparency
**Implication**: Single framework serves diverse research needs through configuration

## üìã **Implementation Decisions**

### **Meta-Schema v11+ Requirements**
1. **Universal Applicability Framework**: All theory schemas must support applicability measurement using universal definition
2. **Configurable Components**: Optional justifications, alternative interpretations, confidence scores
3. **Comprehensive Extraction Mandate**: Stage 1 must extract all theory-relevant content without evaluation filtering
4. **Explicit Measurement**: Discourse schemas include explicit scores and reasoning, not just implicit structure

### **Theory Schema Requirements**
1. **Ontology Completeness**: Must define all concepts, relations, operationalizations for comprehensive extraction
2. **LLM-Compatible**: Definitions must be interpretable by frontier LLMs for flexible application
3. **Cross-Theory Consistency**: Use meta-schema standards for applicability, confidence, alternatives

### **Discourse Schema Structure**
```json
{
  "theory_applicability_score": "number 0-1",
  "applicability_reasoning": "string explanation",
  "theory_structured_content": "comprehensive mapping",
  "optional_components": {
    "justifications": "if configured",
    "alternative_interpretations": "if configured", 
    "confidence_scores": "if configured"
  }
}
```

## ‚ùì **Remaining Uncertainties**

### **Uncertainty 1: Optimal Granularity for Applicability**
**Question**: Should applicability be:
- **Single score**: Overall theory applicability (0.85)
- **Component scores**: Per-mechanism applicability (categorization: 0.9, identification: 0.8, comparison: 0.7)
- **Both**: Overall + breakdown
**Impact**: Affects diagnostic capability and cross-theory comparison
**Status**: üü° **UNRESOLVED** - need empirical testing

### **Uncertainty 2: Quality Control Mechanisms**
**Question**: How to ensure consistent, high-quality comprehensive extraction?
**Options**:
- Inter-analyst reliability testing
- Systematic completeness checklists  
- Automated quality metrics
- Post-hoc validation processes
**Impact**: Affects reliability and scientific credibility
**Status**: üü° **UNRESOLVED** - need systematic approach

### **Uncertainty 3: Scalability and Performance**
**Question**: How does comprehensive extraction scale to:
- **Long documents**: Multi-hour speeches, books, transcripts
- **Multiple documents**: Comparative studies, longitudinal analysis
- **Real-time analysis**: Live event processing
**Impact**: Affects practical applicability and resource requirements
**Status**: üü° **UNRESOLVED** - need performance testing

### **Uncertainty 4: Cross-Theory Integration**
**Question**: How to handle texts relevant to multiple theories simultaneously?
**Options**:
- **Sequential application**: Apply each theory schema separately
- **Integrated schemas**: Combine compatible theories into unified schema
- **Hierarchical analysis**: Primary theory + secondary theory perspectives
**Impact**: Affects interdisciplinary research capability
**Status**: üü° **UNRESOLVED** - need architectural design

### **Uncertainty 5: Validation Against Ground Truth**
**Question**: How to validate that LLM applicability judgments and comprehensive extractions are accurate?
**Challenges**:
- No objective "ground truth" for interpretive social science
- Expert consensus as validation standard?
- Predictive validity testing?
**Impact**: Affects scientific legitimacy and adoption
**Status**: üü° **UNRESOLVED** - need validation framework

## üéØ **Next Steps for Architecture Development**

### **Immediate (Next Phase)**
1. **Implement universal applicability** in meta-schema v11.1
