# Meta-Schema System: Planning, Decisions, and Implementation Strategy

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Status**: Comprehensive planning document for automated theory extraction and application system  
**Context**: Integration of meta-schema design with automated paper extraction workflow

## üéØ **Core System Vision**

### **Primary Workflow**
```
Academic Paper ‚Üí Auto-Extraction ‚Üí Theory Meta-Schema ‚Üí Text Analysis ‚Üí Theoretical Insights
```

**Key Principle**: Theory schemas are **automatically generated** from academic papers using sophisticated meta-prompts, not manually created by theory implementers.

### **Two-Stage Analysis Architecture (Validated)**
1. **Stage 1**: Comprehensive theory-based structuring (extract ALL relevant content)
2. **Stage 2**: Analytic evaluation of structured data (answer research questions)

**Rationale**: Prevents premature filtering that eliminates theoretically sophisticated patterns (validated through Carter SIT analysis).

## üìã **Critical Design Decisions**

### **Decision 1: Universal Cross-Theory Standards**

**Problem Identified**: Auto-generated schemas from different papers create incompatible formats that prevent cross-theory comparison.

**Solution**: Meta-schema enforces universal standards while preserving theory-specific content.

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "universal_applicability": {
    "definition": "Standard across all theories: density √ó centrality √ó theoretical_relevance (0-1)",
    "theory_specific_indicators": ["extracted from individual papers"],
    "measurement_approach": "consistent calculation method"
  },
  "evidence_grading": {
    "strong/moderate/weak/absent": "standardized categories",
    "theory_specific_criteria": "from paper extraction"
  },
  "analysis_output": {
    "standardized_structure": "enables cross-theory comparison",
    "theory_specific_insights": "preserves theoretical uniqueness"
  }
}
```

### **Decision 2: Paper Selection Criteria (Revised)**

**Initial Assessment**: Too restrictive categorization of "poor papers"

**Revised Understanding**:

#### **Excellent Sources**:
- **Original Theory Papers**: Foundational works with explicit frameworks
- **Major Review Papers**: Comprehensive syntheses with clear theoretical integration
- **Theoretical Extensions**: Papers that meaningfully extend existing theories

#### **Good Sources**:
- **Empirical Studies with Strong Theoretical Frameworks**: Variables = operationalized concepts, hypotheses = theoretical relationships
- **Meta-Analyses with Theoretical Integration**: Can generate unified schemas OR multiple competing schemas
- **Applied Papers with Theoretical Contributions**: Adaptations/extensions for new contexts
- **Methodological Papers**: If they embed theoretical assumptions about phenomena

#### **Challenging Sources** (not necessarily "poor"):
- **Purely Descriptive Studies**: May lack theoretical structure but could provide taxonomies
- **Atheoretical Empirical Work**: Limited theoretical content but may have implicit frameworks
- **Opinion/Commentary Pieces**: May contain theoretical insights but less systematic

#### **Unsuitable Sources**:
- **Pure Data Reports**: No theoretical content
- **Technical Documentation**: No social science theory
- **Journalistic Pieces**: Lack theoretical rigor

**Key Insight**: Almost any academic paper has some theoretical structure - the question is whether it's explicit enough for reliable extraction.

### **Decision 3: Meta-Schema Structure (v11.1 Validated)**

**Core Architecture**:
```json
{
  "process_type": "two_stage_analysis",
  "stage_1_structuring": {
    "constraint": "no_evaluation_filtering",
    "universal_applicability_measurement": "enforced standard",
    "comprehensive_extraction": "ALL theory-relevant content"
  },
  "stage_2_evaluation": {
    "structured_data_analysis": "operates on Stage 1 output",
    "configurable_rigor": "optional components based on research needs"
  }
}
```

**Validation**: Successfully implemented Elaboration Likelihood Model, proving practical usability.

### **Decision 4: MCL Integration Strategy**

**Current Status**: MCL (Master Concept Library) identified as powerful enhancement but **deferred** to focus on core meta-schema first.

**MCL Vision**: Universal concept mapping layer enabling:
- Single extraction ‚Üí multiple theory applications
- Cross-theory concept alignment
- Theoretical gap identification

**Integration Plan**: Make meta-schema MCL-ready (optional `mcl_id` fields) without requiring MCL implementation.

### **Decision 5: Automated Prompt Generation**

**Workflow**: Academic Paper ‚Üí Meta-Prompt ‚Üí Theory Schema
```
Phase 1: High-Level Analysis & Classification
Phase 2: Deep Ontological Extraction  
Phase 3: Formal & Procedural Extraction
```

**Quality Control**:
- Fidelity Check: Preserve author's exact language
- Classification Check: Accurate structural categorization
- Abstraction Check: Remove specific examples, preserve patterns
- Completeness Check: Capture all major theoretical components

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Test Case 1: Young's Cognitive Mapping (In Progress)**
- **Paper**: Cognitive mapping with Carter speech application
- **Goal**: Validate meta-schema with complex theoretical framework
- **Success Criteria**: Extract cognitive mapping methodology and apply to Carter speech

### **Test Case 2: Cross-Theory Comparison**
- **Goal**: Validate universal standards enable comparison
- **Method**: Extract 2-3 theories, apply to same text, compare applicability scores

### **Test Case 3: Complex Theory Extraction**
- **Goal**: Test limits of automated extraction
