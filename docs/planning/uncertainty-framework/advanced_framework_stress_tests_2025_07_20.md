# Advanced Uncertainty Framework Stress Tests

## Stress Test 1: Mixed Human/AI-Generated QAnon Discourse Analysis
**Scenario**: Analyzing a QAnon forum thread where some posts are human-generated and others are AI-generated bot posts

### The Challenge
```
Thread: "The Deep State's COVID Cover-Up Exposed"
- 50 posts total
- Mix of authentic human conspiracy theorists and AI-generated amplification bots
- Need to: Extract conspiracy networks, assess claim credibility, track influence patterns
```

### Advanced Framework Application

#### Step 1: Proactive Competence Assessment (Meta-Learning)
```python
# NEW: Assess competence before analysis begins
competence_estimator = DiscourseCompetenceEstimator()
domain_assessment = competence_estimator.assess_competence_before_analysis(thread_sample)

result = {
    "domain": "qanon_covid_conspiracy",
    "expected_accuracy": 0.68,  # Lower than mainstream discourse
    "confidence_calibration_factor": 0.75,  # Adjust confidence down
    "known_challenges": ["coded_language", "dog_whistles", "insider_references"],
    "recommended_uncertainty_boost": 0.20
}
```

**Framework Success**: Proactively identifies that model competence is lower for QAnon discourse than mainstream political discourse.

#### Step 2: Meta-Epistemic Uncertainty (Authenticity Detection)
```python
# NEW: Assess authenticity for each post
authenticity_assessments = []
for post in thread_posts:
    auth_assessment = AuthenticityDetector().assess(post)
    authenticity_assessments.append({
        "post_id": post.id,
        "human_generated_prob": 0.65,  # Uncertain
        "ai_generated_prob": 0.35,
        "detection_confidence": 0.55,   # Low confidence in detection
        "indicators": ["repetitive_phrasing", "unusual_posting_pattern", "generic_conspiracy_language"]
    })
```

**Framework Success**: Identifies uncertain authenticity rather than assuming all posts are human-generated.

#### Step 3: Adaptive Computation Architecture
```python
# NEW: Dynamic resource allocation based on authenticity uncertainty
uncertainty_processor = AdaptiveUncertaintyProcessor()

for post in thread_posts:
    # Fast screening first
    initial_assessment = uncertainty_processor.compute_uncertainty(post, level="fast")
    
    if post.authenticity_uncertainty > 0.4:  # High authenticity uncertainty
        # Use deeper computation for questionable posts
        final_assessment = uncertainty_processor.compute_uncertainty(post, level="deep")
    elif post.contains_novel_conspiracy_terms():  # Novel discourse patterns
        final_assessment = uncertainty_processor.compute_uncertainty(post, level="medium")
    else:
        final_assessment = initial_assessment  # Keep fast assessment
```

**Framework Success**: Allocates expensive deep analysis only to posts with high authenticity uncertainty or novel patterns.

#### Step 4: Authenticity-Adjusted Discourse Analysis
```python
# NEW: Propagate authenticity uncertainty through analysis
discourse_analyzer = DiscourseAnalysisWithAuthenticity()

conspiracy_network = {}
for post in thread_posts:
    analysis = discourse_analyzer.analyze_post(post.text)
    
    # Adjust confidence based on authenticity uncertainty
    authenticity_adjusted_confidence = combine_uncertainties(
        analysis.confidence,  # Base analysis confidence
        post.authenticity_uncertainty.detection_confidence,
        post.authenticity_uncertainty.human_generated_prob
    )
    
    conspiracy_network[post.id] = {
        "entities": analysis.entities,
        "claims": analysis.conspiracy_claims,
        "base_confidence": analysis.confidence,
        "authenticity_adjusted_confidence": authenticity_adjusted_confidence,
        "authenticity_flags": post.authenticity_uncertainty
    }
```

**Result**: Network analysis with explicit authenticity uncertainty:
```python
network_summary = {
    "total_posts": 50,
    "high_authenticity_confidence": 25,  # 50% clearly human
    "low_authenticity_confidence": 15,   # 30% likely AI-generated
    "uncertain_authenticity": 10,        # 20% unknown
    "conspiracy_claims_adjusted": {
        "covid_lab_origin": {"confidence": [0.4, 0.7], "authenticity_impact": 0.15},
        "deep_state_control": {"confidence": [0.2, 0.5], "authenticity_impact": 0.25}
    }
}
```

### Issues Revealed

**Problem**: **Authenticity Uncertainty Propagation Complexity**
When 30% of posts might be AI-generated, how do we aggregate claims across the thread?

```python
# Challenge: Should AI-generated posts be weighted differently?
claim_aggregation = {
    "covid_lab_origin": {
        "human_posts_support": 15,  # High weight
        "ai_posts_support": 8,      # Lower weight? Zero weight?
        "uncertain_posts_support": 5  # How to weight?
    }
}
```

**Framework Gap**: No principled method for weighting claims based on authenticity uncertainty in aggregation.

## Stress Test 2: Rapidly Evolving Discourse Pattern (Russia-Ukraine Narrative)
**Scenario**: Tracking how conspiracy narratives about Ukraine evolve across 6 months

### The Challenge
```
Timeline: Feb 2022 - Aug 2022
Initial Narrative: "Ukraine is Nazi regime"
Evolved Narrative: "Ukraine is US bioweapons lab" 
Final Narrative: "Ukraine war is distraction from COVID origins"
Task: Track narrative evolution and assess current model competence
```

### Advanced Framework Application

#### Step 1: Domain Competence Assessment Over Time
```python
# NEW: Track competence degradation as discourse evolves
competence_tracker = TemporalCompetenceTracker()

feb_assessment = competence_tracker.assess_competence("ukraine_nazi_narrative")
# Result: expected_accuracy=0.75 (familiar conspiracy pattern)

aug_assessment = competence_tracker.assess_competence("ukraine_bioweapons_covid_distraction")
# Result: expected_accuracy=0.45 (novel hybrid narrative)

competence_decay = {
    "initial_competence": 0.75,
    "current_competence": 0.45,
    "degradation_rate": 0.05_per_month,
    "reason": "narrative_hybridization_beyond_training_patterns"
}
```

**Framework Success**: Detects that model competence has degraded as discourse evolved beyond training patterns.

#### Step 2: Recursive Cognitive Refinement for Complex Patterns
```python
# NEW: Use iterative self-correction for complex evolved narrative
recursive_analyzer = RecursiveDiscourseRefinement()

initial_analysis = recursive_analyzer.analyze_discourse(ukraine_posts)
# Initial: Identifies separate conspiracies (Nazi, bioweapons, COVID)

challenges = recursive_analyzer.generate_challenges(initial_analysis)
# Challenges: "How do Nazi claims relate to bioweapons claims?"
#            "Is COVID distraction consistent with bioweapons narrative?"

refined_analysis = recursive_analyzer.refine_analysis(initial_analysis, challenges)
# Refined: Recognizes hybrid narrative structure combining multiple conspiracies

final_confidence = 0.35  # Lower due to novel complexity
```

**Framework Success**: Self-correction identifies hybrid narrative structure that initial analysis missed.

#### Step 3: Temporal Uncertainty with Non-Stationary Learning
```python
# Challenge: Historical training data no longer applies
temporal_validity = {
    "feb_2022_patterns": {
        "validity_window": [2014, 2022],  # Ukraine crisis patterns
        "confidence_in_current_context": 0.6  # Still somewhat relevant
    },
    "aug_2022_patterns": {
        "validity_window": [2022, None],   # New hybrid patterns
        "confidence_in_current_context": 0.3  # Very uncertain
    }
}

# Adaptive time windows based on narrative evolution speed
time_window_config = {
    "stable_narratives": "6_months",
    "evolving_narratives": "2_weeks",   # Very short for rapid evolution
    "hybrid_narratives": "1_week"       # Extremely short
}
```

**Framework Success**: Adapts time windows to rapid narrative evolution.

### Issues Revealed

**Problem**: **Non-Stationary Competence Estimation**
How do we estimate competence for narratives that didn't exist during meta-learning training?

```python
# Meta-learning was trained on known conspiracy types:
known_types = ["covid_denial", "election_fraud", "vaccine_hesitancy"]

# But new hybrid emerges:
novel_hybrid = "ukraine_bioweapons_covid_election_fraud_combo"

# Question: How to estimate competence for unprecedented combinations?
competence_estimate = ???  # Framework has no method for this
```

**Framework Gap**: Meta-learning competence assessment fails for novel narrative combinations.

## Stress Test 3: Collective Reasoning Disagreement (Ambiguous Sarcasm)
**Scenario**: Analyzing ambiguous posts where multiple AI models disagree on interpretation

### The Challenge
```
Post: "Oh sure, I totally believe the government has our best interests at heart 🙄 
       Just like they did with MKUltra, WMDs, and Tuskegee..."

Question: Is this sarcastic criticism or sincere conspiracy belief?
```

### Advanced Framework Application

#### Step 1: Collective Reasoning Framework
```python
# NEW: Use multiple models for consensus
collective_reasoner = CollectiveReasoningFramework()

model_interpretations = {
    "claude": {
        "sarcasm_detected": 0.85,
        "government_distrust": 0.90,
        "conspiracy_belief": 0.25,
        "interpretation": "sarcastic_criticism_not_conspiracy"
    },
    "gpt4": {
        "sarcasm_detected": 0.60,
        "government_distrust": 0.95,
        "conspiracy_belief": 0.70,
        "interpretation": "genuine_conspiracy_belief"
    },
    "gemini": {
        "sarcasm_detected": 0.75,
        "government_distrust": 0.85,
        "conspiracy_belief": 0.45,
        "interpretation": "ambiguous_mixed_signals"
    }
}

consensus_analysis = collective_reasoner.analyze_consensus(model_interpretations)
```

#### Step 2: Consensus-Based Uncertainty Estimation
```python
consensus_result = {
    "agreement_level": 0.35,  # Low agreement between models
    "confidence_in_consensus": 0.40,  # Low due to disagreement
    "majority_interpretation": "ambiguous",
    "uncertainty_source": "fundamental_ambiguity_not_model_limitation",
    "interpretation_distribution": {
        "sarcastic_criticism": 0.4,
        "genuine_conspiracy": 0.35,
        "mixed_signals": 0.25
    }
}
```

**Framework Success**: Correctly identifies fundamental ambiguity rather than claiming false confidence.

#### Step 3: Meta-Evaluation of Uncertainty Quality
```python
# NEW: Evaluate uncertainty quality by downstream utility
meta_evaluator = UncertaintyMetaEvaluator()

# Test: Does uncertainty help with misclassification detection?
uncertainty_utility = meta_evaluator.test_downstream_utility(
    predictions=model_interpretations,
    uncertainties=consensus_result,
    task="sarcasm_detection"
)

utility_assessment = {
    "selective_prediction_improvement": 0.15,  # 15% accuracy gain when abstaining on high uncertainty
    "misprediction_detection_auc": 0.72,      # Moderate ability to detect errors
    "ood_detection_performance": 0.68,        # Moderate OOD detection
    "overall_utility_score": 0.71
}
```

**Framework Success**: Shows uncertainty estimates are moderately useful for downstream decisions.

### Issues Revealed

**Problem**: **Collective Reasoning Computational Cost**
Using 3+ models for every ambiguous case is computationally expensive.

```python
# Cost analysis:
standard_analysis = {"cost": 1, "time": 100_ms}
collective_reasoning = {"cost": 4, "time": 400_ms}  # 4x increase

# When to trigger collective reasoning?
trigger_conditions = {
    "initial_confidence < 0.6": True,   # Low confidence
    "novel_discourse_pattern": True,   # Unknown patterns
    "high_stakes_analysis": True       # Important decisions
}

# Problem: 60% of discourse posts might meet these conditions
# Cost explosion: 4x for majority of analyses
```

**Framework Gap**: Need more sophisticated triggering conditions to avoid cost explosion.

## Stress Test 4: Echo Chamber Correlation with Authenticity Uncertainty
**Scenario**: Analyzing anti-vaccine community where bot amplification creates artificial consensus

### The Challenge
```
Community: 1000 anti-vaccine accounts
Reality: 300 human accounts + 700 coordinated bot accounts
Observed: High consensus on vaccine dangers (95% negative sentiment)
Question: How much is genuine belief vs artificial amplification?
```

### Advanced Framework Application

#### Step 1: Authenticity-Aware Community Detection
```python
# Standard approach would see high consensus
naive_analysis = {
    "community_sentiment": -0.85,  # Strongly negative
    "consensus_level": 0.95,       # Very high agreement
    "confidence": 0.90             # High confidence in measurement
}

# NEW: Authenticity-aware analysis
authenticity_aware_analysis = CommunityAnalysisWithAuthenticity()

member_authenticity = {}
for user in community_members:
    auth_score = authenticity_detector.assess_user_pattern(user)
    member_authenticity[user.id] = {
        "human_prob": auth_score.human_prob,
        "bot_prob": auth_score.bot_prob,
        "detection_confidence": auth_score.confidence
    }
```

#### Step 2: Correlation-Aware Aggregation with Authenticity Weighting
```python
# NEW: Weight opinions by authenticity and account for bot correlation
weighted_aggregator = AuthenticityAwareAggregator()

sentiment_analysis = {
    "naive_consensus": -0.85,  # Treats all opinions equally
    "authenticity_weighted": {
        "human_only_sentiment": -0.65,      # Less extreme when bots excluded
        "human_confidence": [0.55, 0.75],   # Wide range due to fewer data points
        "bot_amplification_factor": 0.25,   # Bots amplified consensus
        "genuine_vs_artificial": {
            "genuine_belief": 0.65,
            "artificial_amplification": 0.35
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Echo Chamber Detection with Authenticity Adjustment
```python
# Detect echo chamber effects adjusted for bot presence
echo_chamber_analysis = {
    "apparent_homophily": 0.95,      # Looks like strong echo chamber
    "authenticity_adjusted": {
        "human_homophily": 0.75,      # Still echo chamber but less extreme
        "bot_coordination": 0.90,     # Bots are highly coordinated
        "organic_vs_artificial": {
            "organic_consensus": 0.75,
            "artificial_consensus": 0.25
        }
    }
}
```

**Framework Success**: Distinguishes between genuine community beliefs and artificial amplification.

### Issues Revealed

**Problem**: **Authenticity Detection Accuracy Requirements**
If bot detection is only 70% accurate, how does this propagate through analysis?

```python
# Bot detection uncertainty propagation
detection_errors = {
    "false_positives": 0.15,  # 15% humans labeled as bots
    "false_negatives": 0.20,  # 20% bots labeled as humans
    "impact_on_sentiment": {
        "underestimate_bot_influence": "when false negatives high",
        "overestimate_human_diversity": "when false positives high"
    }
}

# Sensitivity analysis needed:
# How much does 20% bot detection error affect final conclusions?
sensitivity_analysis = "FRAMEWORK GAP - not implemented"
```

**Framework Gap**: No sensitivity analysis for authenticity detection errors.

## Overall Framework Assessment

### Successes ✅
1. **Proactive Competence Assessment** successfully identifies domain-specific limitations
2. **Authenticity Uncertainty Propagation** correctly adjusts confidence for synthetic content
3. **Adaptive Computation** efficiently allocates resources based on uncertainty
4. **Collective Reasoning** identifies fundamental ambiguity vs model limitations
5. **Recursive Refinement** improves analysis of complex evolved patterns

### Remaining Gaps ❌
1. **Authenticity Aggregation Weighting**: No principled method for weighting claims by authenticity
2. **Novel Hybrid Competence**: Meta-learning fails for unprecedented narrative combinations
3. **Collective Reasoning Cost Management**: Expensive without sophisticated triggering
4. **Authenticity Detection Sensitivity**: No error propagation analysis for detection failures

### Key Insight
The advanced framework handles most uncertainty challenges but struggles with **second-order uncertainty** - uncertainty about the uncertainty estimates themselves. This includes:
- Uncertainty about authenticity detection accuracy
- Uncertainty about competence estimates for novel patterns
- Uncertainty about when to trigger expensive collective reasoning

These meta-uncertainty challenges represent the next frontier for framework development.
