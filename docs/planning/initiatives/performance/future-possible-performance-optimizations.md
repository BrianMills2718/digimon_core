# Future Possible Performance Optimizations

> **Note**: Performance is NOT a current priority. Focus is on 100% reliability and error recovery.
> This document captures optimization ideas for future consideration.

## Current Performance Baseline
- **With PageRank**: 54.0s per document
- **Without PageRank**: 7.55s per document
- **Bottlenecks Identified**:
  - PageRank: 47.45s (86% of total time)
  - Edge Building: 4-5s (9% of total time)
  - Entity Extraction: 0.6s
  - Relationship Extraction: 0.77s

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Query-Time PageRank (Highest Impact)
**Potential Speedup**: 40-45s reduction
- Calculate PageRank only on query-relevant subgraph
- Use BFS from query entities to limit graph size
- Cache PageRank scores per subgraph
- Implementation: Modify `t68_pagerank.py` to accept entity filters

### 2. Batch Neo4j Operations
**Potential Speedup**: 2-3s reduction
- Current: Individual CREATE statements for each edge
- Optimization: Use UNWIND for batch operations
- Batch size: 500-1000 operations per transaction
- Implementation: Modify `t31_entity_builder.py` and `t34_edge_builder.py`

### 3. Parallel Chunk Processing
**Potential Speedup**: 0.5-1s reduction
- Current: Sequential processing of chunks
- Optimization: Use multiprocessing.Pool for NER and relationship extraction
- Chunk batching: Process 4-8 chunks in parallel
- Implementation: Modify workflow to use concurrent.futures

### 4. Lazy Loading and Caching

#### 4.1 SpaCy Model Caching
- Cache loaded SpaCy model across workflow execution
- Potential savings: 0.1-0.2s per workflow

#### 4.2 Neo4j Query Result Caching
- Cache frequently accessed entities and relationships
- Use Redis or in-memory cache
- Potential savings: 0.5-1s for repeated queries

### 5. Graph Database Optimizations

#### 5.1 Index Optimization
```cypher
CREATE INDEX entity_id_idx FOR (e:Entity) ON (e.entity_id);
CREATE INDEX entity_name_idx FOR (e:Entity) ON (e.canonical_name);
CREATE INDEX entity_type_idx FOR (e:Entity) ON (e.entity_type);
```

#### 5.2 Query Optimization
- Use query profiling to identify slow queries
- Optimize Cypher queries with EXPLAIN and PROFILE
- Consider query result pagination

### 6. Asynchronous Processing

#### 6.1 Async Neo4j Operations
- Use neo4j async driver for non-blocking operations
- Overlap I/O operations with CPU-bound tasks
- Potential savings: 1-2s overall

#### 6.2 Pipeline Parallelism
- Start edge building while entity extraction continues
- Overlap PageRank calculation with query preparation
- Requires careful synchronization

### 7. Algorithmic Optimizations

#### 7.1 Approximate PageRank
- Use approximation algorithms for large graphs
- Power iteration with early termination
- Potential speedup: 10-20s for large graphs

#### 7.2 Incremental PageRank
- Update PageRank scores incrementally as edges are added
- Avoid full recalculation for document updates
- Complex implementation but significant speedup

### 8. Infrastructure Optimizations

#### 8.1 Neo4j Configuration
```
dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=2g
dbms.memory.heap.max_size=4g
dbms.memory.pagecache.size=2g
```

#### 8.2 Connection Pool Tuning
- Increase pool size for high concurrency
- Tune connection timeout and retry parameters
- Monitor pool utilization

### 9. Profiling and Monitoring

#### 9.1 Detailed Profiling
```python
import cProfile
import pstats

profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()
# ... workflow execution ...
profiler.disable()
stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
stats.print_stats(20)
```

#### 9.2 Memory Profiling
- Use memory_profiler to identify memory bottlenecks
- Optimize data structures for memory efficiency
- Consider streaming processing for large documents

### 10. Alternative Approaches

#### 10.1 Graph Sampling
- For very large graphs, use sampling techniques
- Maintain statistical properties while reducing size
- Trade accuracy for speed when appropriate

#### 10.2 Distributed Processing
- Use Apache Spark for distributed graph processing
- Distribute PageRank calculation across nodes
- Suitable for production deployments

## Implementation Priority (When Performance Becomes Important)

1. **Query-Time PageRank** - Biggest bang for buck
2. **Batch Neo4j Operations** - Easy to implement
3. **Parallel Chunk Processing** - Moderate complexity
4. **SpaCy Model Caching** - Quick win
5. **Index Optimization** - Database best practice

## Monitoring Recommendations

- Add timing metrics to each pipeline stage
- Log slow operations (>1s) for investigation
- Create performance regression tests
- Monitor Neo4j query performance

## Note on Current Optimizations

Already implemented (from F1-F3):
- ✅ Service Singleton Pattern
- ✅ Connection Pool Management
- ✅ Optimized PageRank algorithm

These provide a solid foundation but further optimizations should wait until reliability is 100%.-e
