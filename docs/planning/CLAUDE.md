# Development Roadmap (Bucket 2)

This folder hosts the single authoritative roadmap for the Digimons project.

- `ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md` located in the repository root is the master roadmap overview.
- Historic versions (`ROADMAP_v2.1.md`, `ROADMAP_v3.0.md`, etc.) have been archived and should not be edited.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Propose roadmap changes via pull request â€“ keep modifications structured by quarter / phase.  
2. Do **not** create additional roadmap files. Update the main `ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md` instead.  
3. After updating the roadmap, refresh links in the root `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md`.

### TODO for contributors

- Ensure CI passes (markdown linter and archive guard).  
- If a roadmap item becomes outdated, mark it clearly instead of deleting for historical traceability.
