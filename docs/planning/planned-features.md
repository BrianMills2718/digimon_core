# Planned Features - NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Everything in this document represents **future development goals**, not current capabilities. 

**This file is aspirational; see ROADMAP_v2.1.md for committed scope.**

**Current Reality**: See [`docs/planning/roadmap.md`](../planning/roadmap.md) for what actually works.

## üéØ Long-term Vision (Aspirational)

### Format-Agnostic Analytics (post-GraphRAG)
A system that intelligently processes diverse data sources through format-agnostic analysis, using specialized tools to dynamically select optimal data structures and enable sophisticated multi-step analytical workflows.

**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Current system only handles PDF ‚Üí Graph extraction

### 121-Tool Ecosystem (Future Goal)
Complete toolkit spanning 8 phases of data processing, from ingestion through analysis to export.

**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Currently ~23 Python files, mostly in Phase 1

## üìã Planned Tool Phases (Future Development)

### Phase 1: Ingestion (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Multi-format data loading and API connectors
- ‚úÖ **T01**: PDF Loader (working)
- ‚úÖ **T15a**: Text Chunker (working)  
- ‚ùå **T02-T12**: Other ingestion tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 2: Processing (BROKEN/INCOMPLETE)
**Goal**: NLP, entity extraction, format detection
- ‚úÖ **T23a**: spaCy NER (working in Phase 1)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **T23c**: Ontology-aware extraction (partial due to integration challenges)
- ‚ùå **T13-T30**: Other processing tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 3: Construction (STANDALONE ONLY)
**Goal**: Dynamic structure building (graphs, tables, embeddings)
- üîß **T301**: Multi-document fusion tools (standalone, not integrated)
- ‚ùå **T31-T48**: Other construction tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 4: Retrieval (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Cross-format querying and data access
- ‚ùå **T49-T67**: All retrieval tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 5: Analysis (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Format-specific algorithms (graph, statistical, vector)
- ‚ùå **T68-T75**: All analysis tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 6: Storage (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Multi-database management, backup, caching
- ‚ùå **T76-T81**: All storage tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 7: Interface (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Natural language processing, monitoring, export
- ‚ùå **T82-T106**: All interface tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 8: Core Services (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Identity, versioning, quality tracking, workflow state
- ‚úÖ **T107, T110, T111, T121**: Some core services (working)
- ‚ùå **T108, T109, T112-T120**: Other core services (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

## üåü Planned Capabilities (Future Goals)

### Format-Agnostic Processing (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision**: Accept PDFs, CSVs, APIs, databases and automatically adapt processing
**Current Reality**: Only PDF processing implemented

### Dynamic Structure Selection (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision**: AI chooses graphs for relationships, tables for statistics, vectors for similarity
**Current Reality**: Only graph extraction implemented

### Seamless Format Conversion (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision**: Tools like T115 (Graph‚ÜíTable) and T116 (Table‚ÜíGraph) enable mid-workflow format changes
**Current Reality**: No format conversion tools exist

### Multi-Format Workflows (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision Example**:
```
Research Papers (PDF) ‚Üí Text ‚Üí Entities ‚Üí Citation Graph ‚Üí PageRank ‚Üí 
Top Authors (Table) ‚Üí Statistical Analysis ‚Üí Geographic Clustering ‚Üí 
Collaboration Network (Graph) ‚Üí Community Detection ‚Üí Summary Report
```
**Current Reality**: Can only do: PDF ‚Üí Text ‚Üí Entities ‚Üí Graph

## üö® Implementation Requirements Before These Become Reality

### 1. Fix Current Integration Issues
- [ ] Resolve Phase 1‚Üí2 API compatibility problems
- [ ] Create standard phase interface contracts
- [ ] Implement automated integration testing

### 2. Build Architecture Foundation
- [ ] Service versioning strategy
- [ ] Backward compatibility layers
- [ ] UI adapter pattern for phase differences

### 3. Systematic Implementation
- [ ] Implement tools incrementally with integration testing
- [ ] Verify each tool works before documenting as "complete"
- [ ] Create real validation commands for all claims

### 4. Quality Assurance
- [ ] End-to-end testing framework
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Error handling and recovery procedures

## üìã Development Principles for Future Work

### Verification-First Implementation
```bash
# Before claiming any tool is implemented:
python -c "from src.tools.phaseX.tXX_tool import Tool; print(Tool().execute(test_input))"

# Before claiming integration works:
python test_integration.py --phase1-to-phase2

# Before updating documentation:
python verify_all_claims.py
```

### Reality-Based Progress Tracking
- **Document what exists**, not what's planned
- **Test integration** before claiming phases work together  
- **Verify UI functionality** before marking features as available
- **Separate aspirational content** from implementation claims
