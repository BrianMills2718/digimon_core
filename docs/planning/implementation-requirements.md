## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Core Services Implementation** - Blocking all other development
2. **Database Integration Complexity** - Three different systems with different consistency models
3. **Performance Bottlenecks** - Reference resolution and quality propagation at scale
4. **Error Recovery** - Complex multi-database transaction recovery

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Implement core services first** - Validate architecture early
2. **Test integration continuously** - Don't wait for full implementation
3. **Monitor performance from day one** - Identify bottlenecks early
4. **Practice failure scenarios** - Test recovery procedures regularly

This requirements document ensures that all aspects of the 121-tool system are properly planned and implemented with comprehensive database integration and quality assurance.
