# Phase 3 Strategy Shift: Horizontal Before Vertical

> **Note (2025-07-15)**: Strategy affirmed. Horizontal tasks now tracked as Phase C in ROADMAP_v2.1.

## The Strategic Pivot

After implementing T301 (Multi-Document Fusion), we're making a strategic shift from vertical depth (advanced reasoning) to horizontal breadth (comprehensive extraction).

## Why This Change?

### The Reality of Documents

Real-world documents aren't just text. Analysis of typical business/research documents shows:
- **Tables**: 30-50% of content (financial data, comparisons, results)
- **Figures/Charts**: 10-20% of content (trends, visualizations)
- **Text**: 30-60% of content
- **Mixed Layouts**: Headers, footers, sidebars, callouts

Currently, Super-Digimon only extracts the text portion, missing 40-70% of the information.

### The Reasoning Fallacy

Advanced reasoning on incomplete data is worse than basic reasoning on complete data:

```
Incomplete extraction + Advanced reasoning = Confident wrong answers
Complete extraction + Basic reasoning = Accurate useful answers
```

Example: A financial report where key metrics are in tables. Without table extraction, even the most sophisticated reasoning engine would miss the actual data and infer incorrectly from surrounding text.

## Revised Priority Order

### Phase 1: Horizontal Expansion (Current Focus)

1. **C1-T3H1: Table Extraction** ⭐ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
   - Extract tables from PDFs, Word docs, HTML
   - Preserve structure (headers, merged cells)
   - Convert to knowledge graph format

2. **C2-T3H2: PDF Enhancement**
   - Robust PDF parsing beyond basic text
   - Layout understanding
   - Image and caption extraction

3. **C3-T3H3: Integration Layer**
   - Connect T301 tools to main pipeline
   - Unified processing flow
   - Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 integration

4. **T3H4: Multi-Modal Extraction**
   - Extract and understand figures
   - Link captions to images
   - Basic chart data extraction

### Phase 2: Vertical Depth (Future)

5. **T302: Advanced Reasoning Engine**
6. **T303: Temporal Knowledge Tracking**
7. **T304: Cross-Domain Ontology Federation**
8. **T305: Advanced Query Understanding**
9. **T306: Research Evaluation Framework**

## Technical Approach for Table Extraction

### Libraries to Evaluate
- **tabula-py**: Java-based, good for simple PDFs
- **camelot**: Python-native, handles complex tables
- **pdfplumber**: Low-level control, good for custom logic
- **pandas.read_html**: For HTML tables
- **python-docx**: For Word document tables

### Table Extraction Pipeline
```python
@mcp.tool()
def extract_tables(document_path: str) -> List[TableData]:
    """Extract all tables from document."""
    
@mcp.tool()
def interpret_table_structure(table: TableData) -> TableStructure:
    """Understand headers, data types, relationships."""
    
@mcp.tool()
def table_to_graph(table: TableStructure, ontology: Ontology) -> GraphData:
    """Convert table to knowledge graph nodes and edges."""
```

### Success Criteria
- Extract 95%+ of tables accurately
- Handle complex structures (merged cells, nested tables)
- Preserve semantic meaning
- Convert to graph format intelligently

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate Value**: Users can extract complete documents today
2. **Foundation**: Complete data extraction enables better future reasoning
3. **Real-World**: Addresses actual user needs (processing reports, papers)
4. **Incremental**: Each horizontal capability adds standalone value
5. **Testing**: Easier to validate extraction accuracy than reasoning quality

## Migration Path

1. Complete T3H1-T3H4 (2-3 weeks)
2. Integration testing with real documents
3. Performance optimization
4. Then revisit T302-T306 with complete extraction foundation

## Conclusion

By prioritizing horizontal capabilities, we're building a system that handles real documents completely before making them "smart". This pragmatic approach delivers value faster and creates a solid foundation for future advanced features.
