## Dependencies

### Technical Prerequisites
- Phase 1 optimization complete
- Async API framework operational
- Unified configuration system deployed
- Health monitoring active

### Resource Requirements
- Backend developer (full-time)
- AI/ML specialist (75%)
- QA engineer (50%)
- Technical writer (25%)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **LLM API Costs**: Could exceed budget with 5 new LLM tools
   - Mitigation: Implement cost monitoring and caching

2. **Performance Degradation**: More tools could slow system
   - Mitigation: Lazy loading and performance testing

3. **Integration Complexity**: Cross-modal tools are complex
   - Mitigation: Start with simpler tools, build incrementally

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Temptation to add more features
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to defined tool list

2. **Quality vs Speed**: Pressure to rush implementation
   - Mitigation: Automated testing and code review requirements

## Performance Targets

### Tool Performance
- Individual tool execution: <5s average
- Batch processing: 10x improvement over sequential
- Memory usage: <2GB per tool instance
- Error rate: <5% across all tools

### System Performance
- End-to-end processing: <30s for 20-page paper
