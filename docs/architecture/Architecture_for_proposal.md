  1. Research Problem & Motivation

  Theory Automation Proof-of-Concept

  **System Vision**: KGAS is designed as a theory automation proof-of-concept for future LLM capabilities, not a general research tool for human researchers.

  **Primary Goal**: Build infrastructure for automated theory operationalization, validation, and application - proving that LLMs can systematically apply social science theories to empirical data without human intervention in theory selection or analytical method choice.

  **Core Innovation**: Automated theory processing - extracting theories from academic literature, converting them into executable analysis specifications, and applying them to datasets through LLM-driven workflows. The system is architected to prepare for increasingly powerful LLMs that can autonomously conduct theory-driven research.

  Key Capabilities Being Demonstrated

  **Cross-Modal Analysis Integration**: Enable LLMs to fluidly switch between analytical modes (graph, table, vector) as theoretical requirements demand, without human intervention in method selection.

  - Statistical models become networks: SEM results convert to graph structures for centrality and community analysis
  - Network topology informs statistics: Graph structure guides regression model specification and variable selection  
  - Cross-modal data transformation: Correlation matrices become edge weights for network analysis algorithms
  - Analytical mode complementarity: Vector clustering enhances statistics through embedding-based clustering
  - Uncertainty-aware integration: Cross-modal convergence reduces uncertainty through analytical triangulation

  **Automated Theory Operationalization**: 
  - Theory schemas to statistical models: Generate SEM specifications, regression models, and experimental designs directly from theoretical frameworks
  - Theory-driven agent creation: Convert theoretical propositions into agent behavioral rules for simulation testing
  - Executable theoretical predictions: Transform qualitative theories into quantitative, testable hypotheses with measurement specifications
  - Multi-theory comparison: Test competing theoretical explanations simultaneously through parallel analysis pipelines

  **Scale and Automation**:
  - Document processing: Analyze 1000+ documents compared to 100s possible with manual qualitative coding
  - Simultaneous multi-mode analysis: Run graph, statistical, and vector analyses concurrently on the same data
  - Automated workflow generation: Create complete analysis pipelines from natural language research questions through LLM tool orchestration
  - Large tool ecosystem: 121+ specialized tools available for LLM selection (tool count doesn't affect latency - LLM agents dynamically select appropriate tools based on descriptions and theoretical requirements)
