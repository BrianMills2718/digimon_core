# ADR-011: Academic Research Focus

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: System design must align with either academic research requirements or enterprise production requirements, as these have fundamentally different priorities and constraints.

## Decision

We will design KGAS as an **academic research tool** optimized for:

1. **Correctness over performance**: Prioritize accurate results and reproducibility
2. **Flexibility over optimization**: Support diverse research methods and theories  
3. **Transparency over efficiency**: Full provenance and explainable processing
4. **Local deployment over scalability**: Single-node research environment focus

```python
# Academic research design principles in code
class AcademicResearchTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.priority_order = [
            "correctness",      # Accurate results for publication
            "reproducibility",  # Complete audit trails
            "flexibility",      # Support diverse research approaches
            "transparency",     # Explainable processing steps
            "local_deployment", # Single researcher environment
            "performance"       # Optimize only after above requirements met
        ]
```

## Rationale

### **Why Academic Research Focus?**

**1. Research Requirements Are Unique**:
- **Methodological rigor**: Every processing step must be documented and justifiable
- **Reproducibility**: Complete workflows must be repeatable by other researchers
- **Domain flexibility**: Must support diverse social science theories and approaches
- **Citation integrity**: Every extracted fact must be traceable to original sources
- **Epistemic humility**: Must acknowledge and track uncertainty appropriately

**2. Academic vs. Enterprise Trade-offs**:

| Requirement | Academic Research | Enterprise Production |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Correctness** | Critical - wrong results invalidate months of work | Important - but can be iterated |
| **Performance** | Secondary - researchers work with smaller datasets | Critical - must handle high throughput |
| **Scalability** | Local - single researcher, 10-1000 documents | Enterprise - thousands of users, millions of documents |
| **Flexibility** | Critical - must support novel research approaches | Secondary - standardized business processes |
| **Security** | Appropriate - local research environment | Critical - enterprise security requirements |
| **Monitoring** | Academic - research validation focus | Enterprise - uptime and performance focus |

**3. Research Environment Constraints**:
- **Local deployment**: Researchers work on personal/institutional computers
- **Single-node processing**: No distributed infrastructure available
- **Limited technical expertise**: Researchers are domain experts, not DevOps engineers
- **Intermittent usage**: Used for specific research projects, not 24/7 operations

### **Why Not Enterprise Production Focus?**

**Enterprise production requirements would force compromises incompatible with research**:

**1. Performance over correctness**: Enterprise systems optimize for throughput, potentially sacrificing accuracy for speed
**2. Standardization over flexibility**: Enterprise systems standardize processes, limiting research methodology innovation
**3. Infrastructure complexity**: Enterprise scalability requires distributed systems expertise beyond typical research environments
**4. Security overhead**: Enterprise security adds complexity inappropriate for local research use

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Enterprise Production Tool**
**Rejected because**:
- **Performance focus**: Would prioritize speed over research accuracy requirements
- **Infrastructure requirements**: Would require database servers, distributed systems, DevOps expertise
- **Standardized workflows**: Would limit research methodology flexibility
- **Security complexity**: Would add inappropriate complexity for local research environments

### **2. Hybrid Academic/Enterprise Tool**
**Rejected because**:
- **Conflicting priorities**: Cannot optimize for both research correctness and enterprise performance
- **Feature complexity**: Would create confusing interfaces trying to serve both audiences
- **Maintenance overhead**: Would require maintaining two different optimization paths
- **Focus dilution**: Would compromise excellence in either domain

### **3. Enterprise Tool with Academic Add-ons**
**Rejected because**:
- **Core architecture mismatch**: Enterprise foundations incompatible with research transparency needs
- **Academic features as afterthought**: Research requirements become secondary considerations
- **Deployment complexity**: Enterprise infrastructure requirements inappropriate for research

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Research excellence**: Optimized for academic research requirements and workflows
- **Methodological integrity**: Supports rigorous research methodologies and citation practices
- **Local deployment**: Simple setup for individual researchers
- **Flexibility**: Can adapt to diverse research approaches and novel theories
- **Transparency**: Complete processing transparency for research validation

### **Negative**
- **Performance limitations**: Not optimized for high-throughput enterprise use cases
- **Scalability constraints**: Single-node design limits to researcher-scale datasets
- **Enterprise features**: Lacks enterprise monitoring, security, and infrastructure features
- **Market limitations**: Narrower user base than general-purpose enterprise tools

## Academic Research Design Implications

### **Development Priorities**
1. **Correctness validation**: Extensive testing to ensure accurate research results
2. **Provenance completeness**: Every operation fully documented for reproducibility
3. **Methodological flexibility**: Support for diverse research theories and approaches
4. **Citation integrity**: Complete source attribution for academic integrity
5. **Local deployment simplicity**: Easy setup on researcher personal/institutional computers

### **Non-Priorities (Explicitly Deprioritized)**
1. **Enterprise scalability**: High-throughput, multi-tenant architecture
2. **Production monitoring**: 24/7 uptime monitoring and alerting
3. **Enterprise security**: Complex authentication, authorization, audit systems
4. **Distributed processing**: Multi-node processing and coordination
5. **Performance optimization**: Micro-optimizations at expense of clarity

### **Feature Decisions Based on Academic Focus**

**Configuration**:
- Simple, file-based configuration over complex management systems
- Sensible defaults for academic use cases
- Clear documentation over automated configuration management

**Error Handling**:
- Fail-fast with clear error messages over graceful degradation
- Complete error context for debugging over user-friendly error hiding
- Research workflow recovery over automated error recovery

**Data Management**:
- Complete audit trails over storage optimization
- Local file-based storage over distributed database systems
- Research data retention policies over automated cleanup

**User Interface**:
- Research workflow optimization over general business process optimization
- Academic terminology and concepts over business terminology
- Research-specific visualizations over general-purpose dashboards

## Implementation Requirements

- **Citation management**: Automatic citation generation and source tracking
- **Export formats**: Academic publication formats (LaTeX, BibTeX, etc.)

### **Methodological Rigor**
