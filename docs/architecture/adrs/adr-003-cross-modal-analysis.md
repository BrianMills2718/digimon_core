# ADR-003: Cross-Modal Analysis Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Context**: Need for fluid analysis across graph, table, and vector representations

## Context

Academic social science research requires different analytical approaches depending on the research question. Graph analysis excels at relationship exploration, table analysis at statistical operations, and vector analysis at semantic similarity. However, existing systems force researchers to choose one representation and lose the benefits of others.

## Decision

We will implement a cross-modal analysis architecture with **synchronized views** rather than lossy conversions between representations.

### Core Components

1. **Unified Entity Identity**: Same entity ID across all representations (graph nodes, table rows, vector embeddings)
2. **Cross-Modal Converter**: Intelligent conversion between representations with full provenance tracking
3. **Semantic Preservation**: Non-lossy encoding that maintains complete meaning during transformations
4. **Mode Selection**: LLM-driven optimal representation selection based on research questions

### Architecture Pattern

```
Research Question → Optimal Mode Selection → Cross-Modal Processing → Source-Linked Results
```

## Rationale

### Synchronized Views Benefits
- **Complete Analytical Power**: Researchers can use the optimal tool for each sub-question
- **Information Preservation**: No loss of meaning during format conversions
- **Cumulative Insights**: Each analysis enriches the dataset for subsequent analyses
- **Source Traceability**: All results remain traceable to original documents

### Alternative Approaches Rejected
- **Single Mode Lock-in**: Forces suboptimal analysis for many research questions
- **Lossy Conversions**: Hash-based encoding loses semantic information
- **Disconnected Stores**: Same entities have different IDs across representations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Researchers can fluidly move between analytical modes
- Complete preservation of semantic meaning
- Unified provenance tracking across all representations
- Optimal tool selection for each research question

### Negative
- Increased system complexity compared to single-mode approaches
- Additional storage requirements for maintaining synchronized views
- More complex identity management across representations

### Neutral
- Requires sophisticated cross-modal conversion algorithms
- Performance considerations for maintaining synchronization

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- CrossModalEntity system with persistent IDs
- Intelligent conversion strategies between all representation pairs
- Provenance tracking through all transformations
- Quality metrics for conversion validation

### Quality Targets
- ≥80% semantic preservation in cross-modal transformations
- Complete identity consistency across representations
- Full bidirectional transformation capability
