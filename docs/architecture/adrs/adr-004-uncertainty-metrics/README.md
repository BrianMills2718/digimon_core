# ADR-004: Uncertainty Metrics Framework

**Status**: Research Phase  
**Decision Date**: TBD  
**Research Period**: July 2025  

---

## Overview

This directory contains all research, analysis, and planning related to implementing comprehensive uncertainty metrics in the KGAS (Knowledge Graph Analysis System).

## Directory Structure

### Research Documentation
All research findings, frameworks, and analysis are in [`adr-004-research/`](./adr-004-research/):

- **Primary Research**: `notes_on_handling_uncertainty_2025.07201658.md` - Core research insights
- **Framework Development**: Multiple framework synthesis and configuration documents
- **Academic Context**: CERQUAL methodology integration and academic requirements
- **Testing & Validation**: Stress tests, examples, and validation strategies
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed implementation approaches and best practices

### Decision Document
When research is complete, the final architectural decision will be documented in:
- `ADR-004-Uncertainty-Metrics-Framework.md` *(to be created)*

---

## Research Summary

**Core Challenge**: Implement uncertainty metrics that leverage frontier model LLMs for academic discourse analysis.

**Key Insight**: All KGAS operations produce "claims" requiring confidence assessment and uncertainty propagation through multi-step analytical workflows.

**Research Areas**:
- Confidence quantification strategies
- Uncertainty propagation mechanisms  
- Academic research integrity requirements
- CERQUAL methodology integration
- Discourse analysis specific applications

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete research synthesis
2. Finalize framework design
3. Create formal ADR-004 decision document
4. Begin implementation planning

---

This ADR will define how KGAS handles uncertainty and confidence assessment throughout the system, ensuring academic research integrity while leveraging advanced LLM capabilities.
