# Uncertainty Framework - Corrected for Discourse Analysis Context

## What KGAS Actually Is

**KGAS (Knowledge Graph Analysis System)**: Academic research tool for discourse analysis, specifically:
- **Dissertation Focus**: "Theoretical Foundations for LLM-Generated Ontologies and Analysis of Fringe Discourse"
- **Core Function**: Extract entities/relationships from text → Build knowledge graphs → Cross-modal analysis
- **Academic Purpose**: Analyze discourse patterns, especially fringe/alternative discourse communities
- **Research Context**: Single-node academic research tool, not general social science platform

## Relevant Uncertainty Challenges for Discourse Analysis

### 1. **Entity/Relationship Extraction Uncertainty**
**Real KGAS scenario**: Analyzing conspiracy theory documents

```python
# Text: "The deep state controls the media narrative about vaccines"
entity_extractions = {
    "deep state": {"ORGANIZATION": 0.4, "CONCEPT": 0.6},     # Ambiguous entity type
    "media": {"ORGANIZATION": 0.8, "CONCEPT": 0.2},          # More concrete
    "vaccines": {"PRODUCT": 0.9, "TOPIC": 0.1}              # Clear
}

relationship_extractions = {
    ("deep state", "controls", "media"): 0.7,              # High confidence pattern
    ("media", "controls", "narrative"): 0.6,               # Implicit relationship
    ("narrative", "about", "vaccines"): 0.9                # Clear connection
}
```

**Uncertainty Issue**: How confident should we be in extracting "deep state" as an entity vs. rhetorical device?

### 2. **Circular Causality in Discourse Networks** (REAL ISSUE)
**KGAS relevant scenario**: Discourse influence patterns

```python
# Research Question: How do fringe ideas spread through discourse communities?

# Circular causality in discourse:
Influential_Author_Post → Community_Adoption → Idea_Legitimacy → Author_Credibility → Influential_Author_Post

# DAG assumption broken in discourse analysis:
Author_Influence ← Idea_Adoption ← Community_Validation ← Author_Influence
```

**Real Problem**: Discourse influence involves feedback loops - authors become influential because communities adopt their ideas, but communities adopt ideas because authors are influential.

### 3. **Non-Stationary Learning for Discourse Evolution** (REAL ISSUE)
**KGAS relevant scenario**: Evolving conspiracy discourse

```python
# COVID vaccine discourse evolution
discourse_patterns_2020 = {
    P(Conspiracy_Reference | "vaccine") = 0.2,
    P(Government_Distrust | "mandate") = 0.4
}

# But discourse evolved
discourse_patterns_2023 = {
    P(Conspiracy_Reference | "vaccine") = 0.8,    # Discourse shifted
    P(Government_Distrust | "mandate") = 0.9      # Patterns changed
}
```

**Real Problem**: Fringe discourse evolves rapidly, making historical training data misleading for current analysis.

### 4. **Correlated Opinion Aggregation in Discourse Communities** (RELEVANT)
**KGAS scenario**: Analyzing discourse community sentiment

```python
# QAnon community discussing election fraud
community_opinions = {
    "core_believers": [-0.9, -0.8, -0.9, -0.7],    # Highly correlated negative
    "skeptics": [0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.0],              # Mildly correlated neutral
    "newcomers": [-0.5, -0.3, -0.6, -0.4]          # Influenced by core group
}

# Problem: Opinions within discourse communities are highly correlated
# Simple aggregation assumes independence but echo chambers create conformity
```

**Real Problem**: Discourse communities exhibit opinion clustering that violates independence assumptions.

### 5. **Temporal Validity in Evolving Discourse** (RELEVANT)
**KGAS scenario**: Tracking claim evolution

```python
# Discourse claim: "Vaccines cause autism"
temporal_facts = [
    ⟨"Vaccines", "cause", "Autism", [1998, 2010], [0.3, 0.5]⟩,    # Wakefield era
    ⟨"Vaccines", "cause", "Autism", [2010, 2020], [0.1, 0.3]⟩,    # Debunked period  
    ⟨"Vaccines", "cause", "Autism", [2020, None], [0.4, 0.7]⟩     # COVID resurgence
]

# Query: What was community confidence in this claim in 2019?
# Overlapping windows: Should we use [2010-2020] confidence or trend toward [2020-None]?
```

**Real Problem**: Discourse claims have cyclical validity - debunked claims can resurge with new evidence or events.

## KGAS-Specific Uncertainty Framework Needs

### 1. **Discourse Entity Resolution**
- **Challenge**: "Deep state" could be organization, concept, or rhetorical device
- **Solution**: Context-dependent entity typing with probability distributions
- **Confidence Factors**: Linguistic markers, discourse community norms, rhetorical context

### 2. **Claim Credibility vs. Community Acceptance**
- **Challenge**: Distinguish between claim truth and community belief in claim
- **Solution**: Separate confidence dimensions for factual accuracy vs. discourse adoption
```python
vaccine_autism_claim = {
    "scientific_credibility": [0.05, 0.15],      # Low scientific support
    "community_acceptance": [0.7, 0.9],          # High community belief
    "discourse_prevalence": [0.8, 0.95]          # Very common in discourse
}
```

### 3. **Rhetorical Uncertainty**
- **Challenge**: Sarcasm, irony, dog whistles in fringe discourse
- **Solution**: Rhetorical stance detection with uncertainty propagation
```python
text_analysis = {
    "literal_meaning": {"vaccines_harmful": 0.9},
    "rhetorical_stance": {"sincere": 0.3, "ironic": 0.7},
    "final_interpretation": {"vaccines_harmful": 0.3}  # Adjusted for irony
}
```

### 4. **Echo Chamber Aggregation**
- **Challenge**: Discourse communities have extremely correlated opinions
- **Solution**: Community-aware aggregation that accounts for echo chamber effects
```python
@dataclass
class DiscourseAggregation:
    individual_opinions: List[float]
    community_structure: Dict[str, List[int]]  # Which users in which subcommunities
    echo_chamber_coefficient: float           # How much within-group correlation
    
    def aggregate_discourse_aware(self):
        # Weight diverse opinions more heavily than echo chamber consensus
        pass
```

### 5. **Discourse Evolution Tracking**
- **Challenge**: Claims cycle through credibility in discourse communities
- **Solution**: Cyclical temporal models rather than monotonic decay
```python
@dataclass
class CyclicalClaim:
    base_credibility: float
    discourse_cycles: List[Tuple[datetime, float]]  # Credibility peaks/troughs
    current_trend: Literal["rising", "falling", "stable"]
    community_memory: float  # How long communities remember debunking
```

## Corrected Framework Priorities for KGAS

### Tier 1: Essential for Discourse Analysis
1. **Rhetorical stance uncertainty** - Critical for fringe discourse
2. **Community-aware aggregation** - Echo chambers violate independence  
3. **Cyclical temporal validity** - Claims resurge in discourse
4. **Entity type ambiguity** - "Deep state" as organization vs. concept

### Tier 2: Important for Academic Research
5. **Claim credibility vs. acceptance separation** - Truth vs. belief distinction
6. **Discourse network feedback loops** - Alternative to DAG models
7. **Evolution-aware learning** - Adapt to rapidly changing discourse patterns

### Not Relevant for KGAS
- Cross-cultural analysis (English focus confirmed)
- Financial modeling patterns
- Platform-specific observability 
- Adversarial robustness (academic context, not production)

## Uncertainty Explosion Reality Check

For KGAS discourse analysis:
```python
# Typical analysis chain
PDF → Text_Extraction → Entity_Recognition → Relationship_Extraction → 
Knowledge_Graph → Community_Detection → Discourse_Analysis → Pattern_Identification

# 8 steps with realistic confidences
chain_confidence = 0.95 * 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.85 * 0.75 * 0.6 * 0.7 = 0.15

# Final confidence: 15% - This is realistic for complex discourse analysis
# Academic value: "We can identify this pattern with 15% confidence" 
# Better than false precision of "Pattern detected with 87% confidence"
```

**Conclusion**: 15% confidence after 8-step analysis is honest uncertainty representation, not framework failure. Academic researchers should know when their analysis chains become uncertain.

This corrected analysis focuses on the actual KGAS use case: analyzing fringe discourse through knowledge graph construction and cross-modal analysis.
