# Current Best Practices for Uncertainty in KGAS - Synthesis

## Core Framework: CERQual-Based Universal Assessment

### Foundation Principle
All claims (factual, theoretical, interpretive) assessed using CERQual's four dimensions:
1. **Methodological Limitations**: Quality of extraction/analysis method
2. **Relevance**: Applicability to context 
3. **Coherence**: Internal consistency of evidence
4. **Adequacy of Data**: Sufficiency of supporting evidence

### Implementation
```python
@dataclass
class CERQualAssessment:
    methodological_limitations: float  # 0-1
    relevance: float                   # 0-1  
    coherence: float                   # 0-1
    adequacy_of_data: float           # 0-1
    
    def calculate_confidence(self) -> ConfidenceScore:
        # Start high, downgrade based on concerns
        concerns = [1.0 - self.methodological_limitations, 
                   1.0 - self.relevance,
                   1.0 - self.coherence, 
                   1.0 - self.adequacy_of_data]
        confidence = math.prod(concerns) ** (1/len(concerns))
        return ConfidenceScore(value=confidence, ...)
```

## Configurable Uncertainty Complexity

### Tier 1: Essential Configuration (Default Enabled)
1. **Distribution Preservation in Aggregation**
   - Maintain full distributions rather than averages
   - Detect and preserve polarization/bimodality
   - Track consensus vs disagreement metrics

2. **Context-Dependent Entity Resolution** 
   - Entity identity as probability distribution shaped by context
   - Dynamic disambiguation based on surrounding evidence
   - Context strength affects resolution confidence

3. **Missing Data Type Distinction**
   - "Measured absent" vs "Unmeasured" vs "Partially observed"
   - Bounds-based representation for unknowns
   - Missing data impact tracking

### Tier 2: Advanced Configuration (Configurable)
4. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Conditional probability propagation through analysis chains
   - Track direct dependencies between adjacent steps
   - Avoid independence assumptions where inappropriate

5. **Temporal Validity**
   - Time-bounded confidence with decay functions
   - Validity windows for time-sensitive claims
   - Assessment date relative to claim currency

### Configuration Framework
```python
@dataclass
class UncertaintyConfig:
    # Tier 1 - Essential
    preserve_distributions: bool = True
    context_entity_resolution: bool = True  
    distinguish_missing_types: bool = True
    
    # Tier 2 - Advanced
    dependency_tracking: Literal["independent", "conditional", "full_bayesian"] = "conditional"
    temporal_decay: Literal["none", "linear", "exponential", "step"] = "exponential"
    
    # Performance tuning
    max_distribution_groups: int = 10
    context_window_tokens: int = 500
```

## Fuzzy Categorization as Default

### Principle
Replace binary decisions with probability distributions:

```python
# Instead of: sentiment = "positive" 
# Use: sentiment = {"positive": 0.6, "negative": 0.3, "neutral": 0.1}

# Instead of: community = "climate_activist"
# Use: communities = {"climate": 0.4, "political": 0.8, "science": 0.3}
```

### Implementation in Tools
- All categorical outputs return distributions
- Maintain distributions through pipeline
- Provide "primary choice" + confidence for legacy compatibility

## LLM-Powered Configuration Intelligence

### Registry-Based Approach
```python
class UncertaintyRegistry:
    def register_technique(self, name: str, method: Callable, 
                          complexity: int, use_cases: List[str]):
        # Register aggregation/propagation techniques with metadata
        
    def llm_recommend_config(self, analysis_request: AnalysisRequest) -> UncertaintyConfig:
        # LLM assesses:
        # - Analysis type and research goals
        # - Data characteristics (size, sparsity, domains)
        # - Accuracy vs performance requirements
        # Returns optimized configuration
```

### LLM Assessment Capabilities
- Evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost
- Assess when polarization preservation matters vs simple averaging
- Determine appropriate temporal decay models
- Configure context sensitivity based on domain mixing

## Unified Confidence Representation

### Enhanced ConfidenceScore
```python
@dataclass
class AdvancedConfidenceScore(ConfidenceScore):
    # Core CERQual-based confidence
    value: float  # 0-1
    evidence_weight: float
    
    # Distribution preservation
    is_aggregate: bool = False
    subgroup_distribution: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
    polarization_index: Optional[float] = None
    
    # Temporal aspects
    assessment_time: datetime
    validity_window: Optional[Tuple[datetime, Optional[datetime]]] = None
    temporal_decay_function: Optional[Callable] = None
    
    # Missing data handling
    measurement_type: Literal["measured", "imputed", "bounded", "unknown"] = "measured"
    data_coverage: float = 1.0  # What fraction of needed data was available
    
    # Context and dependencies
    depends_on: Optional[List[str]] = None  # IDs of dependent claims
    context_strength: Optional[float] = None
```

## Best Practices Summary

### 1. Universal CERQual Assessment
- All claims assessed using same four-dimensional framework
- No special handling for "factual" vs "theoretical" uncertainty
- Start with high confidence, downgrade based on specific concerns

### 2. Configurable Complexity
- Default to Tier 1 features (distribution preservation, context resolution, missing data distinction)
- Enable Tier 2 features (dependencies, temporal) based on analysis needs
- LLM configures optimal settings per analysis

### 3. Fuzzy-First Design
- Probability distributions as primary representation
- Binary decisions only when forced by external interfaces
- Preserve uncertainty richness throughout pipeline

### 4. Evidence-Based Validation
- Mechanical Turk comparison for uncertainty assessments
- Accept that LLMs may outperform average humans
- Focus on consistency and reasoning quality

### 5. Registry-Based Extensibility
- Multiple aggregation/propagation techniques available
- LLM selects appropriate technique based on context
- Easy addition of new uncertainty handling methods

# Stress Test Examples - Revealing Remaining Issues

## Example 1: Cross-Language Meme Analysis
**Scenario**: Analyzing humor and cultural references across languages

### The Challenge
```
Dataset: Memes shared across Twitter in English, Spanish, Mandarin
Task: Identify "universal" vs "culture-specific" humor patterns
```

### Analysis Steps
1. **Humor Detection per Language**
   - English memes: LLM confidence varies by cultural context
   - Spanish memes: May reference cultural figures unknown to training data
   - Mandarin memes: Character-based humor, visual puns, different humor patterns

2. **Cross-Cultural Mapping**
   - "Karen" (English) ≈ "Mère Louve" (French) ≈ ? (Mandarin)
   - Different cultural references for same underlying concept
   - Confidence should reflect cultural knowledge limitations

3. **Universal Pattern Identification**
   - Claim: "Sarcasm patterns are universal across languages"
   - How do we assess confidence when LLM training is English-heavy?

### Problem Revealed: Cultural Knowledge Asymmetry

```python
# Current approach might give false confidence
humor_analysis = {
    "english_humor_confidence": 0.85,  # High - well-represented in training
    "spanish_humor_confidence": 0.85,  # Same - but should be lower?
    "mandarin_humor_confidence": 0.85  # Same - definitely should be lower
}

# Reality: LLM confidence should vary by cultural knowledge
humor_analysis_realistic = {
    "english_humor": {"confidence": 0.85, "cultural_coverage": 0.95},
    "spanish_humor": {"confidence": 0.65, "cultural_coverage": 0.70}, 
    "mandarin_humor": {"confidence": 0.45, "cultural_coverage": 0.30}
}
```

**Issue**: Our CERQual framework doesn't account for training data asymmetries and cultural knowledge gaps.

## Example 2: Longitudinal Community Evolution
**Scenario**: Tracking how online communities change ideologically over time

### The Challenge
```
Timeline: 2019-2024 analysis of "GamersGate" community
Question: How did community sentiment toward women in gaming evolve?
```

### Temporal Complexity
1. **Community Membership Changes**
   - 2019: 10,000 active users
   - 2021: 15,000 users (50% overlap with 2019)
   - 2024: 12,000 users (30% overlap with 2019)

2. **Definition Drift**
   - "Gamer" meant different things in 2019 vs 2024
   - Platform changes affect who counts as "community member"
   - Sentiment measurement techniques improved over time

3. **Confounding Events**
   - Major gaming scandals in 2020, 2022
   - Platform policy changes
   - Broader cultural shifts

### Problem Revealed: Longitudinal Identity and Causation

```python
# Current approach treats each time point independently
longitudinal_analysis = [
    {"year": 2019, "sentiment": -0.6, "confidence": 0.8},
    {"year": 2021, "sentiment": -0.2, "confidence": 0.8}, 
    {"year": 2024, "sentiment": 0.1, "confidence": 0.8}
]

# Conclusion: "Community became more positive toward women in gaming"
# But this ignores:
# - Community membership completely changed
# - Definition of "gamer" evolved
# - External events influenced sentiment
# - Measurement methods improved
```

**Issue**: No framework for assessing confidence in longitudinal identity continuity and causal attribution.

## Example 3: Multi-Platform Influence Networks
**Scenario**: Tracking information flow across Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Discord

### The Challenge
```
Research Question: How do conspiracy theories spread across platforms?
Data: Posts mentioning "bird flu lab leak" theory across 4 platforms
```

### Cross-Platform Complexity
1. **Platform-Specific Features**
   - Twitter: Text + links, public conversations
   - TikTok: Video content, algorithmic feeds
   - Reddit: Threaded discussions, community moderation
   - Discord: Private servers, real-time chat

2. **Cross-Platform Entity Resolution**
   - Same person on multiple platforms? (usernames don't match)
   - Same idea expressed differently? (video vs text vs meme)
   - Influence direction? (Twitter → TikTok or TikTok → Twitter?)

3. **Influence Measurement Challenges**
   - Different engagement metrics (likes, views, comments, shares)
   - Platform algorithms affect visibility
   - Private platforms (Discord) vs public

### Problem Revealed: Cross-Modal Confidence Equivalence

```python
# Current approach might treat platforms equally
influence_analysis = {
    "twitter_spread": {"reach": 10000, "confidence": 0.8},
    "tiktok_spread": {"reach": 50000, "confidence": 0.8},  # Same confidence?
    "reddit_spread": {"reach": 5000, "confidence": 0.8},
    "discord_spread": {"reach": "unknown", "confidence": 0.2}
}

# But measurement confidence should vary dramatically
platform_measurement_reality = {
    "twitter": {"observability": 0.95, "measurement_accuracy": 0.9},
    "tiktok": {"observability": 0.60, "measurement_accuracy": 0.7},  # Algorithm hidden
    "reddit": {"observability": 0.85, "measurement_accuracy": 0.8},
    "discord": {"observability": 0.10, "measurement_accuracy": 0.3}  # Mostly private
}
```

**Issue**: Platform-specific observability and measurement limitations not reflected in confidence.

## Example 4: Synthetic Content Detection Uncertainty
**Scenario**: Analyzing user-generated content in an era of AI-generated text/images

### The Challenge
```
Dataset: Social media posts about climate policy (2023-2024)
Unknown: What percentage is AI-generated? How does this affect analysis?
```

### Authenticity Uncertainty Cascade
1. **Content Authenticity Assessment**
   - Text: Could be human or ChatGPT/Claude generated
   - Images: Could be real photos or DALL-E/Midjourney
   - User profiles: Could be real people or AI-managed accounts

2. **Analysis Validity Questions**
   - If 30% of content is AI-generated, how does this affect sentiment analysis?
   - Do AI-generated posts express "real" opinions or algorithmic artifacts?
   - Should synthetic content be excluded or weighted differently?

3. **Detection Confidence**
   - AI detection tools have false positive/negative rates
   - Sophisticated AI can fool detection
   - Human-AI collaboration makes detection harder

### Problem Revealed: Epistemic Uncertainty About Reality

```python
# Current analysis assumes content authenticity
climate_sentiment = {
    "overall_sentiment": 0.45,
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "n_posts": 10000
}

# But with synthetic content uncertainty
climate_sentiment_with_authenticity = {
    "overall_sentiment": 0.45,
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "authenticity_uncertainty": {
        "estimated_ai_generated": 0.3,  # 30% estimated synthetic
        "detection_confidence": 0.65,   # Low confidence in detection
        "impact_if_synthetic": "unknown"  # Don't know how this affects results
    },
    "epistemic_warning": "Results validity depends on unknown authenticity distribution"
}
```

**Issue**: No framework for "uncertainty about the reality of the data itself."

## Example 5: Recursive Theory Application
**Scenario**: Using theory-derived insights to refine theory application

### The Challenge
```
Initial: Apply "Social Capital Theory" to analyze Twitter networks
Finding: Discover that retweets don't map well to "bridging capital"
Adaptation: Modify operationalization based on findings
Question: What's the confidence in the modified theory application?
```

### Recursive Uncertainty
1. **Initial Theory Application**
   - Social Capital Theory → Twitter operationalization
   - Retweets = bridging capital (confidence: 0.6)
   - Results seem inconsistent with theory

2. **Theory Refinement**
   - Modify: Quote tweets = bridging, simple retweets = endorsement
   - New operationalization (confidence: ??)
   - But this is now "data-driven theory modification"

3. **Meta-Uncertainty**
   - How confident are we in the modified theory?
   - Is this legitimate theory refinement or overfitting?
   - How do we assess confidence in recursive theory application?

### Problem Revealed: Bootstrap Confidence Problem

```python
# Circular reasoning in confidence assessment
initial_theory_confidence = 0.6
data_analysis_results = analyze_with_theory(theory, data)
# Results don't match expectations

modified_theory = refine_theory(theory, data_analysis_results)
modified_theory_confidence = ???  # How do we assess this?

# If we use the same data to both modify and validate theory,
# confidence assessment becomes circular
```

**Issue**: No framework for assessing confidence in data-driven theory modifications without circular reasoning.

## Synthesis: Deep Remaining Issues

### 1. **Cultural/Training Asymmetry**
LLM confidence doesn't reflect knowledge limitations across cultures/domains.

### 2. **Longitudinal Identity Continuity** 
No framework for "is this the same community/phenomenon over time?"

### 3. **Cross-Modal Observability Differences**
Platform-specific measurement limitations not reflected in confidence.

### 4. **Epistemic Reality Uncertainty**
Uncertainty about whether data represents reality (synthetic content, deception).

### 5. **Recursive Bootstrap Problem**
Confidence assessment in theory-data feedback loops.

These issues suggest we need:
- **Domain-aware confidence calibration**
- **Longitudinal identity tracking**
- **Platform-specific measurement confidence**
- **Meta-epistemic uncertainty representation**
- **Bootstrap-aware theory refinement confidence**
