# ADR-017: Structured Output Migration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Context**: LLM integrations throughout the system required manual JSON parsing with high error rates and inconsistent validation  
**Decision**: Migrate all LLM operations to schema-first structured output using Pydantic validation  
**Rationale**: Eliminates JSON parsing errors, ensures type safety, enables comprehensive monitoring  
**Consequences**: All LLM operations now use validated schemas; improved reliability and observability  
**Alternatives**: Manual JSON parsing with error handling; third-party validation libraries  

## Background

The KGAS system relied heavily on LLM-generated JSON responses across multiple components:
- Entity extraction operations
- Reasoning and decision-making processes  
- Tool orchestration and selection
- Cross-modal analysis operations

Prior to this migration, these operations used manual JSON parsing with `json.loads()` and custom validation logic, leading to:
- **High error rates**: ~20% failure rate due to malformed JSON
- **Inconsistent validation**: Different components used different validation approaches
- **Poor observability**: Limited visibility into LLM operation performance
- **Maintenance burden**: Complex error handling and retry logic throughout codebase

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive structured output system with the following components:

### 1. StructuredLLMService (`src/core/structured_llm_service.py`)
- Central service for all LLM operations requiring structured output
- LiteLLM integration with `response_format={"type": "json_object"}`
- Pydantic schema validation with automatic error handling
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection

### 2. Pydantic Schema Library (`src/orchestration/reasoning_schema.py`)
- Comprehensive schema definitions for all LLM operations
- Type-safe data structures with validation constraints
- Self-documenting schemas with field descriptions
- Reusable components across system boundaries

### 3. Monitoring Framework (`src/monitoring/structured_output_monitor.py`)
- Real-time performance tracking for all structured output operations
- Health validation with configurable alert thresholds
- Component-specific analytics and error categorization
- Export capabilities for analysis and debugging

### 4. Integration Pattern
All components requiring LLM operations follow this pattern:
```python
from src.core.structured_llm_service import get_structured_llm_service
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ComponentResponse(BaseModel):
    # Schema definition with validation

def component_operation(input_data):
    llm_service = get_structured_llm_service()
    return llm_service.structured_completion(
        prompt=build_prompt(input_data),
        schema=ComponentResponse,
        temperature=0.05
    )
```

    field: str = Field(description="Field description")
    
# 2. Use StructuredLLMService
def new_component_operation():
    llm_service = get_structured_llm_service()
    return llm_service.structured_completion(
        prompt="...",
        schema=NewComponentResponse
    )
```
