# ADR-005: Strategic Buy vs Build Decisions for External Services

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Context**: Strategic decision framework for external service integration vs internal development

## Context

KGAS has reached production maturity with exceptional technical capabilities (0.910 theory extraction score, 121+ MCP tools, complete cross-modal analysis). The strategic question arises: which capabilities should remain proprietary competitive advantages ("BUILD") versus which infrastructure can be accelerated through external integrations ("BUY")?

## Decision

We will implement a **strategic "Buy vs Build" framework** that preserves core competitive advantages while accelerating development through selective external integrations.

### Core Decision Framework

**BUILD (Preserve Competitive Advantages)**:
- Unique academic research capabilities
- Novel computational approaches  
- Core intellectual property

**BUY (Accelerate Infrastructure)**:
- Commodity infrastructure services
- Standard document processing
- Established academic APIs
- Operational tooling

## Rationale

### Strategic Analysis Results
- **Development Acceleration**: 27-36 weeks time savings potential
- **Cost-Benefit**: 163-520% ROI in first year
- **Risk Management**: Preserve unique capabilities while leveraging proven solutions

### Core Competitive Advantages (DEFINITIVE "BUILD")

#### 1. Theory Extraction System
- **Current Status**: 0.910 production score (world-class)
- **Justification**: No commercial equivalent exists
- **Architecture Decision**: Continue internal development and enhancement
- **Competitive Moat**: Unique capability in computational social science

#### 2. Cross-Modal Analysis Framework
- **Current Status**: Novel Graph/Table/Vector intelligence with 100% semantic preservation
- **Justification**: First-of-its-kind synchronized multi-modal views
- **Architecture Decision**: Core proprietary technology
- **Competitive Moat**: Patentable cross-modal orchestration patterns

#### 3. Theory Composition Engine
- **Architectural Pattern**:
```python
class MultiTheoryCompositionEngine:
    """Enable complex multi-perspective research analysis"""
    
    async def compose_theories_sequential(self, theories: List[str], document: str):
        """Apply theories in sequence with result chaining"""
        
    async def compose_theories_parallel(self, theories: List[str], document: str):
        """Apply theories in parallel with result synthesis"""
        
    async def map_cross_theory_concepts(self, theory1: str, theory2: str):
        """Create semantic bridges between theoretical frameworks"""
```

#### 4. DOLCE Ontology Integration
- **Architecture Decision**: Maintain specialized academic ontology integration
- **Justification**: Deep domain expertise required for research validity

### Infrastructure Acceleration (DEFINITIVE "BUY")

#### 1. Document Processing Services
**Architectural Integration Pattern**:
```python
class ExternalDocumentProcessor:
    """Orchestrate external document processing with KGAS core"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.external_processors = {
            'markitdown': 'microsoft/markitdown',  # Format conversion
            'content_extractor': 'lfnovo/content-core',  # Content extraction
            'academic_parser': 'specialized academic formats'
        }
    
    async def process_document(self, document_path: str) -> ProcessedDocument:
        """Route document through appropriate external processor"""
        # Maintain KGAS provenance and quality standards
        # Apply theory-aware post-processing
```

#### 2. Academic API Integration
**Services to Integrate**:
- **ArXiv MCP Server**: Automated paper discovery
- **PubMed Integration**: Medical/life sciences corpus  
- **Semantic Scholar API**: Citation networks
- **Crossref Integration**: DOI resolution & metadata

**Architectural Constraint**: All external data must flow through KGAS theory-aware processing

#### 3. Infrastructure Services
**Operational Services**:
- Authentication: Auth0 or Keycloak integration
- Monitoring: DataDog or Prometheus stack
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions + Docker
- Cloud Deployment: Multi-cloud managed services

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Development Acceleration**: 50-67% faster feature delivery
- **Cost Efficiency**: $78,000-104,000 development savings in first year
- **Competitive Advantage**: Preserved unique academic research capabilities
- **Market Access**: 50M+ academic papers through integrated APIs

### Negative  
- **External Dependencies**: Increased dependency management complexity
- **Integration Overhead**: Additional testing and validation requirements
- **Vendor Risk**: Potential service disruptions or pricing changes

### Neutral
- **Architecture Complexity**: Balanced by development acceleration gains
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Offset by reduced internal infrastructure development

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Architecture Requirements

#### MCP Integration Orchestrator
```python
class KGASMCPOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrate external MCP services with KGAS core"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.external_mcps = {
            'academic': ['arxiv-mcp', 'pubmed-mcp', 'biomcp'],
            'document': ['markitdown-mcp', 'content-core-mcp'],
            'knowledge': ['neo4j-mcp', 'chroma-mcp', 'memory-mcp'],
            'analytics': ['dbt-mcp', 'vizro-mcp', 'optuna-mcp']
        }
        self.core_mcps = ['theory-extraction', 'cross-modal', 'provenance']
    
    async def orchestrate_analysis(self, request: AnalysisRequest):
        """Coordinate external and core MCP services"""
        # Route to appropriate MCP services
        # Maintain provenance across external calls  
        # Apply KGAS theory-aware intelligence
```

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
External Data Sources → External Processing → KGAS Theory Engine → Results
      ↓                        ↓                    ↓              ↓
   ArXiv/PubMed         MarkItDown/Parsers   Theory Extraction   Research
   Semantic Scholar     Content Extractors   Cross-Modal        Output
   Academic APIs        Format Converters    MCL Integration    Visualization
