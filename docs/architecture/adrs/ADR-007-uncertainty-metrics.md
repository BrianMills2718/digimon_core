# ADR-007: CERQual-Based Uncertainty Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-20  
**Context**: Need for principled uncertainty quantification in academic social science research

## Context

Academic social science research requires rigorous uncertainty quantification to ensure research validity and reproducibility. LLM-based analysis tools introduce multiple sources of uncertainty (epistemic, aleatoric, model-based) that must be quantified and propagated through analytical pipelines. Standard software engineering confidence scores are insufficient for academic rigor.

## Decision

We will implement a **CERQual-based uncertainty quantification framework** with four-layer architecture and configurable complexity.

### Framework Choice: CERQual
- **CERQual**: Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research
- **Academic Standard**: Established methodology for social science uncertainty assessment
- **Domain Fit**: Specifically designed for discourse analysis and qualitative research

### Four-Layer Architecture

1. **Contextual Entity Resolution**: Dynamic disambiguation with uncertainty
2. **Temporal Knowledge Graph**: Time-bounded confidence decay
3. **Bayesian Pipeline**: Dependency modeling and uncertainty propagation
4. **Distribution Preservation**: Full uncertainty distribution maintenance

### Configurable Complexity
- **Simple**: Basic confidence scores for immediate usability
- **Standard**: CERQual assessment with moderate detail
- **Advanced**: Full Bayesian uncertainty propagation
- **Research**: Complete distributional analysis for publication

## Rationale

### CERQual Framework Benefits
- **Academic Recognition**: Established methodology accepted in social science journals
- **Domain Appropriate**: Designed specifically for qualitative discourse analysis
- **Quality Assessment**: Provides structured approach to evidence quality evaluation
- **Research Validity**: Enhances reproducibility and research rigor

### Four-Layer Approach Benefits
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses all major uncertainty sources
- **Propagation Tracking**: Maintains uncertainty through complex analytical chains
- **Configurable Detail**: Researchers can choose appropriate complexity level
- **Academic Standards**: Meets requirements for academic publication

### Alternative Approaches Rejected
- **Simple Confidence Scores**: Insufficient for academic rigor
- **Engineering Reliability Metrics**: Not aligned with social science methodology
- **Single-Layer Uncertainty**: Fails to capture uncertainty propagation complexity

## Consequences

### Positive
- Academic research meets publication standards for uncertainty reporting
- Configurable complexity allows adaptation to research needs
- Comprehensive uncertainty propagation through analytical pipelines
- Integration with established academic methodologies

### Negative
- Increased computational complexity for advanced uncertainty modes
- Additional metadata storage requirements
- Learning curve for researchers unfamiliar with uncertainty quantification

### Neutral
- Requires calibration for different domains and LLM models
- Performance trade-offs between uncertainty detail and processing speed

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- CERQual framework integration with all analytical components
- Four-layer uncertainty propagation architecture
- Configurable complexity levels (simple to advanced)
- Uncertainty-aware tool contracts for all operations

### Quality Targets
- â‰¥99% statistical robustness through integration pipelines
- Proper calibration for social science discourse analysis
- Uncertainty propagation without significant degradation
- Academic standards compliance for research publication
