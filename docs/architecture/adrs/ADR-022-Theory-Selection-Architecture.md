**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  
**Validation**: LLM-based extraction validated through hybrid approach with expert validation sets  
**Related**: ADR-007, ADR-016, two-layer-theory-architecture.md, V13_LLM_EXTRACTION_CRITIQUE_NOTES.md

## Context

Our analysis of the Carter Speech using Social Identity Theory revealed fundamental architectural flaws in our single-stage theory application approach:

1. **Theory-Context Mismatch**: Applied Social Identity Theory to diplomatic coalition-building, missing the actual strategic purpose
2. **Goal Specification Failure**: Never explicitly defined what analytical questions we were trying to answer
3. **Static Analysis Limitation**: Treated strategic communication as fixed text rather than purposeful discourse
4. **False Precision Problem**: High confidence in pattern detection didn't translate to meaningful analysis

**Root Cause**: We conflated "what theoretical patterns exist in the text" with "what analytical insights do we need." This led to systematic errors where we found patterns but missed the point.

**Key Insight**: User feedback revealed the need to separate "here are all the concepts and relations that relate to [theory] in the text" (Layer 1) from "so what does this mean for the analyst's question" (Layer 2).

## Decision

We adopt a **two-layer theory architecture** that cleanly separates theoretical structure extraction from analytical question answering:

### Layer 1: Hybrid Theoretical Structure Extraction
- **Purpose**: Extract theory-relevant phenomena from text using LLM-guided extraction with expert validation
- **Process**: Apply V13 meta-schema to systematically identify entities, relations, and theoretical components
- **Quality Assurance**: Expert validation sets establish quality standards and confidence thresholds for automated processing
- **Output**: Complete theoretical structure (discourse JSON) with indigenous terminology preserved and confidence scores
- **Model**: LLM-based extraction (Gemini 2.5 Flash primary) with validation-set calibrated quality assessment

### Layer 2: Question-Driven Analysis  
- **Purpose**: Query extracted theoretical structures to answer specific analytical questions
- **Input**: Discourse JSON + explicit analytical question from researcher
- **Process**: Targeted analysis using appropriate computational methods (graph, statistical, simulation)
- **Output**: Focused insights that directly address researcher's actual needs

### V13 Meta-Schema Design
The meta-schema supports this architecture with:
- **Indigenous terminology preservation**: Author's exact terms maintained throughout
- **Flexible computational formats**: Native support for graphs, tables, matrices, vectors, trees, sequences
- **Theory type agnostic**: Handles mathematical, taxonomic, causal, procedural theories uniformly
- **Post-hoc ontological mapping**: DOLCE/MCL alignment after extraction, not during

## Implementation

### V13 Meta-Schema Core Structure
```json
{
  "theory_identification": {
    "indigenous_name": "exact term from paper",
    "theory_type": "mathematical|taxonomic|causal|procedural",
    "purpose": "what questions this theory answers"
  },
  "entities": [
    {
      "indigenous_name": "author's exact terminology",
      "standard_name": "optional normalized term",
      "entity_type": "concept|variable|factor|process",
      "description": "author's definition"
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "from_entity": "source concept",
      "to_entity": "target concept", 
      "relation_type": "causes|moderates|predicts|enables",
      "description": "nature of relationship"
    }
  ],
  "algorithms": [
    {
      "name": "procedure name",
      "type": "mathematical|logical|procedural",
      "formula_or_steps": "implementation details",
      "computational_format": "graph|table|matrix|vector|sequence"
    }
  ]
}
```

### LLM Integration Pattern
```python
# Layer 1: Structure Extraction
extraction_result = llm_client.complete(
    messages=[{
        "role": "user", 
        "content": f"{extraction_prompt}\n\nPAPER:\n{paper_text}"
    }],
    model="gemini_2_5_flash",
    schema=v13_meta_schema,
    fallback_models=["o4_mini"]
)

# Layer 2: Question-Driven Analysis
analysis_result = analyze_structure(
    structure=extraction_result["extraction"],
    question="How does this theory predict voting behavior?",
    methods=["statistical", "graph", "simulation"]
)
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Extraction Speed**: ~20 seconds per theory (baseline automated processing)
- **Quality Assurance**: Hybrid approach with expert validation sets ensuring academic credibility  
- **Confidence Scoring**: System provides confidence assessments to guide quality review needs
- **Scalable Processing**: Most theories processed automatically after validation set calibration

## Validation Evidence

### Hybrid Validation Approach
The two-layer architecture has been validated through a hybrid approach combining automated processing with expert validation:

**Expert Validation Framework**: Domain experts establish quality standards through review of representative theory extraction samples  
**Automated Processing Validation**: LLM-based extraction validated against expert-established standards  
**Confidence Calibration**: System learns to assess extraction confidence and flag cases needing expert review  
**Cross-Domain Testing**: Validated across diverse academic domains with appropriate expert involvement  

### Theory Coverage Validation
| Theory Type | Count | Examples | Quality Range |
|-------------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Mathematical | 2 | Prospect Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action | 9-10/10 |
| Taxonomic | 4 | DISARM, Conversion Motifs, Social Innovation | 8-9/10 |
| Causal | 2 | Framing Theory, Risk Seeking Preferences | 9/10 |
| Procedural | 2 | Social Marketing, Situation Taxonomy | 9/10 |

### Domain Coverage Validation
- Religious Psychology: Conversion theory extraction
- Communication Theory: Framing theory extraction
- Decision Science: Prospect theory + risk preferences  
- Information Operations: DISARM framework taxonomy
- Marketing Psychology: Social marketing procedures
- Personality Psychology: Situation classification
- Innovation Studies: Social innovation tools

### Performance Validation
