# Theory Implementation Evolution

**Status**: Reference Document  
**Purpose**: Links to exploratory theory implementation approaches

## Current Status

Theory implementation approaches are being explored with various claims about automated code generation and complex entity resolution. These explorations need validation against current scope and architectural decisions.

## Related Exploratory Documents

### Implementation Claims
The following documents in `/Thinking_out_loud/Implementation_Claims/` make specific implementation claims:

- **[THEORY_TO_CODE_WORKFLOW.md](../Thinking_out_loud/Implementation_Claims/THEORY_TO_CODE_WORKFLOW.md)** - Claims complete workflow from theory extraction to executable code with 6 component categories
- **[social_identity_theory_example_with_entity_resolution.md](../Thinking_out_loud/Implementation_Claims/social_identity_theory_example_with_entity_resolution.md)** - Complex entity resolution example with Bayesian updating
- **[CONCRETE_QUANTITATIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md](../Thinking_out_loud/Implementation_Claims/CONCRETE_QUANTITATIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md)** - Specific quantitative implementation examples

### Claims to Validate

1. **Theory-to-Code Generation**:
   - Mathematical formulas → Python functions (Validated)
   - Algorithms → Computational methods (❓ Needs validation)
   - Procedures → Step workflows (❓ Needs validation) 
   - Rules → OWL2 DL reasoning (❓ Scope question)
   - Sequences → State machines (❓ Needs validation)
   - Frameworks → Classification systems (❓ Needs validation)

2. **Entity Resolution Complexity**:
   - Bayesian updating for ambiguous references
   - Retroactive entity resolution
   - Constraint propagation across references
   - **Scope Question**: Is this level of complexity appropriate for single-user academic research?

3. **Integration Scope**:
   - V12/V13 schema integration claims
   - Cross-modal theory integration
   - Automated component detection from theory schemas

## Integration with Stable Architecture

### Current Stable Documents
- **[theory-extraction-integration.md](theory-extraction-integration.md)** - Current theory processing architecture
- **[theory-repository-abstraction.md](theory-repository-abstraction.md)** - Theory storage and management

### Validation Against Scope

**From [LIMITATIONS.md](../LIMITATIONS.md)**:
- "Single-node, single-leader application"
- "Academic research project"  
- "Local, single-user research workflows"

**Questions**:
- Does complex entity resolution align with academic research scope?
- Is automated code generation from theories a priority for single-user workflows?
- Should focus be on simpler, more reliable theory application patterns?

## Architectural Alignment

### Related ADRs
- **[ADR-022-Theory-Selection-Architecture.md](../adrs/ADR-022-Theory-Selection-Architecture.md)** - Two-layer theory architecture
- **[ADR-020-Agent-Based-Modeling-Integration.md](../adrs/ADR-020-Agent-Based-Modeling-Integration.md)** - ABM integration approach

### Implementation Priority Questions

1. **Mathematical Formula Implementation** (Working):
   - Continue development and expand test coverage
   - Focus on reliability and accuracy

2. **Complex Entity Resolution** (❓ Scope question):
   - Validate necessity for academic research use cases
   - Consider simpler entity tracking approaches
   - Evaluate implementation effort vs. research value

3. **Automated Code Generation** (❓ Ambitious claims):
   - Validate technical feasibility beyond formulas
   - Consider incremental implementation approach
   - Focus on highest-value categories first

## Decision Points

### Immediate Decisions Needed

1. **Entity Resolution Scope**: Simple entity tracking vs. complex Bayesian resolution
2. **Code Generation Priority**: Which theory component types to implement first
3. **Schema Integration**: V13 stabilization and integration approach

### Implementation Strategy Options

**Option A: Incremental Validation**
- Validate each implementation claim through prototyping
- Start with simplest approaches, add complexity as proven valuable
- Focus on single-user academic workflow optimization

**Option B: Ambitious Implementation** 
- Implement full theory-to-code claims
- Build complex entity resolution system
- Risk: May exceed scope and resources

**Option C: Scope Reduction**
- Focus on mathematical formula implementation (working)
- Simple theory-guided entity extraction (no complex resolution)
- Defer advanced automation to future phases

## Recommendation

**Validate implementation claims against**:
1. **User needs**: What do academic researchers actually need?
2. **Technical feasibility**: What can be reliably implemented?
3. **Resource constraints**: What can be maintained long-term?
4. **Architectural alignment**: What fits with stable architecture decisions?

**Timeline**: Validation should occur before committing to specific implementation approaches in Phase 2.
