# Thinking Out Loud - Exploratory Architecture Documents

**Purpose**: This directory contains exploratory documents that represent thinking-out-loud processes, philosophical investigations, and implementation claims that are not yet part of the stable architecture.

**Status**: Exploratory - Not part of target architecture
**Date Organized**: 2025-01-29

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `Analysis_Philosophy/`
**Purpose**: Fundamental questions about what type of analysis KGAS should perform

**Documents**:
- `ANALYTIC_TIER_BOUNDARY_CONFUSION.md` - Explores confusion between text analysis vs. world analysis
- `ANALYTIC_TIER_MULTIPLE_MEANINGS.md` - Text-internal vs. text-external analysis dimensions  
- `SYSTEMATIC_TEXT_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md` - First principles approach to text analysis
- `DIMENSIONS_OF_ANALYSIS_CONFUSION.md` - Additional analysis dimension exploration

**Key Questions Explored**:
- What is the primary analytical goal of KGAS?
- Should we analyze text properties or use text to analyze the world?
- How do different theories map to different analysis types?

**Relevance to Stable Architecture**: These philosophical questions need resolution before finalizing the analytical framework in `/concepts/` and `/specifications/`.

### `Implementation_Claims/`
**Purpose**: Documents making specific implementation claims that may exceed current scope or architectural decisions

**Documents**:
- `THEORY_TO_CODE_WORKFLOW.md` - Claims complete workflow from theory extraction to executable code
- `social_identity_theory_example_with_entity_resolution.md` - Complex entity resolution example
- `CONCRETE_QUANTITATIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md` - Specific implementation examples
- `ENHANCED_TOOLS_INTEGRATION.md` - Tool integration enhancement claims

**Status**: These documents make implementation claims that need validation against:
- Current scope (single-user academic research)
- Technical feasibility 
- Resource constraints
- Stable architecture decisions

**Relevance to Stable Architecture**: Implementation claims should be validated and integrated into `/systems/` component designs or moved to roadmap planning.

### `Architectural_Exploration/`
**Purpose**: Experimental architectural approaches and alternatives

**Documents**:
- `SIX_LEVEL_THEORY_AUTOMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Multi-level automation approach
- `Cross-Modal Analysis Orchestration plan.md` - Cross-modal orchestration exploration
- `CARTER_PROBLEMS_MAPPED_TO_FRAMEWORK.md` - Framework application exploration
- `TWO_STAGE_APPROACH_CRITIQUE.md` - Critique of architectural approaches

**Status**: Alternative architectural explorations that may or may not align with current direction

**Relevance to Stable Architecture**: Useful ideas should be extracted and integrated into ADRs or component designs in `/systems/`.

### `Schema_Evolution/`
**Purpose**: Schema version exploration and evolution thinking
**Status**: Currently empty - ready for schema evolution documents when needed

## üîÑ Integration with Stable Architecture

### Documents That Need Integration
Several documents contain valuable insights that should be integrated into stable architecture:

1. **Analysis Philosophy** ‚Üí Needs resolution in `/concepts/theoretical-framework.md`
2. **Implementation Claims** ‚Üí Should be validated and integrated into `/systems/` component designs
3. **Architectural Exploration** ‚Üí Good ideas should become ADRs or component specifications

### Reference Links to Stable Architecture

#### Analysis Philosophy References
- **Target Integration**: `/concepts/theoretical-framework.md` - Should resolve analytical purpose questions
- **Related Stable Docs**: `/concepts/cross-modal-philosophy.md` - Cross-modal analysis approach
- **Related ADRs**: `/adrs/ADR-022-Theory-Selection-Architecture.md` - Theory integration decisions

#### Implementation Claims References  
- **Target Integration**: `/systems/theory-extraction-integration.md` - Theory processing architecture
- **Related Stable Docs**: `/systems/statistical-analysis-architecture.md` - Statistical capabilities
- **Related ADRs**: `/adrs/ADR-020-Agent-Based-Modeling-Integration.md` - ABM integration decisions

#### Architectural Exploration References
- **Target Integration**: Various `/systems/` component documents
- **Related Stable Docs**: `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level system design
- **Related ADRs**: Multiple ADRs for specific architectural decisions

## üéØ Next Steps

### For Analysis Philosophy Documents
1. **Review**: Determine which analytical philosophy to adopt
2. **Decide**: Text-internal vs. text-external analysis approach
3. **Integrate**: Final decisions into `/concepts/theoretical-framework.md`
4. **Archive**: Non-selected approaches for historical reference

### For Implementation Claims Documents
1. **Validate**: Claims against current scope and resources
2. **Extract**: Feasible implementation patterns
3. **Integrate**: Validated patterns into `/systems/` component designs
4. **Plan**: Ambitious claims into roadmap documentation

### For Architectural Exploration Documents
1. **Evaluate**: Alternative approaches against current architecture
2. **Extract**: Valuable insights and patterns
3. **Document**: Selected approaches as ADRs
4. **Archive**: Non-selected approaches with rationale

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Guidelines

- **Do NOT reference** these documents from stable architecture
- **Do NOT implement** based solely on these explorations
- **Do extract** valuable insights for stable architecture integration
- **Do use** as reference for understanding design evolution

These documents represent the thinking process, not architectural decisions. All architectural decisions should be documented in the stable architecture directories (`/adrs/`, `/concepts/`, `/systems/`, `/specifications/`).
