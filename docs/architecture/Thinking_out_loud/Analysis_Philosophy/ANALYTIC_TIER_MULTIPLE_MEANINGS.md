# Multiple Meanings of Analytic Tiers: Text-Internal vs. Text-External Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Purpose**: Explore the different meanings each analytic tier can have depending on whether we're analyzing the text itself or using text to analyze the external world

## üéØ **The Fundamental Distinction**

Following your insight about discourse methodologies, we can distinguish:

1. **Text-Internal Analysis**: What can we say ABOUT the text itself?
2. **Text-External Analysis**: What can we say about the WORLD using the text as evidence?

Each analytic tier has different meanings depending on which we're doing.

## üìä **Descriptive Tier: Multiple Meanings**

### **Text-Internal Descriptive**
*What patterns exist IN the text?*

**Example**: Carter's 1978 Speech
- "Text contains 47 references to allies and partnerships"  
- "Text uses active voice in 73% of sentences about US actions"
- "Text employs military metaphors in 23% of paragraphs"
- "Speech structure follows classical rhetoric pattern (ethos-pathos-logos)"

### **Text-External Descriptive** 
*What patterns exist in the WORLD that the text reveals?*

**Example**: Carter's 1978 Speech  
- "US alliance network includes 15 formal treaty partners as described"
- "Soviet military capabilities are characterized as growing threat"
- "International system exhibits bipolar structure with proxy competition"
- "Defense spending priorities reflect force modernization strategy"

### **The Difference**
- Text-internal: Properties of the linguistic artifact
- Text-external: Properties of reality the text describes

## üîç **Explanatory Tier: Multiple Meanings**

### **Text-Internal Explanatory**
*Why does the text say what it says? What explains its linguistic choices?*

**Example**: Social Security Message
- "Text uses possession language ('your Social Security') because ownership framing increases perceived legitimacy"
- "Text employs threat language ('take away') because loss frames create stronger emotional responses"  
- "Text avoids policy details because complexity reduces message effectiveness"

### **Text-External Explanatory**
*What causal mechanisms in the world does the text reveal or discuss?*

**Example**: Social Security Message
- "Social Security faces funding shortfall because demographics shifted since 1935"
- "Political opposition exists because benefit cuts impose concentrated costs"
- "Reform difficulty stems from program's third-rail political status"

### **The Difference**
- Text-internal: Why the author made certain communicative choices
- Text-external: Why the world works the way the text describes

## üéØ **Predictive Tier: Multiple Meanings**

### **Text-Internal Predictive**
*What effects will this text have on audiences?*

**Example**: Policy Speech
- "Loss-framed messages will generate 2.3x stronger emotional responses than gain-framed"
- "This rhetoric will increase public support for defense spending by 8-12%"
- "Frame resonance will be higher among conservative audiences (0.73 vs 0.45)"

### **Text-External Predictive**  
*What will happen in the world based on what the text tells us?*

**Example**: Policy Speech
- "Alliance commitments described suggest NATO expansion likely"
- "Military modernization priorities indicate focus on great power competition"
- "Budget requests imply defense spending increase of 15-20%"

### **The Difference**
- Text-internal: Effects of the communication itself
- Text-external: Outcomes in reality based on what the text reveals

## üí° **Prescriptive Tier: Multiple Meanings**

### **Text-Internal Prescriptive**
*How should we craft better text for desired communicative effects?*

**Example**: Health Campaign
- "Use gain frames for prevention behaviors, loss frames for cessation behaviors"
- "Include specific numbers to make abstract risks concrete"
- "Position desired behavior as social norm (87% of peers do X)"

### **Text-External Prescriptive**
*What should we do in the world based on what the text tells us?*

**Example**: Health Campaign
- "Increase vaccination funding based on efficacy data presented"
- "Expand public health infrastructure given vulnerability analysis"  
- "Revise guidelines based on new research findings discussed"

### **The Difference**
- Text-internal: How to communicate more effectively
- Text-external: What actions to take in reality

## üîß **Implications for Prospect Theory**

### **Text-Internal Prospect Theory Applications**

**Descriptive**: "Text exhibits loss framing in 73% of policy discussions"
**Explanatory**: "Text uses certainty language because certainty effect increases persuasion"
**Predictive**: "This message will generate risk-averse responses due to gain domain framing"
**Prescriptive**: "Reframe as loss prevention to increase behavioral compliance"

### **Text-External Prospect Theory Applications**

**Descriptive**: "Decision-makers exhibit loss aversion in policy choices described"
**Explanatory**: "Policy resistance occurs because changes threaten status quo reference points"
**Predictive**: "Stakeholders will likely resist reform due to endowment effect for current benefits"
**Prescriptive**: "Design policy rollout to minimize loss perception and reference point disruption"

## üé® **Cross-Cutting Analysis Dimensions**

### **The 2x4 Matrix**

|                    | Text-Internal | Text-External |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Descriptive**    | Linguistic patterns | World patterns |
| **Explanatory**    | Communication choices | Causal mechanisms |
| **Predictive**     | Text effects | World outcomes |
| **Prescriptive**   | Better messaging | Better action |

### **Theory Application Varies by Quadrant**

**Prospect Theory in Text-Internal Analysis**:
- Focus on framing effects, reference points in language
- Predict audience psychological responses
- Design choice architecture in communication

**Prospect Theory in Text-External Analysis**:
- Identify decision-making patterns in described events
- Explain policy choices through psychological mechanisms
- Predict stakeholder behaviors in real situations

## üèÜ **The Deeper Insight**

Each theory can operate in BOTH dimensions simultaneously:

**Example**: Analyzing a climate policy speech
- **Text-Internal**: "Speech uses loss frames to increase urgency (communication effect)"
- **Text-External**: "Policymakers exhibit present bias in climate decisions (world phenomenon)"

The same theoretical framework (Prospect Theory) applies differently depending on whether we're analyzing the text as communication or the text as evidence about reality.

## üéØ **Questions This Raises**

1. **Should theories specify** which dimension(s) they primarily address?
2. **Do some theories work better** for text-internal vs. text-external analysis?
3. **How do we handle cases** where both dimensions are relevant simultaneously?
4. **Should the meta-schema** explicitly distinguish these dimensions?

Your insight reveals that our analytic tiers are actually **cross-cut by this fundamental distinction** - we're not just choosing a tier, we're choosing a tier AND a dimension of analysis.
