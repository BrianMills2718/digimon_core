# The Analytic Tier Boundary Problem: What Are We Actually Analyzing?

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Purpose**: Clarify the confusion between analyzing text vs. analyzing the world vs. analyzing effects

## üéØ **The Core Confusion**

When we apply Prospect Theory to text, what exactly are we trying to do? The boundaries between descriptive, explanatory, predictive, and prescriptive blur because we're conflating different levels of analysis:

1. **Text-level analysis**: What does the text say?
2. **World-level analysis**: What does the text tell us about external reality?
3. **Effect-level analysis**: How will this text affect people?
4. **Design-level analysis**: How should we craft text for desired effects?

## üîç **Example: "Don't let them take away your Social Security"**

### **The Boundary Confusion**

**My Previous "Explanatory" Analysis**:
> "**Why it works**: Loss aversion - people fear losing existing benefits more than they value potential gains"

**Problems with this**:
- Is this explaining the TEXT? (No - text doesn't mention loss aversion)
- Is this explaining the WORLD? (No - it's not about Social Security policy)  
- Is this explaining EFFECTS? (Yes - why this message might persuade)
- Is this explaining DESIGN? (Yes - why someone chose this frame)

**This is actually a PREDICTIVE claim** about likely effects, not an explanatory claim about the text content.

## üìä **Clearer Distinctions**

### **Descriptive: What's Actually in the Text**

**Pure Text Description**:
- "Text uses imperative mood ('Don't let them')"
- "Text frames Social Security as possession ('your Social Security')"
- "Text implies external threat ('them take away')"
- "Text uses ownership language ('what you've earned')"

**NOT Description**:
- "Text uses loss aversion" (loss aversion isn't mentioned in text)
- "Text will be persuasive" (that's a prediction about effects)

### **Explanatory: Why the Text Says What It Says**

**Explaining Text Content**:
- "Text uses possession language because Social Security is legally an entitlement"
- "Text frames as 'taking away' because benefits could be reduced by legislation"
- "Text says 'what you've earned' because contributions create psychological ownership"

**NOT Explanation**:
- "Text works because of loss aversion" (that's predicting effects)
- "Text is effective" (that's evaluating outcomes, not explaining content)

### **Predictive: What Effects the Text Will Likely Have**

**Predicting Behavioral Effects**:
- "This framing will likely increase opposition to benefit cuts"
- "Loss frame should be more effective than equivalent gain frame"
- "Older audiences will respond more strongly than younger audiences"

**Predicting Based on Theory**:
- "Prospect Theory predicts this loss frame will be ~2.25x more impactful than gain frame"

### **Prescriptive: How to Design Better Text**

**Design Recommendations**:
- "To increase support for Social Security, use ownership language"
- "Frame benefit cuts as losses, not as 'reform'"
- "Add specific dollar amounts to make losses concrete"

## üé® **Applying This to Prospect Theory**

### **What Prospect Theory Actually Does at Each Level**

**Descriptive Applications**:
- Identify reference points mentioned or implied in text
- Catalog gain/loss language actually used
- Note certainty vs. probability expressions present

**Explanatory Applications** (This is the tricky one):
- Explain why text uses certain frames given the context
- Explain why text sets particular reference points
- Explain text choices based on author's goals and constraints

**Predictive Applications**:
- Predict audience responses to different frames
- Forecast behavioral outcomes from message exposure
- Anticipate choice patterns based on text content

**Prescriptive Applications**:
- Recommend optimal framing strategies
- Design choice architecture in text
- Craft nudges for desired outcomes

## üîß **The Real Boundary Issues**

### **1. Explanation vs. Prediction Boundary**

**Blurry Example**: "This text uses loss framing because loss aversion makes it more effective"

**Is this**:
- Explaining why the text says what it says? (Yes)
- Predicting the text will be effective? (Also yes)

**Resolution**: These can be both - explanation of design choices often predicts effects.

### **2. Description vs. Explanation Boundary**

**Blurry Example**: "Text frames Social Security as earned benefit"

**Is this**:
- Describing what's in the text? (Yes - if text says "earned")
- Explaining the framing choice? (Also yes - if we add "because...")

**Resolution**: Description becomes explanation when we add causal reasoning.

### **3. Prediction vs. Prescription Boundary**

**Blurry Example**: "Loss framing will increase opposition to cuts"

**Is this**:
- Predicting what will happen? (Yes)
- Prescribing what should happen? (Depends on goals)

**Resolution**: Same prediction can serve different prescriptive goals.

## üí° **A Cleaner Framework**

### **Three Core Questions**

1. **Content Analysis**: What does the text actually say?
2. **Effect Analysis**: What will this text do to people?
3. **Design Analysis**: How should we craft text for desired effects?

### **How Prospect Theory Helps**

**For Content Analysis**:
- Systematic framework for identifying decision-relevant elements
- Vocabulary for describing framing, reference points, probabilities

**For Effect Analysis**:
- Theoretical basis for predicting audience responses
- Mechanisms explaining why certain content affects behavior

**For Design Analysis**:
- Principles for crafting more effective messages
- Guidelines for choice architecture and nudging

## üéØ **The Deeper Problem**

The tier system assumes we're doing ONE thing, but text analysis often requires doing ALL THREE:

1. Understand what the text says (content)
2. Predict what it will do (effects)  
3. Evaluate how well it achieves goals (design)

Maybe the real question isn't "Which tier?" but "Which combination of analyses does this situation require?"

## üèÜ **Bottom Line**

You're absolutely right that the boundaries are blurry because we're mixing:
- **Text analysis** (what's there)
- **Effect analysis** (what happens)
- **Design analysis** (what should be)

Prospect Theory can contribute to all three, but we need to be clear about which level we're operating on at any given moment.
