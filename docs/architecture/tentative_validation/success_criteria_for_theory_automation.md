Success Criteria for Theory Automation

  Measurable Success Metrics

  Level 1: Basic Theory Processing
  - LLM can extract theory schemas from 80%+ of academic papers in standardized V13 format 
  - Theory validation system correctly identifies theory-data mismatches with 85%+ accuracy
  - System can automatically map 70%+ of theory constructs to DOLCE ontology categories    

  Level 2: Automated Theory Selection
  - Given a research question, LLM selects appropriate theories with 75%+ expert agreement 
  - System can automatically identify when multiple theories are applicable vs. conflicting
  - LLM can explain theory selection reasoning in academically acceptable format

  Level 3: Automated Operationalization
  - LLM converts theory schemas into executable analysis pipelines without human intervention
  - Generated analysis workflows produce results comparable to expert-designed studies
  - System can automatically switch analytical modes (graph→table→vector) based on theoretical requirements

  Level 4: End-to-End Automation (The ultimate proof)
  - LLM takes research question + dataset → automatically selects theory → generates analysis → produces academically valid conclusions
  - Results pass basic academic quality thresholds (logical coherence, appropriate method selection, reasonable conclusions)
  - System can handle novel theory combinations not seen in training data

  Validation Approach

  - Gold Standard: Compare LLM theory automation against expert social scientists on same research questions
  - Benchmark Dataset: 100 research questions across 5 domains with expert-validated "correct" theory applications
  - Quality Metrics: Academic reviewers blind-rate LLM vs. human theory applications

  Cross-Modal Conversion Performance Expectations

  Academic Dataset Scale Estimates

  Small Academic Dataset (100-1,000 entities):
  - Graph→Table: 5-15 seconds (node property extraction + metrics calculation)
  - Table→Vector: 10-30 seconds (text embedding generation)
  - Vector→Graph: 20-45 seconds (similarity calculation + edge creation)

  Medium Academic Dataset (1,000-10,000 entities):
  - Graph→Table: 30-90 seconds (network metrics computation is expensive)
  - Table→Vector: 2-5 minutes (embedding generation scales linearly)
  - Vector→Graph: 5-15 minutes (similarity matrix computation is O(n²))

  Large Academic Dataset (10,000+ entities):
  - Graph→Table: 5-20 minutes (PageRank, betweenness centrality calculations)
  - Table→Vector: 10-30 minutes (batch embedding generation)
  - Vector→Graph: 30-120 minutes (may require sampling or approximation)

  Performance Scaling Strategy

  - Sampling: For datasets >10,000 entities, use representative sampling
  - Approximation: Use approximate algorithms for large-scale network metrics
  - Caching: Cache expensive computations (embeddings, centrality scores)
  - Progressive: Start with subset, expand if needed

  Hardware Assumptions

  - Development: Single workstation with GPU for embedding generation
  - Future: More powerful hardware will improve these estimates significantly
  - Academic Focus: Prioritize correctness over speed - 30 minutes is acceptable for novel theory automation

  Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs

  - High Quality Mode: Full computation, no approximations (use these estimates)
  - Fast Mode: Sampling + approximations (10x faster, slightly reduced accuracy)
  - Interactive Mode: Progressive results (show partial results while computing)

  These estimates assume you're building for proof-of-concept validation, not production speed. The goal is demonstrating that theory automation works, not competing with existing tools on performance.
