# Uncertainty Architecture for KGAS

**Status**: Target Architecture  
**Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Purpose**: Define the comprehensive uncertainty handling architecture for Knowledge Graph Analysis System

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

### Core Philosophy: Everything is a Claim with Uncertainty

KGAS treats all analytical outputs as claims with associated uncertainty rather than definitive facts. This applies universally to:
- **Factual claims**: "Tim Cook is CEO of Apple"
- **Theoretical claims**: "This community exhibits high bridging social capital"  
- **Interpretive claims**: "This tweet expresses sarcasm"
- **Synthetic content claims**: "This text is AI-generated"

### Universal Assessment Framework: CERQual

All uncertainty assessment uses the four CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) dimensions:

1. **Methodological Limitations**: Quality and appropriateness of the extraction/analysis method
2. **Relevance**: Applicability of evidence to the specific research context
3. **Coherence**: Internal consistency and logical coherence of the evidence
4. **Adequacy of Data**: Sufficiency and richness of supporting evidence

This unified framework eliminates artificial distinctions between "factual" and "theoretical" uncertainty.

## 2. Hybrid Uncertainty Architecture

### Four-Layer Architecture

The uncertainty system employs a hybrid architecture with four specialized layers, each optimized for specific uncertainty challenges:

#### Layer 1: Contextual Entity Resolution
- **Technology**: Transformer-based contextual embeddings (BERT-style)
- **Function**: Dynamic entity identity resolution where context creates identity
- **Output**: Probability distributions over candidate entities
- **Handles**: "Apple company vs apple fruit" disambiguation, context-dependent confidence

#### Layer 2: Temporal Knowledge Graph with Imprecise Probability
- **Technology**: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) with interval-based confidence representation
- **Function**: Store facts with temporal validity and formal ignorance representation
- **Format**: `⟨subject, predicate, object, [start_time, end_time], [confidence_lower, confidence_upper]⟩`
- **Handles**: Time-bounded facts, missing vs measured absence distinction

#### Layer 3: Bayesian Network Pipeline Scaffolding
- **Technology**: Bayesian Network with learned Conditional Probability Tables
- **Function**: Model dependencies between pipeline stages for uncertainty propagation
- **Structure**: Nodes = pipeline stages, Edges = dependencies
- **Handles**: Dependent uncertainty cascades, conditional probability propagation

#### Layer 4: Distribution-Preserving Aggregation
- **Technology**: Mixture Models + Bayesian Hierarchical Models
- **Function**: Preserve distributional information during aggregation
- **Output**: Model parameters instead of single summary statistics
- **Handles**: Polarization preservation, subgroup structure maintenance

### Advanced Features

#### Meta-Learning for Proactive Competence Assessment
- **Purpose**: Proactively estimate model competence in new domains before analysis
- **Technology**: Transferable Meta-Learning (TML) for domain-specific competence prediction
- **Output**: Expected accuracy and recommended uncertainty adjustments

#### Meta-Epistemic Uncertainty for Synthetic Content
- **Purpose**: Handle "uncertainty about data authenticity"
- **Technology**: Bayesian authenticity modeling with detection confidence
- **Handles**: AI-generated content, bot detection, authenticity uncertainty propagation

#### Adaptive Computation Architecture
- **Purpose**: Dynamic resource allocation based on query importance and uncertainty level
- **Levels**: Fast (softmax scores) → Medium (MC Dropout) → Deep (full ensemble)
- **Triggers**: Low confidence, high importance, novel patterns

## 3. Uncertainty Configuration Framework

### Configurable Complexity Tiers

#### Tier 1: Essential Features (Always Enabled)
1. **Context-dependent entity resolution** - Dynamic disambiguation based on context
2. **Temporal validity tracking** - Time-bounded confidence with decay functions
3. **Missing data type distinction** - "Measured absent" vs "Unmeasured" vs "Partially observed"
4. **Distribution preservation in aggregation** - Maintain full distributions, detect polarization

#### Tier 2: Advanced Features (Configurable)
5. **Dependency tracking via Bayesian Networks** - Model pipeline stage dependencies
6. **Temporal confidence decay** - Time-based confidence degradation
7. **Cross-modal observability adjustments** - Platform-specific measurement confidence
8. **Meta-learning competence assessment** - Domain-specific confidence calibration

#### Tier 3: Specialized Features (Critical Cases Only)
9. **Recursive cognitive refinement** - Iterative self-correction for complex analyses
10. **Collective reasoning consensus** - Multiple model agreement for ambiguous cases
11. **Bootstrap-aware theory refinement** - Confidence in data-driven theory modifications

### Configuration Intelligence

LLM assesses analysis requirements and configures optimal uncertainty handling:

```python
@dataclass
class UncertaintyConfig:
    # Tier 1 - Essential
    preserve_distributions: bool = True
    context_entity_resolution: bool = True  
    distinguish_missing_types: bool = True
    temporal_validity: bool = True
    
    # Tier 2 - Advanced
    dependency_tracking: Literal["independent", "conditional", "full_bayesian"] = "conditional"
    temporal_decay: Literal["none", "linear", "exponential", "step"] = "exponential"
    meta_competence_assessment: bool = True
    authenticity_uncertainty: bool = True
    
    # Tier 3 - Specialized
    recursive_refinement: bool = False
    collective_reasoning: bool = False
    
    # Performance tuning
    max_distribution_groups: int = 10
    context_window_tokens: int = 500
    computation_level: Literal["fast", "medium", "deep"] = "medium"
```

---

## 4. Uncertainty Representation

### Enhanced Confidence Score

```python
@dataclass
class AdvancedConfidenceScore:
    # Core CERQual assessment
    value: float  # Combined confidence from 4 CERQual dimensions
    evidence_weight: float
    methodological_quality: float
    relevance_to_context: float
    coherence_score: float
    data_adequacy: float
    
    # Temporal aspects
    assessment_time: datetime
    validity_window: Optional[Tuple[datetime, Optional[datetime]]] = None
    temporal_decay_function: Optional[Callable] = None
    
    # Distribution information (for aggregates)
    is_aggregate: bool = False
    subgroup_distribution: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
    polarization_index: Optional[float] = None
    distribution_type: Optional[str] = None  # "unimodal", "bimodal", "uniform"
    
    # Missing data handling
    measurement_type: Literal["measured", "imputed", "bounded", "unknown"] = "measured"
    data_coverage: float = 1.0  # Fraction of needed data available
    missing_data_impact: Optional[float] = None
    
    # Dependencies and context
    depends_on: Optional[List[str]] = None  # IDs of dependent claims
    context_strength: Optional[float] = None
    
    # Meta-epistemic uncertainty
    authenticity_confidence: Optional[float] = None
    synthetic_content_probability: Optional[float] = None
    
    # Meta-learning assessment
    domain_competence_estimate: Optional[float] = None
    competence_assessment_confidence: Optional[float] = None
```

### Fuzzy Categorization as Default

All categorical outputs return probability distributions instead of binary decisions:

```python
# Traditional approach (information loss)
sentiment = "positive"
community = "climate_activist"

# KGAS approach (uncertainty preservation)
sentiment = {
    "positive": 0.6,
    "negative": 0.3,
    "neutral": 0.1
}

communities = {
    "climate_activist": 0.4,
    "political_general": 0.8,
    "science_enthusiast": 0.3,
    "technology": 0.2
}
```

## 5. Uncertainty Propagation Rules

### Dependency-Aware Propagation

1. **Independent stages**: Use conservative interval multiplication
2. **Dependent stages**: Apply Bayesian Network conditional probability tables
3. **Unknown dependencies**: Use Probability Bounds Analysis (most conservative approach)
4. **Mixed dependencies**: Combine approaches based on dependency strength

### Temporal Propagation

1. **Current relevance**: Apply decay function from assessment_time to query_time
2. **Validity windows**: Hard boundaries for fact applicability
3. **Evidence freshness**: Weight newer evidence more heavily in aggregation
4. **Change point detection**: Identify when confidence profiles shift significantly

### Aggregation Propagation

1. **Distribution preservation**: Fit mixture models, propagate distributional parameters
2. **Subgroup tracking**: Maintain minority opinions and polarization patterns
3. **Consensus metrics**: Separate confidence in aggregation method from confidence in components
4. **Polarization detection**: Identify and preserve bimodal or multimodal distributions

---

## 6. Cross-Modal Analysis Integration

### Format-Specific Uncertainty Handling

#### Graph Analysis Mode
- **Node confidence**: Entity resolution and attribute certainty
- **Edge confidence**: Relationship extraction and temporal validity
- **Structural confidence**: Community detection and centrality measures
- **Propagation**: Graph-specific uncertainty flow through network topology

#### Table Analysis Mode
- **Cell confidence**: Individual value certainty and imputation quality
- **Column confidence**: Feature validity and measurement consistency
- **Row confidence**: Record completeness and quality
- **Statistical confidence**: Analysis validity given uncertainty distribution

#### Vector Analysis Mode
- **Embedding confidence**: Representation quality and semantic validity
- **Similarity confidence**: Distance measure reliability and context appropriateness
- **Cluster confidence**: Grouping stability and interpretability
- **Search confidence**: Query relevance and retrieval quality

### Cross-Modal Uncertainty Translation

When converting between analysis modes, uncertainty characteristics must be translated appropriately:

```python
class CrossModalUncertaintyTranslator:
    def graph_to_table_uncertainty(self, graph_confidence: AdvancedConfidenceScore) -> AdvancedConfidenceScore:
        """Translate graph-based uncertainty to table format"""
        # Node uncertainty → Row confidence
        # Edge uncertainty → Cell confidence
        # Network structure → Statistical validity
        
    def table_to_vector_uncertainty(self, table_confidence: AdvancedConfidenceScore) -> AdvancedConfidenceScore:
        """Translate table-based uncertainty to vector space"""
        # Statistical uncertainty → Embedding confidence
        # Missing values → Vector component uncertainty
        # Correlation structure → Similarity reliability
```

        computation_level = self.computation_scheduler.select_level(claim, context)
        
        # Perform core CERQual assessment
        base_confidence = self.cerqual_assessor.assess(claim, context)
        
        # Apply advanced features based on configuration
        if self.config.meta_competence_assessment:
            domain_adjustment = self.meta_learner.assess_competence(context.domain)
            base_confidence = self.adjust_for_competence(base_confidence, domain_adjustment)
        
        # Handle temporal aspects
        if self.config.temporal_validity:
            temporal_confidence = self.temporal_manager.apply_decay(base_confidence, context.time)
            base_confidence = self.combine_temporal(base_confidence, temporal_confidence)
        
        # Process aggregation if needed
        if context.is_aggregate and self.config.preserve_distributions:
            return self.distribution_preserver.aggregate_with_uncertainty(
                base_confidence, context.component_confidences
            )
        
        return base_confidence
```

## 8. Research Validation Strategy

### Multi-Level Validation Approach

#### Level 1: Mechanical Validation
- **Human Expert Comparison**: Compare LLM uncertainty assessments to domain expert judgments
- **Calibration Testing**: Verify that 80% confidence equals 80% accuracy across domains
- **Consistency Analysis**: Ensure uncertainty reasoning quality and reproducibility

#### Level 2: Utility Validation  
- **Downstream Task Performance**: Evaluate uncertainty quality by downstream decision quality
- **Information Preservation**: Verify aggregation preserves critical distributional patterns
- **Error Impact Assessment**: Measure how uncertainty guides appropriate action under ambiguity

#### Level 3: Meta-Evaluation
- **Collective Reasoning**: Use consensus among diverse models as ground truth for complex cases
- **Process Validation**: Focus on reasoning process quality when AI potentially exceeds human performance
- **Edge Case Robustness**: Test graceful degradation under extreme uncertainty

### Calibration Across Domains

Recognition that LLM uncertainty should reflect domain-specific competence limitations:

```python
class DomainCalibration:
    calibration_curves = {
        "english_text_analysis": {"slope": 1.0, "intercept": 0.0},  # Well calibrated
        "multilingual_analysis": {"slope": 0.8, "intercept": 0.1},  # Overconfident
        "theoretical_constructs": {"slope": 1.2, "intercept": -0.1}, # Underconfident
        "synthetic_content": {"slope": 0.6, "intercept": 0.2}      # Significantly overconfident
    }
```

## 9. Integration with KGAS Architecture

### Tool Contract Integration

All tools must implement uncertainty-aware contracts:

```python
@dataclass
class UncertaintyAwareToolResult:
    status: Literal["success", "error", "uncertain"]
    data: Any
    confidence: AdvancedConfidenceScore
    uncertainty_factors: Dict[str, float]
    reasoning: str
    recommendations: Optional[List[str]] = None
```

### Cross-Modal Service Integration

Uncertainty architecture integrates with core KGAS services:

- **IdentityService**: Context-dependent entity resolution with uncertainty
- **ProvenanceService**: Track uncertainty propagation through analysis chains
- **QualityService**: CERQual-based quality assessment for all outputs
- **AnalyticsService**: Cross-modal uncertainty translation and preservation
- **TheoryRepository**: Theory-specific uncertainty patterns and calibration

### Pipeline Orchestrator Integration

The PipelineOrchestrator incorporates uncertainty at each stage:

1. **Pre-analysis**: Competence assessment and resource allocation
2. **During analysis**: Real-time uncertainty tracking and propagation
3. **Post-analysis**: Uncertainty aggregation and quality validation
4. **Error handling**: Uncertainty-guided fallback strategies

## 11. Architectural Patterns

### Uncertainty-First Design Pattern

All components designed with uncertainty as a first-class citizen:

```python
# Anti-pattern: Uncertainty as afterthought
result = analyze_sentiment(text)
confidence = estimate_confidence(result)

# KGAS pattern: Uncertainty-first design
uncertain_result = analyze_sentiment_with_uncertainty(
    text, 
    context, 
    uncertainty_config
)
```

### Fail-Aware Design Pattern

System designed to acknowledge and work with limitations:

```python
class UncertaintyAwareAnalysis:
    def analyze(self, input_data: Any) -> Union[AnalysisResult, UncertaintyWarning]:
        competence = self.assess_competence(input_data.domain)
        
        if competence.expected_accuracy < self.minimum_threshold:
            return UncertaintyWarning(
                message="Analysis domain exceeds system competence",
                suggested_actions=["Seek domain expert validation", "Lower confidence threshold"],
                competence_estimate=competence
            )
        
        return self.perform_analysis_with_uncertainty(input_data, competence)
```

### Transparent Uncertainty Pattern

All uncertainty reasoning explicitly documented and accessible:

```python
@dataclass
class ExplainableUncertaintyResult:
    result: Any
    confidence: AdvancedConfidenceScore
    reasoning_chain: List[ReasoningStep]
    alternative_interpretations: List[AlternativeResult]
    uncertainty_visualization: UncertaintyPlot
    
    def explain_uncertainty(self) -> str:
        """Human-readable explanation of uncertainty sources and reasoning"""
```

This uncertainty architecture transforms KGAS from a system that produces confident but potentially unreliable results into one that provides honest, calibrated, and actionable uncertainty information that enhances research validity and decision-making quality.
