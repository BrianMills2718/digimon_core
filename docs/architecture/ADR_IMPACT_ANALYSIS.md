## Overview

This document analyzes the cascade effects of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) throughout the KGAS system, showing how individual architectural decisions create ripple effects that influence design, implementation, and system behavior across multiple components.

## Primary Architectural Decision Cascades

### 1. ADR-001: Contract-First Tool Interface → System-Wide Impact

**Core Decision**: All tools implement standardized `ToolRequest`/`ToolResult` contracts

**Cascade Effects**:
```
ADR-001 (Contract-First Design)
├── ADR-014 (Error Handling) → Standardized error contracts required
├── ADR-007 (Uncertainty) → Confidence scoring integrated into ToolResult
├── ADR-010 (Quality System) → Quality metrics standardized across tools
├── ADR-008 (Core Services) → ServiceManager pattern for tool integration
├── Agent Interface → Enables intelligent tool orchestration
├── Cross-Modal Analysis → Consistent interfaces enable format conversion
├── MCP Integration → Tools automatically exposable via protocol
└── Testing Strategy → Contract-based integration testing possible
```

**System-Wide Implications**:
- **All tools** must implement the unified interface (affects T01-T121)
- **Agent orchestration** becomes possible through standardized contracts
- **Error handling** follows consistent patterns across the entire system
- **Testing approach** shifts to contract-based validation
- **Future tool development** constrained by contract requirements

### 2. ADR-009: Bi-Store Architecture → Data Flow Cascade

**Core Decision**: Neo4j for graph/vectors + SQLite for operational metadata

**Cascade Effects**:
```
ADR-009 (Bi-Store Strategy)
├── ADR-003 (Vector Store) → Neo4j native vectors eliminate external VDB
├── ADR-008 (Core Services) → DataManager coordinates dual storage

└── Development Complexity → Developers must understand both systems
```

**System-Wide Implications**:
- **All data operations** must consider both databases
- **Entity IDs** must remain consistent across stores

## Cross-Cutting Impact Patterns

### Error Handling Propagation Pattern
```
ADR-014 (Fail-Fast) → ADR-001 (Contracts) → ADR-009 (Bi-Store) → All Tools
```
Every tool must implement standardized error handling that coordinates across databases and provides complete research-appropriate error information.

### Uncertainty Propagation Pattern
```
ADR-007 (CERQual) → ADR-001 (Contracts) → ADR-010 (Quality) → All Analysis
```
Uncertainty flows through every analytical operation, from initial tool execution through cross-modal analysis to final output.

### Academic Standards Pattern
```
ADR-011 (Academic) → ADR-014 (Fail-Fast) → ADR-007 (Uncertainty) → Research Quality
```
Academic research requirements drive fail-fast transparency and sophisticated uncertainty quantification throughout the system.

### Service Integration Pattern
```
ADR-008 (Services) → ADR-001 (Contracts) → ADR-009 (Bi-Store) → System Coherence
```
Core services coordinate tool execution, data storage, and cross-cutting concerns through standardized contracts.

## Architectural Tensions and Resolutions

**Impact**: System achieves sophisticated analytical capabilities while maintaining deployment simplicity.

### 2. Performance vs. Correctness Tension

**Tension**: Academic research prioritizes correctness and transparency over raw performance.

**Resolution Strategy**:
- **ADR-011 (Academic Focus)**: Explicitly chooses flexibility over performance

## Future ADR Impact Considerations

### When Adding New ADRs, Consider:

- **Error Handling Changes**: Impacts system-wide reliability patterns
- **Uncertainty Framework Changes**: Affects academic output quality

## Monitoring ADR Health

### Red Flags for ADR Conflicts:

2. **Performance patches** that undermine academic research focus
3. **Error handling workarounds** that introduce silent failures
4. **Tool implementations** that bypass contract requirements

### ADR Alignment Validation:
- Regular architecture reviews against ADR compliance
- Implementation validation against architectural decisions
- Performance monitoring that respects academic research priorities
- Quality assurance that maintains uncertainty quantification standards
