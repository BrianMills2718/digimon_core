# ADR-001: Contract-First Tool Interface Design

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Partially Implemented - 10 tools use legacy interfaces, 9 tools have unified interface, contract-first design remains architectural goal  
**Deciders**: Development Team  
**Context**: Tool integration failures due to incompatible interfaces

---

## 🎯 **Decision**

**Use contract-first design for all tool interfaces with theory schema integration**

All tools must implement standardized contracts with theory schema support to enable agent-orchestrated workflows and cross-modal analysis.

---

## 🚨 **Problem**

### **Current Issues**
- **API Incompatibility**: Tools have different calling signatures and return formats
- **Integration Failures**: Tools tested in isolation, breaks discovered at agent runtime
- **No Theory Integration**: Theoretical concepts defined but not consistently used in processing
- **Agent Complexity**: Agent needs complex logic to handle different tool interfaces

### **Root Cause**
- **"Build First, Integrate Later"**: Tools built independently without shared contracts
- **No Interface Standards**: Each tool evolved its own API without coordination
- **Missing Theory Awareness**: Processing pipeline doesn't consistently use theoretical foundations

---

## 💡 **Trade-off Analysis**

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Keep Status Quo (Tool-Specific Interfaces)
- **Pros**:
  - No migration effort required
  - Tools remain independent and specialized
  - Developers familiar with existing patterns
  - Quick to add new tools without constraints
  
- **Cons**:
  - Integration complexity grows exponentially with tool count
  - Agent orchestration requires complex adapter logic
  - No consistent error handling or confidence tracking
  - Theory integration would require per-tool implementation
  - Testing each tool combination separately

#### Option 2: Retrofit with Adapters
- **Pros**:
  - Preserve existing tool implementations
  - Gradual migration possible
  - Lower initial development effort
  - Can maintain backward compatibility
  
- **Cons**:
  - Adapter layer adds performance overhead
  - Theory integration still difficult
  - Two patterns to maintain (native + adapted)
  - Technical debt accumulates
  - Doesn't solve root cause of integration issues

#### Option 3: Contract-First Design [SELECTED]
- **Pros**:
  - Clean, consistent interfaces across all tools
  - Theory integration built into contract
  - Enables intelligent agent orchestration
  - Simplified testing and validation
  - Future tools automatically compatible
  - Cross-modal analysis becomes straightforward
  
- **Cons**:
  - Significant refactoring of existing tools
  - Higher upfront design effort
  - Team learning curve for new patterns
  - Risk of over-engineering contracts

#### Option 4: Microservice Architecture
- **Pros**:
  - Tools completely decoupled
  - Independent scaling and deployment
  - Technology agnostic (tools in any language)
  - Industry-standard pattern
  
- **Cons**:
  - Massive complexity increase for research platform
  - Network overhead for local processing
  - Distributed system challenges
  - Overkill for single-user academic use case

### Decision Rationale

Contract-First Design (Option 3) was selected because:

1. **Agent Enablement**: Standardized interfaces are essential for intelligent agent orchestration of tool workflows.

2. **Theory Integration**: Built-in support for theory schemas ensures consistent application of domain knowledge.

3. **Cross-Modal Requirements**: Consistent interfaces enable seamless conversion between graph, table, and vector representations.

4. **Research Quality**: Standardized confidence scoring and provenance tracking improve research reproducibility.

5. **Long-term Maintenance**: While initial effort is higher, the reduced integration complexity pays dividends over time.

6. **Testing Efficiency**: Integration tests can validate tool combinations systematically rather than ad-hoc.

### When to Reconsider

This decision should be revisited if:
- Moving from research platform to production service
- Need to integrate external tools not under our control
- Performance overhead of contracts exceeds 10%
- Team size grows beyond 5 developers
- Requirements shift from batch to real-time processing

The contract abstraction provides flexibility to evolve the implementation while maintaining interface stability.

---

## ✅ **Selected Solution**

### **Contract-First Tool Interface**
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ToolRequest:
    """Immutable contract for ALL tool inputs"""
    input_data: Any
    theory_schema: Optional[TheorySchema] = None
    concept_library: Optional[MasterConceptLibrary] = None
    options: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    
@dataclass(frozen=True)  
class ToolResult:
    """Immutable contract for ALL tool outputs"""
    status: Literal["success", "error"]
    data: Any
    confidence: ConfidenceScore  # From ADR-004
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    provenance: ProvenanceRecord

class KGASTool(ABC):
    """Contract all tools MUST implement"""
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, request: ToolRequest) -> ToolResult:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_theory_compatibility(self) -> List[str]:
        """Return list of theory schema names this tool supports"""
        
    @abstractmethod 
    def get_input_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return JSON schema for expected input_data format"""
        
    @abstractmethod

## ADR-002 {#adr-002}

**Source File**: `docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-002-Pipeline-Orchestrator-Architecture.md`

**Doc status**: Living – auto-checked by doc-governance CI

# ADR-002: PipelineOrchestrator Architecture

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implemented 2025-01-15

## Context
The GraphRAG system suffered from massive code duplication across workflow implementations. Each phase (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3) had separate workflow files with 70-95% duplicate execution logic, making maintenance impossible and introducing bugs.

### Problems Identified
- **95% code duplication** in Phase 1 workflows (400+ lines duplicated)
- **70% code duplication** in Phase 2 workflows  
- **No unified interface** between tools and workflows
- **Print statement chaos** instead of proper logging
- **Import path hacks** (`sys.path.insert`) throughout codebase
- **Inconsistent error handling** across phases

### Gemini AI Validation
External review by Gemini AI confirmed these issues as "**the largest technical debt**" requiring immediate architectural intervention.

## Decision
Implement a unified **PipelineOrchestrator** architecture with the following components:

### 1. Tool Protocol Standardization
```python
class Tool(Protocol):
    def execute(self, input_data: Any) -> Any:
        ...
```

### 2. Tool Adapter Pattern
- `PDFLoaderAdapter`, `TextChunkerAdapter`, `SpacyNERAdapter`
- `RelationshipExtractorAdapter`, `EntityBuilderAdapter`, `EdgeBuilderAdapter`  
- `PageRankAdapter`, `MultiHopQueryAdapter`
- Bridges existing tools to unified protocol

### 3. Configurable Pipeline Factory
- `create_unified_workflow_config(phase, optimization_level)`
- Supports: PHASE1/PHASE2/PHASE3 × STANDARD/OPTIMIZED/ENHANCED
- Single source of truth for tool chains

### 4. Unified Execution Engine
- `PipelineOrchestrator.execute(document_paths, queries)`
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Replaces all duplicate workflow logic

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **95% reduction** in Phase 1 workflow duplication
- ✅ **70% reduction** in Phase 2 workflow duplication  
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for all pipeline execution
- ✅ **Type-safe interfaces** between components
- ✅ **Proper logging** throughout system
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** maintained

### Negative
- Requires adapter layer for existing tools
- Initial implementation complexity
- Learning curve for new unified interface

## Implementation Evidence
```bash
# Verification commands
python -c "from src.core.pipeline_orchestrator import PipelineOrchestrator; print('✅ Available')"
python -c "from src.core.tool_adapters import PDFLoaderAdapter; print('✅ Tool adapters working')"
python -c "from src.tools.phase1.vertical_slice_workflow import VerticalSliceWorkflow; w=VerticalSliceWorkflow(); print(f'✅ Uses orchestrator: {hasattr(w, \"orchestrator\")}')"
```

**Results:** All verification tests pass ✅

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Incremental Refactoring
- **Rejected:** Would not address root cause of duplication
- **Issue:** Technical debt would continue accumulating

### 2. Complete Rewrite
- **Rejected:** Too risky, would break existing functionality
- **Issue:** No backward compatibility guarantee

### 3. Plugin Architecture
- **Rejected:** Overly complex for current needs
- **Issue:** Would introduce unnecessary abstraction layers

# ADR-003: Vector Store Consolidation

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team, advised by external architectural review.

---

## 🎯 **Decision**

**Replace the tri-store data platform (Neo4j + SQLite + Qdrant) with a simplified bi-store architecture (Neo4j + SQLite). The native vector index within Neo4j (version 5.13+) will be used for all embedding storage and approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) search, eliminating the need for a separate Qdrant instance.**

---

## 🚨 **Problem Context**

The previous target architecture employed three separate data stores:
1.  **Neo4j**: For graph data.
2.  **Qdrant**: For vector embeddings.
3.  **SQLite**: For the PII vault and workflow state.

This tri-store model introduced significant architectural complexity, most notably the **"Tri-Store Consistency Risk"** identified during external review. Because Neo4j is transactional (ACID-compliant) and Qdrant is not, ensuring data consistency required a complex **Transactional Outbox Pattern** with compensating transactions and a periodic reconciliation job.

This created several operational liabilities:
-   **Increased Complexity**: Required dedicated services (`OutboxService`, `ReconciliationService`) just to maintain data integrity.
-   **Eventual Consistency Latency**: The reconciliation window could lead to periods of data inconsistency (e.g., "orphan" vectors).
-   **Maintenance Overhead**: More moving parts to monitor, test, and maintain.
-   **Deployment Complexity**: Managing an additional Qdrant instance and its associated Docker configurations.

Given the project's context—a **Python-only, local, academic research platform**—this level of complexity was not justified by the benefits, especially when a simpler, more integrated solution became available.

---

## 💡 **Drivers for Change**

The primary driver is the maturation of **Neo4j's native vector search capabilities**. As of version 5.13, Neo4j includes a production-ready HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index that provides:
-   **High-Performance ANN Search**: Sub-second query times for millions of vectors, sufficient for this project's scale.
-   **ACID Guarantees**: Vector writes are part of the same transaction as graph writes. A transaction rollback automatically rolls back both the graph data and the vector index update.
-   **Operational Simplicity**: No separate vector database to manage.

This technical improvement directly nullifies the original reason for including Qdrant.

---

## ✅ **Selected Solution: Bi-Store Architecture**

1.  **Data Stores**:
    -   **Neo4j**: Will store both the property graph and the vector embeddings for all entities. An `HNSW` index will be created on the `embedding` property of `:Entity` nodes.
    -   **SQLite**: Will continue to be used for the encrypted PII vault and workflow state management, maintaining the bi-store architecture principle.

2.  **Vector Store Abstraction**:
    -   An abstract `VectorStore` protocol (interface) will be defined in Python.
    -   A concrete `Neo4jVectorStore` class will implement this interface using Cypher queries against the native vector index.
    -   This **Strategy Pattern** isolates the vector storage logic, making it easy to swap back to a dedicated store like Qdrant in the future if scalability demands it, without changing the application logic.

3.  **Code Removal**:
    -   The `OutboxService` and `ReconciliationService` will be deleted.
    -   All direct dependencies on the `qdrant-client` will be removed.
    -   Qdrant will be removed from all Docker compose files.

### **Consequences**

**Positive**:
-   ✅ **Architectural Simplification**: Eliminates an entire service and the complex cross-service consistency logic.
-   ✅ **Strong Consistency**: Vector and graph data are now updated atomically within the same transaction. The orphan-reference problem is eliminated.
-   ✅ **Reduced Maintenance**: Fewer code components and operational processes to manage.
-   ✅ **Future-Proof**: The `VectorStore` interface provides a clean extension point for future scalability needs.

**Negative**:
-   **Scalability Ceiling**: Neo4j's native index may not perform as well as a dedicated store like Qdrant at extremely large scales (>100M vectors). This is an acceptable trade-off for this project's scope.
-   **Single Point of Failure**: Consolidating on Neo4j means its availability is even more critical. This is managed by standard backup procedures (e.g., nightly dumps).

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Plan (High-Level)**

1.  **Upgrade Neo4j**: Ensure the environment uses Neo4j v5.13 or newer.
2.  **Create Index**: Add a `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` command to the database schema setup.
3.  **Abstract Interface**: Implement the `VectorStore` protocol and the `Neo4jVectorStore` class.
4.  **Migrate Data**: Write a one-time script to export vectors from Qdrant and load them into the `embedding` property of the corresponding Neo4j nodes.
5.  **Refactor Code**: Replace all calls to the Qdrant client with the new `vector_store` interface.
6.  **Delete Old Code**: Remove all Qdrant-related files and configurations.
7.  **Update Tests**: Modify unit and integration tests to rely only on Neo4j.

---

---

## 🔄 **Trade-off Analysis**

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Keep Tri-Store Architecture (Neo4j + SQLite + Qdrant)
- **Pros**:
  - Best-in-class vector search performance with Qdrant
  - Independent scaling of vector operations
  - Specialized vector database features (filtering, metadata)
  - Proven architecture pattern for large-scale systems
  
- **Cons**:
  - Complex consistency management across three stores
  - Requires Transactional Outbox Pattern implementation
  - Additional operational overhead (monitoring, backups, updates)
  - Higher infrastructure costs
  - Risk of data inconsistency during reconciliation windows

#### Option 2: Single Neo4j Database (Graph + Vectors + Metadata)
- **Pros**:
  - Simplest possible architecture
  - Perfect consistency (single ACID store)
  - Minimal operational overhead
  - Lowest cost
  
- **Cons**:
  - Poor text/document storage capabilities
  - Limited full-text search compared to dedicated solutions
  - Would require complex JSON storage for metadata
  - Performance concerns with mixed workloads

#### Option 3: Bi-Store Architecture (Neo4j + SQLite) [SELECTED]
- **Pros**:
  - Balanced complexity - simpler than tri-store
  - Strong consistency within each domain (graph+vectors atomic)
  - Leverages Neo4j 5.13+ native vector capabilities
  - SQLite excellent for metadata and workflow state
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Future migration path via VectorStore abstraction
  
- **Cons**:
  - Vector search may not scale beyond ~10M embeddings
  - Still requires cross-database coordination for some operations
  - Neo4j becomes more critical (single point of failure for core data)

#### Option 4: Alternative Bi-Store (PostgreSQL with pgvector + Neo4j)
- **Pros**:
  - PostgreSQL more feature-rich than SQLite
  - pgvector provides good vector search
  - Could consolidate all non-graph data
  - Better concurrent access than SQLite
  
- **Cons**:
  - Adds PostgreSQL as new dependency
  - More complex than SQLite for single-user research platform
  - Overkill for current scale requirements
  - Would still need consistency management

### Decision Rationale

The bi-store architecture (Option 3) was selected because:

1. **Appropriate Complexity**: Eliminates the most complex aspect (tri-store consistency) while maintaining clean separation between graph and metadata storage.

2. **Scale-Appropriate**: For a research platform processing thousands (not millions) of documents, Neo4j's native vector index is more than sufficient.

3. **Consistency Benefits**: Atomic updates to graph + vectors eliminates entire classes of bugs and complexity.

4. **Future Flexibility**: The VectorStore abstraction allows migration to Qdrant later if scale demands it, without major refactoring.

5. **Operational Simplicity**: One less service to deploy, monitor, backup, and maintain.

6. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces infrastructure requirements while meeting all functional needs.

### When to Reconsider

This decision should be revisited if:
- Vector corpus grows beyond 10M embeddings
- Query latency for vector search exceeds 500ms consistently  
- Need for advanced vector search features (hybrid search, filtering)
- Moving from single-user to multi-tenant architecture
- Require real-time vector index updates at high throughput

The VectorStore abstraction ensures this future migration would be straightforward, involving only the implementation of a new concrete class without changes to application logic.

## ADR-004 {#adr-004}

**Source File**: `docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-004-Normative-Confidence-Score-Ontology.md`

# ADR-004: Normative Confidence Score Ontology

*Status: **SUPERSEDED by ADR-007** - 2025-01-18 (original), 2025-07-20 (superseded)*

## Supersession Notice

This ADR has been superseded by [ADR-007: CERQual-Based Uncertainty Architecture](./ADR-007-uncertainty-metrics.md). The simple confidence score approach described here was found insufficient for academic social science research requirements. ADR-007 introduces a more sophisticated CERQual-based uncertainty quantification framework.

## Context

KGAS currently allows each extraction or analysis tool to output its own notion of *confidence* or *uncertainty*. This flexibility has led to incompatible semantics across tools (e.g., some use logits, others probabilities, others custom scales). The external architectural review identified this as a critical source of "capability sprawl" and potential integration breakage.

## Decision

1. A single, mandatory Pydantic model named `ConfidenceScore` becomes part of the canonical contract system.
2. All tool contracts **MUST** express confidence and related uncertainty using this model—no bespoke fields.
3. The model fields are:
   ```python
   class ConfidenceScore(BaseModel):
       value: confloat(ge=0.0, le=1.0)  # Normalised probability-like confidence
       evidence_weight: PositiveInt      # Number of independent evidence items supporting the value
       propagation_method: Literal[
           "bayesian_evidence_power",
           "dempster_shafer",
           "min_max",
       ]
   ```
4. The `propagation_method` **must** be recorded in provenance metadata for every derived result, enabling reproducible downstream comparisons.
5. A tool that cannot currently compute a valid confidence must set `value=None` and `propagation_method="unknown"`, and raise a contract warning.

## Consequences

* Contract System: The `contract-system.md` documentation is updated to reference this ontology.
* Quality Service: Must be refactored to select an aggregation algorithm based on `propagation_method`.
* Migration: Existing tools will undergo a one-time update to conform to the new model.
* Future Work: Support for additional propagation methods will be added via enumeration expansion, requiring no schema change.

## Alternatives Considered

* **Leave-as-is:** Rejected—does not solve integration problems.
* **Free-text confidence fields:** Rejected—unverifiable and non-interoperable.

# ADR-006: Cross-Modal Analysis Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Context**: Need for fluid analysis across graph, table, and vector representations

## Context

Academic social science research requires different analytical approaches depending on the research question. Graph analysis excels at relationship exploration, table analysis at statistical operations, and vector analysis at semantic similarity. However, existing systems force researchers to choose one representation and lose the benefits of others.

## Decision

We will implement a cross-modal analysis architecture with **synchronized views** rather than lossy conversions between representations.

### Core Components

1. **Unified Entity Identity**: Same entity ID across all representations (graph nodes, table rows, vector embeddings)
2. **Cross-Modal Converter**: Intelligent conversion between representations with full provenance tracking
3. **Semantic Preservation**: Non-lossy encoding that maintains complete meaning during transformations
4. **Mode Selection**: LLM-driven optimal representation selection based on research questions

### Architecture Pattern

```
Research Question → Optimal Mode Selection → Cross-Modal Processing → Source-Linked Results
```

## Rationale

### Synchronized Views Benefits
- **Complete Analytical Power**: Researchers can use the optimal tool for each sub-question
- **Information Preservation**: No loss of meaning during format conversions
- **Cumulative Insights**: Each analysis enriches the dataset for subsequent analyses
- **Source Traceability**: All results remain traceable to original documents

### Alternative Approaches Rejected
- **Single Mode Lock-in**: Forces suboptimal analysis for many research questions
- **Lossy Conversions**: Hash-based encoding loses semantic information
- **Disconnected Stores**: Same entities have different IDs across representations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Researchers can fluidly move between analytical modes
- Complete preservation of semantic meaning
- Unified provenance tracking across all representations
- Optimal tool selection for each research question

### Negative
- Increased system complexity compared to single-mode approaches
- Additional storage requirements for maintaining synchronized views
- More complex identity management across representations

### Neutral
- Requires sophisticated cross-modal conversion algorithms
- Performance considerations for maintaining synchronization

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- CrossModalEntity system with persistent IDs
- Intelligent conversion strategies between all representation pairs
- Provenance tracking through all transformations
- Quality metrics for conversion validation

### Quality Targets
- ≥80% semantic preservation in cross-modal transformations
- Complete identity consistency across representations
- Full bidirectional transformation capability

## Validation Evidence

This architectural decision has been validated through comprehensive implementation and testing:

**See**: [Validation Evidence](adr-003-cross-modal-analysis/validation/stress-test-evidence.md)

Key validation results:
- 100% semantic preservation achieved (exceeds 80% target)
- Complete implementation with CrossModalEntity system
- Validated with real academic research scenario
- Third-party confirmation of approach superiority

# ADR-007: CERQual-Based Uncertainty Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-20  
**Context**: Need for principled uncertainty quantification in academic social science research

## Context

Academic social science research requires rigorous uncertainty quantification to ensure research validity and reproducibility. LLM-based analysis tools introduce multiple sources of uncertainty (epistemic, aleatoric, model-based) that must be quantified and propagated through analytical pipelines. Standard software engineering confidence scores are insufficient for academic rigor.

## Decision

We will implement a **CERQual-based uncertainty quantification framework** with four-layer architecture and configurable complexity.

### Framework Choice: CERQual
- **CERQual**: Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research
- **Academic Standard**: Established methodology for social science uncertainty assessment
- **Domain Fit**: Specifically designed for discourse analysis and qualitative research

### Four-Layer Architecture

1. **Contextual Entity Resolution**: Dynamic disambiguation with uncertainty
2. **Temporal Knowledge Graph**: Time-bounded confidence decay
3. **Bayesian Pipeline**: Dependency modeling and uncertainty propagation
4. **Distribution Preservation**: Full uncertainty distribution maintenance

### Configurable Complexity
- **Simple**: Basic confidence scores for immediate usability
- **Standard**: CERQual assessment with moderate detail
- **Advanced**: Full Bayesian uncertainty propagation
- **Research**: Complete distributional analysis for publication

## Rationale

### CERQual Framework Benefits
- **Academic Recognition**: Established methodology accepted in social science journals
- **Domain Appropriate**: Designed specifically for qualitative discourse analysis
- **Quality Assessment**: Provides structured approach to evidence quality evaluation
- **Research Validity**: Enhances reproducibility and research rigor

### Four-Layer Approach Benefits
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses all major uncertainty sources
- **Propagation Tracking**: Maintains uncertainty through complex analytical chains
- **Configurable Detail**: Researchers can choose appropriate complexity level
- **Academic Standards**: Meets requirements for academic publication

### Alternative Approaches Rejected
- **Simple Confidence Scores**: Insufficient for academic rigor
- **Engineering Reliability Metrics**: Not aligned with social science methodology
- **Single-Layer Uncertainty**: Fails to capture uncertainty propagation complexity

## Consequences

### Positive
- Academic research meets publication standards for uncertainty reporting
- Configurable complexity allows adaptation to research needs
- Comprehensive uncertainty propagation through analytical pipelines
- Integration with established academic methodologies

### Negative
- Increased computational complexity for advanced uncertainty modes
- Additional metadata storage requirements
- Learning curve for researchers unfamiliar with uncertainty quantification

### Neutral
- Requires calibration for different domains and LLM models
- Performance trade-offs between uncertainty detail and processing speed

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- CERQual framework integration with all analytical components
- Four-layer uncertainty propagation architecture
- Configurable complexity levels (simple to advanced)
- Uncertainty-aware tool contracts for all operations

### Quality Targets
- ≥99% statistical robustness through integration pipelines
- Proper calibration for social science discourse analysis
- Uncertainty propagation without significant degradation
- Academic standards compliance for research publication

## Validation Evidence

This architectural decision has been validated through comprehensive research and testing:

**See**: [Framework Validation](adr-004-uncertainty-metrics/validation/framework-validation.md)

Key validation results:
- CERQual framework validated for social science discourse analysis
- Four-layer architecture conceptually validated with implementation tiers
- 99% statistical robustness maintained through integration pipeline
- Comprehensive research foundation with 18 supporting research files
- Successfully applied to real academic research scenario

## ADR-008 {#adr-008}

**Source File**: `docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-008-Core-Service-Architecture.md`

# ADR-008: Core Service Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: System requires coordinated services for identity management, provenance tracking, quality assessment, and workflow state management.

## Decision

We will implement a **Service Manager pattern** with dependency injection to coordinate four core services:

1. **IdentityService (T107)**: Entity mention management and resolution
2. **ProvenanceService (T110)**: Operation tracking and lineage  
3. **QualityService (T111)**: Confidence assessment and propagation
4. **WorkflowStateService (T121)**: Workflow checkpoints and recovery

```python
class ServiceManager:
    """Singleton service coordinator with dependency injection"""
    
    @property
    def identity_service(self) -> IdentityService:
        return self._get_service('identity', IdentityService)
    
    @property
    def provenance_service(self) -> ProvenanceService:
        return self._get_service('provenance', ProvenanceService)
```

## Rationale

### **Why Service Manager Pattern?**

**1. Academic Research Complexity**: Research workflows require coordinated services that must maintain consistency across entity resolution, provenance tracking, and quality assessment.

**2. Cross-Service Dependencies**: 
- Identity service needs provenance for entity tracking
- Quality service needs provenance for confidence history
- Workflow state needs all services for checkpoint recovery

**3. Configuration Management**: Single point for service configuration and lifecycle management.

**4. Testing Isolation**: Services can be individually tested while maintaining integration capabilities.

### **Why These Four Services?**

**Identity Service**: Academic research requires consistent entity resolution across documents. Without this, "John Smith" in document A and "J. Smith" in document B may be treated as different entities, corrupting analysis.

**Provenance Service**: Academic integrity demands complete audit trails. Every extracted fact must be traceable to its source for citation verification and reproducibility.

**Quality Service**: Research requires confidence assessment that propagates through analysis pipelines. Quality degradation must be tracked to maintain result validity.

**Workflow State Service**: Long-running research workflows need checkpointing and recovery. Academic projects often process hundreds of documents over days/weeks.

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Monolithic Service Architecture**
- **Rejected**: Creates tight coupling, difficult testing, and massive service complexity
- **Problem**: Single service would handle identity, provenance, quality, and state - violating separation of concerns

### **2. Direct Service Instantiation (No Manager)**
- **Rejected**: Creates circular dependencies and configuration fragmentation
- **Problem**: Each component would need to instantiate its own service dependencies

### **3. Event-Driven Service Architecture**
- **Rejected**: Over-engineering for academic research tool requirements
- **Problem**: Adds complexity without matching the academic workflow patterns

### **4. Microservices Architecture**
- **Rejected**: Academic research tools need local, single-node execution
- **Problem**: Network boundaries incompatible with local research environment

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Consistent Service Access**: All components access services through same interface
- **Dependency Injection**: Services can be mocked/replaced for testing
- **Configuration Centralization**: Single point for service configuration
- **Resource Management**: Controlled service lifecycle and cleanup

### **Negative**
- **Singleton Complexity**: Service manager must handle thread safety
- **Service Interdependencies**: Changes to one service may affect others
- **Initialization Ordering**: Services must be initialized in correct dependency order

## Implementation Requirements

### **Service Protocol Compliance**
All services must implement the standard `CoreService` interface:

```python
class CoreService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> ServiceResponse:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def health_check(self) -> ServiceResponse:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def cleanup(self) -> ServiceResponse:
        pass
```

### **Thread Safety**
Service manager must be thread-safe using proper locking mechanisms for concurrent access.

### **Error Handling**
Service failures must propagate clearly with recovery guidance rather than silent degradation.

### **Configuration Integration**
Services must integrate with the centralized configuration system (ADR-009 dependency).

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] All four core services implement `CoreService` interface
- [ ] Service manager provides thread-safe singleton access
- [ ] Service dependencies are properly injected
- [ ] Service health checks work independently and collectively
- [ ] Service cleanup prevents resource leaks
- [ ] Error propagation works correctly across service boundaries

## Related ADRs

- **ADR-009**: Bi-Store Database Strategy (services use both Neo4j and SQLite)
- **ADR-010**: Quality System Design (quality service implementation details)
- **ADR-014**: Error Handling Strategy (service error propagation)

This service architecture provides the foundation for coordinated, reliable academic research capabilities while maintaining the simplicity appropriate for single-node research environments.

# ADR-009: Bi-Store Database Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: System requires both graph analysis capabilities and operational metadata storage for academic research workflows.

## Decision

We will implement a **bi-store architecture** using:

1. **Neo4j (v5.13+)**: Primary graph database for entities, relationships, and vector embeddings
2. **SQLite**: Operational metadata database for provenance, workflow state, and PII vault

```python
# Unified access pattern
class DataManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.neo4j = Neo4jManager()      # Graph operations
        self.sqlite = SQLiteManager()    # Metadata operations
    
    def store_entity(self, entity_data):
        # Store graph data in Neo4j
        entity_id = self.neo4j.create_entity(entity_data)
        
        # Store operational metadata in SQLite
        self.sqlite.log_provenance(entity_id, "entity_creation", entity_data)
        
        return entity_id
```

## Rationale

### **Why Two Databases Instead of One?**

**1. Graph Analysis Requirements**: Academic research requires complex graph operations:
- **Entity relationship analysis**: "Find all researchers influenced by Foucault"
- **Community detection**: Identify research clusters and schools of thought
- **Path analysis**: "How is theory A connected to theory B?"
- **Centrality analysis**: Identify most influential concepts/researchers

**Neo4j excels at these operations with Cypher queries like:**
```cypher
MATCH (a:Entity {name: "Foucault"})-[:INFLUENCES*1..3]->(influenced)
RETURN influenced.name, length(path) as degrees_of_separation
```

**2. Operational Metadata Requirements**: Academic integrity requires detailed operational tracking:
- **Provenance tracking**: Complete audit trail of every operation
- **Workflow state**: Long-running research workflow checkpoints
- **PII protection**: Encrypted storage of sensitive personal information
- **Configuration state**: Tool settings and parameter tracking

**SQLite excels at these operations with relational queries and ACID transactions.**

**3. Performance Optimization**: 
- **Graph queries** on Neo4j: Optimized for traversal and pattern matching
- **Metadata queries** on SQLite: Optimized for joins, aggregations, and transactional consistency

### **Why Not Single Database Solutions?**

**Neo4j Only**:
- ❌ **Poor relational operations**: Complex joins and aggregations are inefficient
- ❌ **Metadata bloat**: Operational metadata clutters graph with non-analytical data
- ❌ **ACID limitations**: Neo4j transactions less robust for operational metadata
- ❌ **PII security**: Graph databases not optimized for encrypted key-value storage

**SQLite Only**:
- ❌ **Graph operations**: Recursive CTEs cannot match Neo4j's graph algorithm performance
- ❌ **Vector operations**: No native vector similarity search capabilities
- ❌ **Scalability**: Graph traversals become exponentially slow with data growth
- ❌ **Cypher equivalent**: No domain-specific query language for graph patterns

**PostgreSQL Only**:
- ❌ **Local deployment**: Requires server setup incompatible with academic research environments
- ❌ **Graph extensions**: Extensions like AGE add complexity without matching Neo4j performance
- ❌ **Vector search**: Extensions available but not as mature as Neo4j's native support

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Neo4j + PostgreSQL**
- **Rejected**: PostgreSQL server requirement incompatible with single-node academic research
- **Problem**: Requires database server administration and configuration

### **2. Pure Neo4j with Metadata as Graph Nodes**
- **Rejected**: Creates graph pollution and performance degradation
- **Problem**: Provenance metadata would create millions of nodes unrelated to research analysis

### **3. Pure SQLite with Graph Tables**
- **Rejected**: Recursive graph queries become prohibitively slow
- **Problem**: Academic research requires complex graph analysis not feasible in pure SQL

### **4. In-Memory Graph (NetworkX) + SQLite**
- **Rejected**: Memory limitations prevent analysis of large research corpora
- **Problem**: Cannot handle 1000+ document research projects

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Optimal Performance**: Each database handles operations it's designed for
- **Data Separation**: Analytical data separate from operational metadata
- **Local Deployment**: Both databases support single-node academic environments
- **Specialized Tooling**: Can use Neo4j Browser for graph exploration, SQL tools for metadata
- **Vector Integration**: Neo4j v5.13+ native vector support for embeddings

### **Negative**
- **Complexity**: Two database systems to maintain and coordinate
- **Transaction Coordination**: Cross-database transactions require careful coordination
- **Data Synchronization**: Entity IDs must remain consistent across both stores
- **Backup Complexity**: Two separate backup and recovery procedures required

## Data Distribution Strategy

### **Neo4j Store**
```cypher
// Entities with vector embeddings
(:Entity {
    id: string,
    canonical_name: string,
    entity_type: string,
    confidence: float,
    embedding: vector[384]
})

// Relationships
(:Entity)-[:INFLUENCES {confidence: float, source: string}]->(:Entity)

// Documents
(:Document {id: string, title: string, source: string})

// Vector indexes for similarity search
CREATE VECTOR INDEX entity_embedding_index 
FOR (e:Entity) ON (e.embedding)
```

### **SQLite Store**
```sql
-- Complete provenance tracking
CREATE TABLE provenance (
    object_id TEXT,
    tool_id TEXT,
    operation TEXT,
    inputs JSON,
    outputs JSON,
    execution_time REAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Workflow state for long-running processes
CREATE TABLE workflow_states (
    workflow_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    state_data JSON,
    checkpoint_time TIMESTAMP
);

-- Encrypted PII storage
CREATE TABLE pii_vault (
    pii_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    ciphertext_b64 TEXT NOT NULL,
    nonce_b64 TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Transaction Coordination

For operations affecting both databases:

```python
@contextmanager
def distributed_transaction():
    """Coordinate transactions across Neo4j and SQLite"""
    neo4j_tx = None
    sqlite_tx = None
    
    try:
        # Start both transactions
        neo4j_session = neo4j_driver.session()
        neo4j_tx = neo4j_session.begin_transaction()
        sqlite_tx = sqlite_conn.begin()
        
        yield (neo4j_tx, sqlite_tx)
        
        # Commit both if successful
        neo4j_tx.commit()
        sqlite_tx.commit()
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Rollback both on any failure
        if neo4j_tx:
            neo4j_tx.rollback()
        if sqlite_tx:
            sqlite_tx.rollback()
        raise DistributedTransactionError(f"Transaction failed: {e}")
```

## Implementation Requirements

### **Consistency Guarantees**
- Entity IDs must be identical across both databases
- All graph operations must have corresponding provenance entries
- Transaction failures must rollback both databases

### **Performance Requirements**
- Graph queries: < 2 seconds for typical academic research patterns
- Metadata queries: < 500ms for provenance and workflow operations
- Cross-database coordination: < 100ms overhead

### **Backup and Recovery**
- Neo4j: Graph database dumps with entity/relationship preservation
- SQLite: File-based backups with transaction log consistency
- Coordinated restoration ensuring ID consistency

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Graph analysis queries perform within academic research requirements
- [ ] Metadata operations maintain ACID properties
- [ ] Cross-database entity ID consistency maintained
- [ ] Transaction coordination prevents partial failures
- [ ] Backup/recovery maintains data integrity across both stores
- [ ] Vector similarity search performs effectively on research corpora

## Related ADRs

- **ADR-008**: Core Service Architecture (services use both databases)
- **ADR-006**: Cross-Modal Analysis (requires graph and metadata coordination)
- **ADR-003**: Vector Store Consolidation (Neo4j vector capabilities)

## Implementation Status

This ADR describes the **target bi-store database architecture** - the intended Neo4j + SQLite design. For current database implementation status and data layer progress, see:

- **[Roadmap Overview](../../roadmap/ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md)** - Current database implementation status

This bi-store strategy optimizes for both analytical capabilities and operational reliability required for rigorous academic research while maintaining the simplicity appropriate for single-node research environments.

## ADR-010 {#adr-010}

**Source File**: `docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-010-Quality-System-Design.md`

# ADR-010: Quality System Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: Academic research requires systematic confidence tracking through multi-step processing pipelines while maintaining epistemic humility about extraction quality.

## Decision

We will implement a **confidence degradation system** that models uncertainty accumulation through processing pipelines:

```python
class QualityService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.quality_rules = {
            "pdf_loader": QualityRule(degradation_factor=0.95),
            "spacy_ner": QualityRule(degradation_factor=0.90),
            "relationship_extractor": QualityRule(degradation_factor=0.85),
            "entity_builder": QualityRule(degradation_factor=0.90)
        }
    
    def propagate_confidence(self, base_confidence: float, operation: str) -> float:
        """Apply degradation factor for processing step"""
        rule = self.quality_rules.get(operation)
        return base_confidence * rule.degradation_factor if rule else base_confidence
```

### **Core Principles**

1. **Epistemic Humility**: Each processing step introduces some uncertainty
2. **Degradation Modeling**: Confidence can only decrease or remain stable, never increase
3. **Quality Tiers**: HIGH (≥0.8), MEDIUM (≥0.5), LOW (<0.5) for filtering
4. **Provenance Integration**: Confidence tracked with complete processing history

## Rationale

### **Why Confidence Degradation?**

**1. Academic Epistemic Standards**: 
Research requires acknowledging uncertainty accumulation. Each processing step (PDF extraction → NLP → entity linking) introduces potential errors that compound.

**2. Processing Pipeline Reality**:
- **PDF extraction**: OCR errors, formatting issues (5% confidence loss)
- **NLP processing**: Language model limitations (10% confidence loss)  
- **Relationship extraction**: Context interpretation errors (15% confidence loss)
- **Entity building**: Identity resolution mistakes (10% confidence loss)

**3. Conservative Research Approach**:
Academic integrity demands conservative confidence estimates. Better to underestimate confidence than overestimate and produce false research conclusions.

**4. Filtering and Quality Control**:
Degraded confidence enables quality-based filtering. Researchers can choose to work only with HIGH confidence extractions (≥0.8) for critical analysis.

### **Why Not Bayesian Updates/Confidence Increases?**

**Current Decision Rationale**:

**1. Complexity vs. Benefit**: Bayesian updating requires:
- Prior probability distributions for each operation type
- Likelihood functions for evidence integration  
- Posterior calculation frameworks
- Extensive calibration on academic research data

**Academic research tool complexity tradeoff**: Simple degradation model provides adequate uncertainty tracking without the engineering complexity of full Bayesian inference.

**2. Evidence Integration Challenges**:
- **Different evidence types**: How do you combine NER confidence, relationship extraction confidence, and external validation?
- **Correlation issues**: Multiple extractions from same document are not independent evidence
- **Calibration requirements**: Bayesian updates require well-calibrated probability estimates

**3. Academic Use Case Alignment**:
Academic researchers primarily need to:
- Identify high-confidence extractions for analysis
- Understand uncertainty accumulation through pipelines  
- Filter low-confidence results from critical research

Simple degradation model serves these needs effectively.

## Current Implementation

### **Quality Rules**
```python
QualityRule(
    rule_id="nlp_processing",
    source_type="spacy_ner", 
    degradation_factor=0.9,   # 10% degradation
    min_confidence=0.1,
    description="NLP entity extraction"
)
```

### **Confidence Assessment**
```python
def assess_confidence(
    self,
    object_ref: str,
    base_confidence: float,
    factors: Dict[str, float] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Input validation (0.0-1.0 range)
    # Factor application (multiplicative degradation)
    # Quality tier determination (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
    # Assessment storage with timestamp
```

### **Quality Tiers**
- **HIGH**: confidence ≥ 0.8 (suitable for critical research analysis)
- **MEDIUM**: confidence ≥ 0.5 (suitable for exploratory research)  
- **LOW**: confidence < 0.5 (flagged for manual review)

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Bayesian Confidence Updates**
```python
# Rejected approach
def bayesian_update(prior_confidence, evidence_likelihood, evidence_strength):
    posterior = (evidence_likelihood * prior_confidence) / normalization_factor
    return min(1.0, posterior * evidence_strength)
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Calibration complexity**: Requires extensive calibration data for each operation type
- **Evidence correlation**: Multiple extractions from same source are not independent
- **Engineering overhead**: Significant complexity for uncertain academic research benefit
- **Domain expertise required**: Requires deep understanding of Bayesian inference for maintenance

### **2. Machine Learning Confidence Models**
```python
# Rejected approach  
class MLConfidencePredictor:
    def predict_confidence(self, extraction_features, context_features):
        return self.trained_model.predict([extraction_features, context_features])
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Training data requirements**: Requires large labeled dataset of extraction quality
- **Model maintenance**: ML models require retraining and performance monitoring
- **Explainability**: Academic researchers need interpretable confidence estimates
- **Generalization**: Models may not generalize across different research domains

### **3. Static Confidence (No Degradation)**
```python
# Rejected approach
def static_confidence(base_confidence):
    return base_confidence  # No change through pipeline
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Unrealistic**: Ignores error accumulation through processing pipelines
- **Academic standards**: Fails to acknowledge uncertainty introduction
- **Quality control**: Cannot distinguish between high-quality and degraded extractions

### **4. Expert-Defined Confidence Rules**
```python
# Rejected approach
def expert_confidence_rules(extraction_type, source_quality, context_factors):
    # Complex rule-based system with expert knowledge
    return calculate_confidence_from_rules(extraction_type, source_quality, context_factors)
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Maintenance complexity**: Requires domain expert involvement for rule updates
- **Rule interaction**: Complex interactions between rules difficult to predict
- **Scalability**: Cannot scale across different research domains and use cases

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Simple and interpretable**: Researchers can understand confidence degradation
- **Conservative approach**: Prevents overconfidence in automated extractions
- **Quality filtering**: Enables researchers to work with high-confidence data only
- **Minimal maintenance**: Simple degradation factors require minimal tuning

### **Negative**  
- **No confidence recovery**: Cannot account for confirming evidence from multiple sources
- **Linear degradation**: May not accurately model non-linear uncertainty interactions
- **Domain agnostic**: Same degradation factors across different research domains
- **Static factors**: Degradation factors not adaptive to actual extraction quality

## Future Evolution Considerations

**Note**: This ADR documents the current approach. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Evidence-based confidence adjustment**: Allow confidence increases with multiple confirming sources
2. **Domain-specific degradation**: Different factors for different research domains
3. **Adaptive factors**: Degradation factors based on actual extraction performance
4. **Hybrid approaches**: Combine degradation with limited Bayesian updates for specific cases

**However, any changes require**:
- Careful analysis of academic research requirements
- Validation that complexity increase provides meaningful research value
- Preservation of interpretability and maintainability
- Extensive testing to prevent confidence inflation

## Implementation Requirements

### **Degradation Factor Calibration**
- Factors based on empirical analysis of processing step error rates
- Regular validation against manual quality assessment
- Domain-specific adjustment capabilities

### **Quality Tier Thresholds**
- HIGH (≥0.8): Suitable for publication-quality research analysis
- MEDIUM (≥0.5): Suitable for exploratory research and hypothesis generation
- LOW (<0.5): Requires manual review before use in research

### **Confidence History Tracking**
- Complete audit trail of confidence changes through pipeline
- Integration with provenance service for full traceability
- Support for confidence-based filtering in research workflows

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Confidence values remain within 0.0-1.0 range through all operations
- [ ] Quality tiers correctly classify extraction reliability for research use
- [ ] Degradation factors reflect empirical processing step error rates
- [ ] Confidence history provides complete audit trail
- [ ] Quality-based filtering enables reliable research workflows
- [ ] System prevents confidence inflation while acknowledging uncertainty

1. **Correctness over performance**: Prioritize accurate results and reproducibility
2. **Flexibility over optimization**: Support diverse research methods and theories  
3. **Transparency over efficiency**: Full provenance and explainable processing
4. **Local deployment over scalability**: Single-node research environment focus

```python
# Academic research design principles in code
class AcademicResearchTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.priority_order = [
            "correctness",      # Accurate results for publication
            "reproducibility",  # Complete audit trails
            "flexibility",      # Support diverse research approaches
            "transparency",     # Explainable processing steps
            "local_deployment", # Single researcher environment
            "performance"       # Optimize only after above requirements met
        ]
```

# ADR-012: Single-Node Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: System must choose between single-node local deployment or distributed multi-node architecture based on academic research environment constraints and requirements.

## Decision

We will implement a **single-node architecture** optimized for local deployment on researcher personal or institutional computers:

```python
class SingleNodeArchitecture:
    def __init__(self):
        self.deployment_target = "local_researcher_environment"
        self.database_strategy = "embedded_databases"  # Neo4j + SQLite
        self.processing_model = "sequential_with_async"
        self.resource_constraints = "single_machine_optimization"
        self.user_model = "single_researcher_per_instance"
```

### **Core Design Principles**
1. **Local data processing**: All analysis occurs on researcher's machine
2. **Embedded databases**: Neo4j and SQLite run locally without server administration
3. **Simple deployment**: Single installation command with minimal dependencies
4. **Resource optimization**: Efficient use of typical academic hardware (8-32GB RAM, 4-8 cores)
5. **Offline capability**: Core functionality works without internet connectivity

## Rationale

### **Why Single-Node Architecture?**

**1. Academic Research Environment Reality**:
- **Individual researchers**: Primary users are PhD students, postdocs, faculty working independently
- **Personal computers**: Analysis performed on laptops/desktops, not server infrastructure
- **Institutional constraints**: Many institutions lack resources for distributed research infrastructure
- **Data sensitivity**: Academic research often involves sensitive data requiring local processing

**2. Research Workflow Patterns**:
- **Project-based**: Research projects are discrete, time-bounded efforts (months to years)
- **Dataset sizes**: Typical academic research involves 10-1000 documents, not millions
- **Iterative analysis**: Researchers repeatedly analyze same datasets with different approaches
- **Exploratory nature**: Research involves experimental methods requiring rapid iteration

**3. Academic Computing Constraints**:
- **Limited technical expertise**: Researchers are domain experts, not systems administrators
- **No DevOps support**: Most academic environments lack dedicated infrastructure teams
- **Budget limitations**: Academic budgets cannot support complex distributed infrastructure
- **Reproducibility requirements**: Other researchers must be able to replicate analysis locally

### **Why Not Distributed Architecture?**

**Distributed architectures would create incompatible barriers**:

**1. Infrastructure Requirements**:
- **Server administration**: Requires database server setup, monitoring, maintenance
- **Network configuration**: Requires understanding of distributed system networking
- **Security management**: Requires enterprise-level security expertise
- **Resource provisioning**: Requires understanding of distributed resource allocation

**2. Academic Environment Mismatch**:
- **Single-user focus**: Academic research is typically individual, not multi-tenant
- **Intermittent usage**: Research projects have periods of intensive use followed by dormancy
- **Data locality**: Researchers need direct access to their data and processing results
- **Reproducibility**: Other researchers must replicate analysis without complex infrastructure

**3. Cost and Complexity**:
- **Infrastructure costs**: Distributed systems require significant ongoing operational costs
- **Maintenance overhead**: Requires ongoing system administration and monitoring
- **Deployment complexity**: Complex setup procedures incompatible with academic workflows
- **Failure modes**: Distributed system failures require specialized expertise to diagnose

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Distributed Multi-Node Architecture**
**Rejected because**:
- **Infrastructure requirements**: Requires server administration expertise beyond typical research environments
- **Cost barriers**: Ongoing infrastructure costs incompatible with academic budgets
- **Deployment complexity**: Setup procedures too complex for individual researchers
- **Reproducibility issues**: Other researchers cannot easily replicate distributed infrastructure

### **2. Cloud-Based SaaS Architecture**
**Rejected because**:
- **Data sensitivity**: Academic research often involves confidential or proprietary data
- **Internet dependency**: Researchers need offline analysis capability
- **Cost concerns**: Per-use costs can become prohibitive for extensive academic research
- **Control limitations**: Researchers lose control over processing parameters and methods

### **3. Hybrid Local/Cloud Architecture**
**Rejected because**:
- **Complexity**: Creates two different deployment and configuration paths
- **Data synchronization**: Complex data management across local and cloud environments
- **Cost unpredictability**: Difficult to predict cloud costs for academic research budgets
- **Reproducibility**: Hybrid environments difficult to replicate by other researchers

### **4. Container-Based Distributed (Docker Swarm/Kubernetes)**
**Rejected because**:
- **Technical complexity**: Requires container orchestration expertise
- **Resource overhead**: Container orchestration adds significant resource requirements
- **Local deployment issues**: Complex local Kubernetes setup inappropriate for researchers
- **Maintenance burden**: Requires ongoing orchestration platform maintenance

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Simple deployment**: Single installation command gets researchers running
- **Local data control**: Researchers maintain complete control over their data
- **Offline capability**: Analysis can continue without internet connectivity
- **Reproducible environment**: Other researchers can easily replicate identical local setup
- **Cost-effective**: No ongoing infrastructure or cloud costs
- **Fast iteration**: No network latency or coordination overhead for analysis iterations

### **Negative**
- **Scalability limits**: Cannot handle enterprise-scale datasets (millions of documents)
- **Resource constraints**: Limited by single-machine memory and processing power
- **No multi-user support**: Cannot support multiple concurrent researchers
- **Limited parallelization**: Parallelization constrained to single-machine cores
- **Backup responsibility**: Researchers responsible for their own data backup

## Single-Node Architecture Implementation

### **Database Strategy**
```python
class LocalDatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self, data_directory: Path):
        # Embedded Neo4j - no server required
        self.neo4j = GraphDatabase.driver(
            f"bolt://localhost:7687",
            auth=("neo4j", "password"),
            encrypted=False  # Local deployment
        )
        
        # SQLite file database - no server required
        self.sqlite_path = data_directory / "kgas_metadata.db"
        self.sqlite = sqlite3.connect(str(self.sqlite_path))
```

### **Processing Model**
```python
class SingleNodeProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = None):
        # Use all available cores but respect memory constraints
        self.max_workers = max_workers or min(8, os.cpu_count())
        self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers)
    
    async def process_documents(self, documents: List[Path]) -> ProcessingResults:
        """Process documents using single-node async concurrency"""
        # Batch processing to manage memory usage
        results = []
        for batch in self._create_batches(documents, batch_size=10):
            batch_results = await self._process_batch(batch)
            results.extend(batch_results)
            
            # Memory management between batches
            self._cleanup_batch_resources()
            
        return ProcessingResults(results)
```

### **Resource Management**
```python
class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.available_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available
        self.available_cores = os.cpu_count()
        
    def optimize_for_hardware(self) -> ProcessingConfig:
        """Optimize processing parameters for available hardware"""
        return ProcessingConfig(
            batch_size=self._calculate_optimal_batch_size(),
            worker_threads=min(8, self.available_cores),
            memory_limit=int(self.available_memory * 0.8),  # Leave 20% for OS
            cache_size=self._calculate_cache_size()
        )
```

## Scalability Strategy

### **Current Limitations and Workarounds**
- **Memory limits**: Process documents in batches to manage memory usage
- **Processing time**: Use async processing and progress tracking for large datasets
- **Storage limits**: Implement data archival and cleanup strategies
- **CPU constraints**: Optimize algorithms for single-machine parallelization

### **Future Extension Points**
While maintaining single-node focus, architecture allows for:
- **Cloud processing backends**: Optional cloud processing for very large datasets
- **Cluster computing**: Optional integration with academic computing clusters
- **Batch job systems**: Integration with university computing resources

```python
# Future extension interface (not current implementation)
class ProcessingBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def submit_job(self, job_spec: Dict) -> str:
        pass

class LocalProcessingBackend(ProcessingBackend):
    """Current single-node implementation"""
    pass

class AzureProcessingBackend(ProcessingBackend):
    """Future cloud processing option"""
    pass
```

## Implementation Requirements

### **Local Deployment**
- **One-command setup**: `pip install kgas && kgas init`
- **Automatic database setup**: Embedded databases start automatically
- **Default configuration**: Sensible defaults for typical academic hardware
- **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of resource constraints

### **Resource Optimization**
- **Memory management**: Batch processing to avoid memory exhaustion
- **CPU utilization**: Efficient use of available cores without oversubscription

# ADR-013: MCP Protocol Integration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: System requires standardized tool interface protocol for exposing analysis capabilities to external clients and enabling tool composition workflows.

## Decision

We will integrate the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as the standard interface for exposing KGAS tools:

```python
# MCP integration pattern
from fastmcp import FastMCP

app = FastMCP("KGAS Analysis Tools")

@app.tool()
def extract_entities(
    text: str,
    entity_types: List[str] = ["PERSON", "ORG", "CONCEPT"]
) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    """Extract entities from text using SpaCy NER with academic research optimization."""
    service_manager = ServiceManager()
    tool = T23aSpacyNERUnified(service_manager=service_manager)
    
    result = tool.execute(ToolRequest(
        tool_id="T23A",
        operation="extract_entities",
        input_data={"text": text, "entity_types": entity_types}
    ))
    
    return result.data if result.status == "success" else {"error": result.error}
```

### **Core Integration Principles**
1. **Standard interface**: All KGAS tools exposed via MCP protocol
2. **Tool composition**: MCP enables chaining tools for complex workflows  
3. **External integration**: MCP allows integration with Claude, other AI systems
4. **Academic workflow support**: MCP tools designed for research use cases

## Rationale

### **Why MCP Protocol?**

**1. Academic Research Integration**:
- **AI-assisted research**: Researchers can use Claude/GPT to orchestrate complex analysis workflows
- **Tool discoverability**: MCP provides standardized tool discovery and documentation
- **Workflow automation**: AI systems can chain KGAS tools for multi-step research analysis
- **Research reproducibility**: MCP tool calls create auditable workflow records

**2. Standardized Tool Interface**:
- **Type safety**: MCP enforces type-safe tool interfaces with JSON Schema validation
- **Documentation**: Built-in tool documentation and help system
- **Error handling**: Standardized error reporting and recovery mechanisms
- **Versioning**: Tool interface versioning for backward compatibility

**3. External Integration Capabilities**:
- **Claude integration**: Direct integration with Claude for AI-assisted research
- **Tool ecosystem**: Compatibility with broader MCP tool ecosystem
- **Academic software**: Integration with other academic research tools using MCP
- **Workflow systems**: Integration with academic workflow management systems

### **Why Not Alternative Protocol Approaches?**

**REST API**:
- ❌ **More implementation overhead**: Requires full HTTP server implementation
- ❌ **Less type safety**: JSON REST APIs lack built-in type validation
- ❌ **Manual documentation**: Requires separate API documentation maintenance
- ❌ **Limited tool composition**: No built-in support for tool chaining workflows

**GraphQL**:
- ❌ **Complexity overhead**: GraphQL adds significant complexity for simple tool interfaces
- ❌ **Academic research mismatch**: GraphQL optimized for data queries, not tool execution
- ❌ **Limited AI integration**: No specific support for AI tool orchestration
- ❌ **Learning curve**: Requires GraphQL expertise for researchers and developers

**Python API Only**:
- ❌ **Language limitation**: Restricts integration to Python-only environments
- ❌ **No external access**: Cannot be accessed by external AI systems or tools
- ❌ **Limited composition**: No standardized way to chain tools across different systems
- ❌ **Academic workflow isolation**: Cannot integrate with broader academic tool ecosystem

**Custom Protocol**:
- ❌ **Implementation burden**: Requires designing, implementing, and maintaining custom protocol
- ❌ **No ecosystem**: Lacks existing tool ecosystem and client implementations
- ❌ **Documentation overhead**: Requires custom documentation and client libraries
- ❌ **Integration barriers**: Other systems would need custom integration code

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Pure REST API Architecture**
```python
# Rejected approach
@app.route('/api/v1/extract_entities', methods=['POST'])
def extract_entities_rest():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Process and return JSON response
```

**Rejected because**:
- **More boilerplate**: Requires manual request parsing, validation, error handling
- **Less type safety**: Manual JSON schema validation and type checking
- **Documentation overhead**: Requires separate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Limited AI integration**: No built-in support for AI tool orchestration

### **2. Direct Python API Only**
```python
# Rejected approach - no external interface
class KGASTools:
    def extract_entities(self, text: str) -> List[Entity]:
        # Direct Python API only
```

**Rejected because**:
- **No external access**: Cannot be used by Claude, other AI systems, or external tools
- **Limited workflow automation**: No way to chain tools from external orchestrators
- **Academic isolation**: Cannot integrate with broader academic research tool ecosystem
- **Reproducibility limitations**: Workflow orchestration must be done manually in Python

### **3. GraphQL Interface**
```python
# Rejected approach
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def extract_entities(self, text: str) -> List[EntityType]:
        # GraphQL implementation
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Complexity mismatch**: GraphQL designed for complex data querying, not tool execution
- **Academic workflow mismatch**: Research workflows are procedural, not query-based
- **Implementation overhead**: Requires GraphQL server setup and schema management
- **Limited tool composition**: No built-in support for sequential tool execution

### **4. Message Queue Integration (Celery/RQ)**
```python
# Rejected approach
@celery.task
def extract_entities_task(text: str) -> str:
    # Async task execution
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Infrastructure requirements**: Requires message broker setup (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- **Complexity overhead**: Async task management adds complexity inappropriate for academic use
- **Single-node mismatch**: Message queues designed for distributed systems
- **Academic workflow mismatch**: Research workflows are typically synchronous and interactive

## MCP Integration Implementation

### **Tool Wrapper Pattern**
```python
class MCPToolWrapper:
    """Wrapper for exposing KGAS tools via MCP"""
    
    def __init__(self, tool_class: Type[BaseTool]):
        self.tool_class = tool_class
        self.service_manager = ServiceManager()
    
    def create_mcp_tool(self) -> Callable:
        """Create MCP tool function from KGAS tool"""
        def mcp_tool_function(**kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            tool = self.tool_class(service_manager=self.service_manager)
            request = ToolRequest(
                tool_id=tool.tool_id,
                operation="execute",
                input_data=kwargs
            )
            result = tool.execute(request)
            
            if result.status == "success":
                return result.data
            else:
                return {"error": result.error, "error_code": result.error_code}
        
        return mcp_tool_function
```

### **Academic Research Tool Definitions**
```python
# Document processing tools
@app.tool()
def load_pdf_document(file_path: str, extract_metadata: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Load and extract text from PDF document with academic metadata."""
    
@app.tool()
def extract_entities_academic(
    text: str, 
    entity_types: List[str] = ["PERSON", "ORG", "CONCEPT", "THEORY"],
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.8
) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    """Extract academic entities with confidence scores for research analysis."""

    output_format: str = "academic_report"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Perform cross-modal analysis (graph/table/vector) with academic reporting."""
```

### **Research Workflow Composition**
```python
# Example: AI-orchestrated academic workflow
def research_analysis_workflow(document_paths: List[str]) -> str:
    """Example workflow that AI can orchestrate using MCP tools"""
    
    # Step 1: Load documents
    documents = []
    for path in document_paths:
        doc_result = load_pdf_document(file_path=path, extract_metadata=True)
        documents.append(doc_result)
    
    # Step 2: Extract entities from all documents
    all_entities = []
    for doc in documents:
        entities = extract_entities_academic(
            text=doc["content"],
            entity_types=["PERSON", "ORG", "CONCEPT", "THEORY"],
            confidence_threshold=0.8
        )
        all_entities.extend(entities["entities"])
    
    # Step 3: Build integrated knowledge graph
    graph = build_knowledge_graph(
        entities=all_entities,
        relationships=[],  # Would be extracted in real workflow
        theory_schema="stakeholder_theory"
    )
    
    # Step 4: Perform analysis
    analysis_result = analyze_cross_modal(
        graph_data=graph,
        analysis_type="centrality",
        output_format="academic_report"
    )
    
    return analysis_result["report"]
```

## Academic Research Benefits

### **AI-Assisted Research Workflows**
Researchers can use Claude to orchestrate complex analysis:
```
Researcher: "Analyze these 20 papers on stakeholder theory. Extract all entities, identify key relationships, and generate a centrality analysis showing the most influential concepts."

Claude: I'll orchestrate a multi-step analysis using KGAS tools:
1. Load all 20 PDF documents with metadata extraction
2. Extract academic entities (PERSON, ORG, CONCEPT, THEORY) 
3. Build an integrated knowledge graph
4. Perform centrality analysis
5. Generate academic report with proper citations

[Claude executes MCP tool sequence automatically]
```

### **Reproducible Research Workflows**
MCP tool calls create auditable workflow records:
```json

    {"tool": "build_knowledge_graph", "params": {"theory_schema": "stakeholder_theory"}}
  ],
  "results": {...}
}
```

# ADR-014: Error Handling Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: System requires consistent error handling approach that aligns with academic research requirements for transparency, debuggability, and reliability.

## Decision

We will implement a **fail-fast error handling strategy** with comprehensive error context and recovery guidance:

```python
class AcademicErrorHandler:
    """Error handling optimized for academic research transparency"""
    
    def handle_operation_error(self, operation: str, error: Exception, context: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": self._classify_error(error),
            "error_message": str(error),
            "operation": operation,
            "context": context,
            "recovery_guidance": self._generate_recovery_guidance(error, operation),
            "debug_info": self._extract_debug_info(error),
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "stack_trace": traceback.format_exc() if self.debug_mode else None
        }
```

### **Core Error Handling Principles**
1. **Fail-fast**: Errors cause immediate, clear failures rather than silent degradation
2. **Complete context**: All error information preserved for research debugging
3. **Recovery guidance**: Specific instructions for researchers to resolve issues  
4. **Transparency**: No error masking or information hiding
5. **Academic workflow preservation**: Error handling supports research workflow recovery

## Rationale

### **Why Fail-Fast Strategy?**

**1. Academic Research Requirements**:
- **Data integrity**: Research cannot proceed with corrupted or uncertain data
- **Reproducibility**: Silent errors make research results non-reproducible
- **Debugging necessity**: Researchers need complete error information to resolve issues
- **Methodological rigor**: Academic standards require transparent error acknowledgment

**2. Research Workflow Characteristics**:
- **Iterative development**: Researchers experiment with different approaches, need clear error feedback
- **Long-running analyses**: Multi-hour processing cannot fail silently and waste research time
- **Data sensitivity**: Academic data often irreplaceable, cannot risk silent corruption
- **Individual operation**: Single researcher can investigate and resolve errors immediately

**3. Academic vs. Enterprise Error Handling**:

| Aspect | Academic Research | Enterprise Production |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Error tolerance** | Zero tolerance - research integrity critical | Some tolerance - business continuity important |
| **Silent failures** | Unacceptable - corrupts research validity | Sometimes acceptable - graceful degradation |
| **Debug information** | Essential - researchers must understand failures | Limited - security and complexity concerns |
| **Recovery approach** | Manual with guidance - researcher investigates | Automated - system attempts self-recovery |
| **Error transparency** | Complete - academic rigor demands full disclosure | Filtered - user-friendly error messages |

### **Why Not Graceful Degradation?**

**Graceful degradation would undermine academic research**:

**1. Research Integrity Issues**:
- **Silent data loss**: Partial processing results appear complete but miss critical information
- **Confidence corruption**: System continues with degraded confidence but doesn't clearly indicate impact  
- **Reproducibility failure**: Different error conditions produce different results unpredictably
- **Citation problems**: Incomplete processing creates inaccurate source attribution

**2. Academic Workflow Problems**:
- **Debugging difficulty**: Masked errors make it impossible to identify and fix root causes
- **Wasted research time**: Researchers continue analysis on corrupted data for hours/days
- **Publication risks**: Research results based on silently failed processing cannot be trusted
- **Methodology questions**: Reviewers cannot validate research with hidden processing failures

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Graceful Degradation Strategy**
```python
# Rejected approach
def graceful_degradation_handler(error, context):
    logger.warning(f"Operation failed: {error}")
    return {
        "status": "partial_success",
        "data": incomplete_results,
        "warnings": ["Some processing failed"]
    }
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Research integrity**: Partial results without clear error indication corrupt research validity
- **Silent failure**: Researchers may not notice processing problems until much later
- **Reproducibility issues**: Different failure modes produce different "partial" results
- **Academic standards**: Research requires acknowledging and addressing all processing issues

### **2. Exception Swallowing (Silent Failure)**
```python
# Rejected approach - common anti-pattern found in existing code
try:
    critical_operation()
except Exception as e:
    logger.info(f"WARNING: Operation failed: {e}")
    logger.info("Continuing without result - some features may be limited")
    return None  # Silent failure
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Data corruption risk**: Continuing with None/partial data corrupts downstream analysis
- **Debugging impossibility**: Silent failures make error diagnosis extremely difficult
- **Academic integrity violation**: Research cannot proceed with unknown processing failures
- **Time waste**: Researchers may spend hours analyzing results from failed processing

### **3. User-Friendly Error Messages Only**
```python
# Rejected approach
def user_friendly_errors(error):
    return {
        "status": "error",
        "message": "Something went wrong. Please try again."
    }
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Insufficient debugging information**: Researchers need technical details to resolve issues
- **Academic transparency**: Research requires complete error disclosure
- **Problem resolution**: Generic messages don't provide guidance for fixing issues
- **Research workflow**: Academics can handle technical error information

### **4. Retry-Based Error Recovery**
```python
# Rejected approach
def retry_handler(operation, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return operation()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Academic workflow mismatch**: Research errors usually require human investigation, not retries
- **Resource waste**: Academic hardware may not handle multiple retry attempts efficiently
- **Error masking**: Successful retries after failures hide potential systematic issues
- **Time sensitivity**: Long retry sequences inappropriate for interactive research workflows

## Fail-Fast Implementation

### **Error Classification System**
```python
class ErrorType(Enum):
    VALIDATION_ERROR = "validation_error"      # Input validation failures
    PROCESSING_ERROR = "processing_error"      # Core operation failures  
    RESOURCE_ERROR = "resource_error"          # Memory/disk/CPU constraints
    INTEGRATION_ERROR = "integration_error"    # Service/database failures
    CONFIGURATION_ERROR = "configuration_error" # Setup/config issues
    DATA_ERROR = "data_error"                  # Input data problems

class AcademicErrorResponse:
    def __init__(self, error: Exception, operation: str, context: Dict):
        self.error_type = self._classify_error(error)
        self.error_message = str(error)
        self.operation = operation
        self.context = self._sanitize_context(context)
        self.recovery_guidance = self._generate_recovery_guidance()
        self.debug_info = self._extract_debug_info(error)
        self.timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
```

### **Recovery Guidance System**
```python
class RecoveryGuidanceGenerator:
    """Generate specific recovery instructions for researchers"""
    
    def generate_guidance(self, error_type: ErrorType, operation: str, context: Dict) -> List[str]:
        guidance_map = {
            ErrorType.VALIDATION_ERROR: [
                "Check input data format matches expected schema",
                "Verify required fields are present and correctly typed",
                "Review tool documentation for input requirements"
            ],
            ErrorType.PROCESSING_ERROR: [
                "Check system resources (memory, disk space)",
                "Verify input data is not corrupted",
                "Review processing logs for specific failure points",
                "Consider reducing batch size for large datasets"
            ],
            ErrorType.RESOURCE_ERROR: [
                "Check available memory and disk space",
                "Reduce processing batch size",
                "Close other applications to free resources",
                "Consider processing documents in smaller groups"
            ],
            ErrorType.INTEGRATION_ERROR: [
                "Verify database services are running (Neo4j)",
                "Check database connectivity and credentials",
                "Review service logs for connection issues",
                "Restart database services if necessary"
            ]
        }
        
        base_guidance = guidance_map.get(error_type, ["Contact system administrator"])
        return base_guidance + self._operation_specific_guidance(operation, context)
```

class AcademicToolBase:
    """Base class implementing fail-fast error handling for research tools"""
    
    def execute(self, request: ToolRequest) -> ToolResult:
        try:

                context={"processing_stage": e.processing_stage}
            )
            
        except Exception as e:
            # Unexpected errors - maximum information preservation
            return self._create_error_result(
                error_type=ErrorType.PROCESSING_ERROR,
                error=e,

                }
            )
    
    def _create_error_result(
        self, 
        error_type: ErrorType, 
        error: Exception,

        context: Dict
    ) -> ToolResult:
        """Create comprehensive error result for academic research"""
        return ToolResult(

            error_message=str(error),
            metadata={

                "system_state": self._capture_system_state()
            }
        )
```

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Research integrity**: Immediate error detection prevents corrupted research results
- **Debugging capability**: Complete error information enables rapid problem resolution
- **Transparency**: Researchers have complete visibility into processing failures
- **Academic standards**: Error handling meets rigorous academic research requirements
- **Time efficiency**: Clear errors save researcher time compared to debugging silent failures
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent error handling ensures reproducible research workflows

### **Negative**
- **Less fault tolerance**: System stops on errors that enterprise systems might handle gracefully
- **Researcher burden**: Researchers must understand and resolve technical errors
- **Workflow interruption**: Research workflows stop completely on errors
- **Technical exposure**: Researchers see technical error details rather than user-friendly messages

## Academic Research Benefits

### **Research Workflow Preservation**
```python
# Example: Research workflow with proper error handling
def research_analysis_workflow(documents: List[str]) -> ResearchResults:
    try:
        # Each step fails fast with complete error information
        loaded_docs = load_documents(documents)  # Fails immediately if PDF corrupted
        entities = extract_entities(loaded_docs)  # Fails immediately if NLP model unavailable
        graph = build_graph(entities)           # Fails immediately if Neo4j unavailable
        analysis = analyze_graph(graph)         # Fails immediately if insufficient memory
        
        return ResearchResults(analysis)
        
    except ValidationError as e:
        # Researcher gets complete error context and specific recovery guidance
        print(f"Input validation failed: {e}")
        print(f"Recovery guidance: {e.recovery_guidance}")
        raise  # Research cannot proceed with invalid inputs
        
    except ProcessingError as e:
        # Researcher understands exactly what failed and how to fix it
        print(f"Processing failed at stage: {e.processing_stage}")
        print(f"Error details: {e.debug_info}")
        print(f"Recovery guidance: {e.recovery_guidance}")
        raise  # Research cannot proceed with failed processing
```

### **Academic Integrity Protection**
- **No silent data loss**: All processing failures immediately apparent
- **Complete audit trail**: All errors logged with full context for research validation
- **Reproducibility assurance**: Error conditions produce consistent, documented failures
- **Method validation**: Reviewers can verify that error handling meets research standards

### **Research Efficiency**
- **Immediate feedback**: Researchers know immediately when something goes wrong
- **Specific guidance**: Recovery instructions help researchers resolve issues quickly
- **Complete information**: Debug information enables efficient problem resolution
- **Workflow clarity**: Clear success/failure states for each research step

## Implementation Requirements

### **Error Response Standardization**
All system components must return standardized error responses:
```python
{
    "status": "error",
    "error_code": "validation_error",
    "error_message": "Entity type 'INVALID_TYPE' not supported",
    "operation": "extract_entities",
    "context": {"input_entity_types": ["PERSON", "INVALID_TYPE"]},
    "recovery_guidance": [
        "Use supported entity types: PERSON, ORG, CONCEPT, THEORY",
        "Check tool documentation for complete entity type list",
        "Verify entity type spelling and capitalization"
    ],
    "debug_info": {
        "available_entity_types": ["PERSON", "ORG", "CONCEPT", "THEORY"],
        "spacy_model": "en_core_web_sm",
        "model_version": "3.4.0"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-07-23T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### **Logging Integration**
All errors must integrate with structured logging:
```python
logger.error(
    "Tool execution failed",
    extra={
        "tool_id": self.tool_id,
        "operation": operation,
        "error_type": error_type.value,
        "error_message": str(error),
        "context": context,
        "recovery_guidance": recovery_guidance
    }
)
```

### **Service Integration**
Error handling must integrate with core services:
- **Provenance service**: Log all errors for complete research audit trail
- **Quality service**: Mark failed operations with zero confidence
- **Workflow service**: Enable workflow recovery from error checkpoints

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] All system components implement fail-fast error handling
- [ ] Error responses include complete context and recovery guidance
- [ ] No silent failures or error masking anywhere in system
- [ ] Error information sufficient for researchers to resolve issues
- [ ] Error handling preserves research workflow integrity
- [ ] Logging captures all error information for research audit trails
- [ ] Error responses are consistent across all system components

## Related ADRs

- **ADR-011**: Academic Research Focus (error handling optimized for research requirements)
- **ADR-008**: Core Service Architecture (services implement consistent error handling)
- **ADR-010**: Quality System Design (error handling integrates with confidence tracking)

# ADR-015: Cross-Modal Orchestration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: Academic research requires flexible analysis across different data representations (graph, table, vector) with seamless conversion and source traceability.

## Decision

We will implement **cross-modal orchestration** enabling fluid movement between three analysis modes:

1. **Graph Analysis**: Relationships, centrality, communities, paths
2. **Table Analysis**: Statistical analysis, aggregations, correlations  
3. **Vector Analysis**: Similarity search, clustering, embeddings

```python
class CrossModalOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrate analysis across graph, table, and vector representations"""
    
    def __init__(self, service_manager: ServiceManager):
        self.services = service_manager
        self.neo4j = service_manager.neo4j_manager
        self.analytics = service_manager.analytics_service
    
    def convert_representation(
        self, 
        data: Any, 
        from_mode: AnalysisMode, 
        to_mode: AnalysisMode,
        preserve_provenance: bool = True
    ) -> CrossModalResult:
        """Convert data between analysis modes with provenance preservation"""
        
        converter = self._get_converter(from_mode, to_mode)
        converted_data = converter.convert(data)
        
        if preserve_provenance:
            self._link_provenance(data, converted_data, from_mode, to_mode)
        
        return CrossModalResult(
            data=converted_data,
            source_mode=from_mode,
            target_mode=to_mode,
            conversion_metadata=converter.get_metadata()
        )
```

### **Core Cross-Modal Principles**
1. **Semantic preservation**: Meaning preserved across format conversions
2. **Source traceability**: All converted data linked to original sources
3. **Analysis flexibility**: Researchers can switch modes based on research questions
4. **Quality tracking**: Confidence scores maintained through conversions

## Rationale

### **Why Cross-Modal Analysis?**

**1. Academic Research Diversity**:
Different research questions require different analytical approaches:

- **"Who are the most influential researchers?"** → Graph analysis (centrality)
- **"What theories correlate with publication impact?"** → Table analysis (correlation)
- **"Which papers are most similar to this one?"** → Vector analysis (similarity)
- **"How do research communities form over time?"** → Graph analysis (community detection)

**2. Research Method Integration**:
Academic research often requires combining multiple analytical approaches:
- **Exploratory phase**: Vector similarity to find related work
- **Network analysis**: Graph analysis to understand relationships
- **Statistical validation**: Table analysis for hypothesis testing
- **Result synthesis**: Cross-modal integration for comprehensive understanding

**3. Theory-Aware Processing**:
Social science theories often specify particular analytical approaches:
- **Stakeholder Theory**: Requires graph analysis (influence networks)
- **Diffusion of Innovations**: Requires both graph (adoption networks) and table (adoption rates)
- **Social Identity Theory**: Requires vector analysis (group similarity) and graph (group boundaries)

### **Why Not Single-Mode Analysis?**

**Graph-Only Analysis**:
- ❌ **Statistical limitations**: Poor support for correlations, regression analysis
- ❌ **Quantitative analysis**: Difficulty with statistical hypothesis testing
- ❌ **Temporal analysis**: Limited support for time-series analysis
- ❌ **Similarity search**: No efficient content-based similarity queries

**Table-Only Analysis**:
- ❌ **Relationship modeling**: Cannot efficiently model complex relationship networks
- ❌ **Path analysis**: No support for network path analysis
- ❌ **Community detection**: Cannot identify clusters in relationship networks
- ❌ **Influence analysis**: Limited support for influence propagation models

**Vector-Only Analysis**:
- ❌ **Explicit relationships**: Cannot model explicit relationship types
- ❌ **Network properties**: No access to network topology metrics
- ❌ **Statistical analysis**: Limited support for traditional statistical methods
- ❌ **Categorical analysis**: Difficulty with discrete categorical relationships

## Cross-Modal Architecture

### **Analysis Mode Definitions**

## Academic Research Applications

### **Multi-Modal Research Workflow**
```python
class AcademicResearchWorkflow:
    """Example academic research workflow using cross-modal analysis"""
    
    def analyze_research_community(self, papers: List[Document]) -> ResearchAnalysis:
        """Multi-modal analysis of research community"""

            salience_scores=salience_scores,
            stakeholder_groups=stakeholder_clusters
        )
```

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Single Analysis Mode Architecture**
**Rejected because**:
- **Limited research flexibility**: Cannot support diverse academic research approaches
- **Method constraints**: Researchers forced to use inappropriate analytical methods
- **Integration impossibility**: Cannot combine different analytical perspectives
- **Theory limitations**: Many theories require multiple analytical approaches

### **2. Manual Format Conversion**
```python
# Rejected approach
def manual_conversion_workflow():
    # Researcher manually exports and imports between formats
    graph_results = run_graph_analysis()
    export_to_csv(graph_results, "graph_data.csv")
    
    table_data = pd.read_csv("graph_data.csv")
    stats_results = run_statistical_analysis(table_data)
    # Loses provenance, error-prone, inefficient
```

**Rejected because**:
- **Provenance loss**: Manual conversion loses source traceability
- **Error-prone**: Manual steps introduce data corruption risk
- **Inefficient**: Significant researcher time spent on format conversion
- **Quality degradation**: Conversion quality depends on researcher expertise

### **3. Separate Analysis Systems**
**Rejected because**:
- **Integration complexity**: Multiple systems with different data formats
- **Consistency issues**: Different systems may produce conflicting results
- **Maintenance overhead**: Multiple systems to maintain and update
- **User complexity**: Researchers must learn multiple different interfaces

### **4. Format-Agnostic Single Interface**
**Rejected because**:
- **Performance penalties**: Generic interface cannot optimize for specific analysis types
- **Feature limitations**: Cannot expose mode-specific advanced features
- **Analysis constraints**: Forces lowest-common-denominator analytical capabilities
- **Academic research mismatch**: Research requires mode-specific optimizations

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Research flexibility**: Researchers can use optimal analysis mode for each research question
- **Method integration**: Multiple analytical approaches can be combined seamlessly
- **Source traceability**: All conversions maintain links to original sources
- **Quality preservation**: Confidence scores and quality metrics maintained across modes
- **Theory support**: Academic theories can specify appropriate analysis modes
- **Workflow efficiency**: Automatic conversion eliminates manual format translation

### **Negative**
- **System complexity**: Cross-modal conversion adds significant implementation complexity
- **Performance overhead**: Format conversions may introduce processing delays
- **Quality concerns**: Conversion quality depends on semantic mapping accuracy
- **Learning curve**: Researchers must understand when to use different analysis modes

## Implementation Requirements

### **Semantic Preservation**
All cross-modal conversions must preserve semantic meaning:
- **Entity identity**: Same entities maintain consistent identity across modes
- **Relationship semantics**: Relationship meaning preserved in appropriate target format
- **Confidence propagation**: Quality scores maintained through conversions
- **Source attribution**: All converted data linked to original sources

### **Provenance Integration**
Cross-modal operations must integrate with provenance service:
```python
def log_cross_modal_conversion(
    source_data: Any,
    target_data: Any,
    from_mode: AnalysisMode,
    to_mode: AnalysisMode,
    conversion_metadata: Dict
):
    """Log cross-modal conversion for research audit trail"""
    provenance_service.log_operation(
        operation="cross_modal_conversion",
        inputs={
            "source_mode": from_mode.value,
            "source_data_id": get_data_id(source_data)
        },
        outputs={
            "target_mode": to_mode.value,
            "target_data_id": get_data_id(target_data)
        },
        metadata=conversion_metadata
    )
```

### **Quality Tracking**
Quality service must track confidence through conversions:
- **Conversion degradation**: Model quality loss in format conversion
- **Aggregation confidence**: Handle confidence in data aggregation operations
- **Mode-specific quality**: Different quality metrics for different analysis modes

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Data can be converted between all analysis mode combinations
- [ ] Semantic meaning preserved across all conversions
- [ ] Source provenance maintained through conversion chains
- [ ] Quality/confidence scores appropriately propagated
- [ ] Academic research workflows supported across all modes
- [ ] Theory-aware processing works across analysis modes
- [ ] Performance acceptable for typical academic research datasets

# ADR-016: Bayesian Uncertainty Aggregation System

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Context**: KGAS needs to handle multiple sources reporting the same claim with potentially different confidence levels. The current degradation-only model (ADR-010) cannot account for evidence accumulation from multiple sources.

## Decision

We will implement a **Bayesian uncertainty aggregation system** that uses LLM intelligence to estimate parameters for proper Bayesian updating when multiple sources report the same claim.

### Core Architecture

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class BayesianAnalysisOutput(BaseModel):
    prior_H: float  # P(H) - prior probability
    joint_likelihood_given_H: float  # P(E₁,E₂,...,Eₙ|H)
    joint_likelihood_given_not_H: float  # P(E₁,E₂,...,Eₙ|¬H)
    reasoning: str  # Explanation of the analysis

class BayesianAggregationService:
    def aggregate_multiple_sources(
        self, 
        claims: List[ExtractedClaim],
        theory_context: TheorySchema
    ) -> AggregatedClaim:
        # 1. LLM analyzes dependencies and estimates parameters
        analysis = self.llm.perform_bayesian_analysis(
            claims=claims,
            prompt=self._create_bayesian_prompt(claims, theory_context),
            response_format=BayesianAnalysisOutput
        )
        
        # 2. Programmatic Bayesian update
        posterior = self._bayesian_update(analysis)
        
        # 3. Meta-uncertainty adjustment
        final_confidence = self._adjust_for_meta_uncertainty(
            posterior, analysis.reasoning
        )
        
        return AggregatedClaim(
            claim=claims[0].normalize(),
            confidence=final_confidence,
            method="bayesian_aggregation",
            source_count=len(claims),
            audit_trail=self._create_audit_trail(analysis, posterior)
        )
```

## Rationale

### Why Bayesian Aggregation?

**1. Mathematical Soundness**: Bayesian updating provides a principled framework for combining evidence while accounting for dependencies between sources.

**2. LLM Intelligence Leverage**: LLMs can assess complex factors like:
- Source independence (citation networks, temporal dependencies)
- Domain-specific evidence patterns
- Theory requirements (actual influence vs. perception)

**3. Evidence Accumulation**: Unlike degradation-only, this allows confidence to increase when multiple independent sources confirm a claim.

**4. Dependency Handling**: Proper joint likelihood estimation prevents overconfidence from dependent sources.

### Why LLM Parameter Estimation?

**1. Context-Aware Assessment**: LLMs can consider:
- Citation relationships between sources
- Temporal cascade effects (later sources influenced by earlier)
- Domain conventions (courtesy citations, grant strategies)
- Theory-specific requirements

**2. Flexible Intelligence**: No need for rigid rules about specific dependency types - LLM adapts to each situation.

**3. Transparent Reasoning**: LLM provides explanation for its parameter estimates, enabling audit and validation.

## Implementation Details

### Bayesian Update Formula

```python
def bayesian_update(analysis: BayesianAnalysisOutput) -> float:
    """Apply Bayes' theorem with LLM-estimated parameters"""
    numerator = analysis.prior_H * analysis.joint_likelihood_given_H
    denominator = (
        (analysis.prior_H * analysis.joint_likelihood_given_H) + 
        ((1 - analysis.prior_H) * analysis.joint_likelihood_given_not_H)
    )
    
    posterior = numerator / denominator
    return posterior
```

### LLM Prompt Strategy

```python
prompt = """You are an expert Bayesian analyst. Multiple sources report:
[source details with confidence levels]

Apply Bayesian reasoning to determine the posterior probability of this claim.

Remember that Bayesian updating requires:
- Prior probability P(H)
- Joint likelihood P(E₁,E₂,...,Eₙ|H) - probability of observing ALL evidence if H is true
- Joint likelihood P(E₁,E₂,...,Eₙ|¬H) - probability of observing ALL evidence if H is false

If sources are not independent, the joint likelihood is NOT simply the product 
of individual likelihoods. You must consider how evidence pieces relate.

Estimate these probabilities and explain your reasoning."""
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

**1. Claim Matching**: System first identifies claims about the same relationship
**2. Dependency Analysis**: LLM analyzes source relationships
**3. Bayesian Aggregation**: Apply proper updating with dependencies
**4. Theory Integration**: Consider theory requirements in prior estimation
**5. Audit Trail**: Complete record of aggregation process

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Simple Averaging
**Rejected**: Ignores evidence strength differences and dependencies

### 2. Maximum Confidence
**Rejected**: Discards valuable corroborating evidence

### 3. Hardcoded Dependency Rules
**Rejected**: Cannot handle complex, context-specific dependencies

### 4. Full Bayesian Network
**Rejected**: Too complex for dynamic claim aggregation

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Mathematically Sound**: Proper handling of dependent evidence
- **Context-Aware**: Adapts to domain and theory requirements
- **Evidence Accumulation**: Multiple sources can strengthen claims
- **Audit Trail**: Transparent reasoning for all aggregations
- **Flexible**: Handles various dependency types without rigid rules

### Negative
- **Computational Cost**: LLM analysis for each multi-source claim
- **Consistency**: LLM estimates may vary between runs
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple degradation
- **Calibration Need**: Requires validation against human judgments

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

```python
class OptimizedBayesianAggregation:
    def should_use_full_analysis(self, claims: List[Claim]) -> bool:
        # Use full Bayesian analysis for complex cases
        if len(claims) > 3 or self._has_complex_dependencies(claims):
            return True
        # Use simple aggregation for straightforward cases
        return False
    
    def aggregate(self, claims: List[Claim]) -> AggregatedClaim:
        if self.should_use_full_analysis(claims):
            return self._full_bayesian_analysis(claims)
        else:
            return self._simple_aggregation(claims)
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache Bayesian analyses by claim fingerprint
- Reuse analyses for identical claim sets
- Expire cache based on theory context changes

## Validation and Calibration

### Validation Methods
1. **Mechanical Turk Studies**: Compare to human expert aggregations
2. **Consistency Testing**: Ensure similar cases get similar treatment
3. **Perturbation Analysis**: Test robustness to parameter variations
4. **Theory Alignment**: Verify aggregations align with theory requirements

### Calibration Process
```python
class CalibrationService:
    def calibrate_priors(self, domain: str, validation_data: List[ValidationCase]):
        # Learn domain-specific priors from validated cases
        # Store in prior library for future use
        
    def validate_aggregation(self, aggregated: AggregatedClaim, expert_judgment: float):
        # Track accuracy of Bayesian aggregations
        # Adjust meta-uncertainty factors based on performance
```

## Related Systems

### Integration Points
- **ADR-010**: Quality System (provides base confidences)
- **ADR-004**: Confidence Score Ontology (defines confidence semantics)
- **Theory Repository**: Provides context for prior estimation
- **Audit Service**: Records complete aggregation process

### Configuration
```yaml
uncertainty:
  aggregation:
    method: "bayesian_llm"
    llm_model: "gpt-4"
    cache_enabled: true
    optimization:
      simple_threshold: 3  # Use simple method for ≤3 sources
      cache_ttl: 3600     # Cache for 1 hour
    calibration:
      mechanical_turk_enabled: true
      domain_priors:
        academic_influence: 0.15
        cross_field_influence: 0.05
```

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Implement alongside existing degradation system
2. **Phase 2**: A/B test on subset of multi-source claims  
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual rollout based on validation results
4. **Phase 4**: Full deployment with monitoring

## Future Enhancements

1. **Domain-Specific Prior Libraries**: Pre-computed priors for common domains
2. **Adaptive Meta-Uncertainty**: Learn uncertainty in LLM estimates
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple LLMs for robust parameter estimation
4. **Real-time Calibration**: Continuous improvement from user feedback

This ADR establishes Bayesian aggregation as the primary method for handling multiple sources reporting the same claim, replacing simple degradation with mathematically sound evidence accumulation.

# ADR-017: Intelligence Community Analytical Techniques Integration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Decision Makers**: KGAS Development Team  

## Context

Through extensive research and stress testing, we have identified that analytical techniques developed by the Intelligence Community (IC) over 50+ years can significantly enhance academic research capabilities. These techniques, documented in ICD-203, ICD-206, CIA handbooks, and research by Richards J. Heuer Jr., address fundamental analytical challenges that are equally present in academic research.

Key challenges in academic research that IC techniques address:
- Information overload and diminishing returns
- Multiple competing theories requiring systematic comparison
- Cognitive biases affecting research conclusions
- Overconfidence in predictions and timelines
- Difficulty knowing when to stop collecting information

## Decision

We will integrate five core IC analytical techniques into KGAS Phase 2 implementation:

1. **Information Value Assessment** (Heuer's 4 Types)
   - Categorize information as: Diagnostic, Consistent, Anomalous, or Irrelevant
   - Prioritize high-value information that distinguishes between hypotheses
   - Implement in document processing pipeline

2. **Collection Stopping Rules**
   - Diminishing returns detection
   - Confidence plateau identification
   - Cost-benefit thresholds
   - Implement in collection orchestration

3. **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)**
   - Systematic theory comparison focusing on disconfirmation
   - Evidence diagnosticity calculation
   - Bayesian probability updates
   - Implement as new tool T91

4. **Calibration System**
   - Track confidence accuracy over time
   - Detect systematic over/underconfidence
   - Apply personalized corrections
   - Enhance Quality Service

5. **Mental Model Auditing** (Future - Phase 3)
   - Detect cognitive biases in reasoning
   - Distinguish justified expertise from bias
   - Generate debiasing strategies
   - Requires advanced LLM capabilities

## Rationale

### Why These Techniques Work for Academia

1. **Proven Track Record**: 50+ years of refinement in high-stakes analysis
2. **Address Universal Problems**: Information overload, bias, and uncertainty affect all analysis
3. **LLM Advantages**: Modern LLMs can implement these techniques better than humans:
   - Access to broader literature
   - Consistent application of methods
   - Transparent reasoning
   - No personal biases

### Stress Test Results

Comprehensive stress testing in `/home/brian/projects/Digimons/uncertainty_stress_test/` demonstrated:
- All features handle academic-scale data efficiently (100-100,000 items/sec)
- Realistic academic scenarios work well (literature reviews, theory debates)
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- Clear integration points with KGAS architecture

### Key Design Principles

1. **LLM as Intelligent Analyst**: The system leverages frontier LLMs to act as intelligent, flexible analysts rather than rule-following automata
2. **Adaptive Intelligence Over Hard-Coded Rules**: LLMs dynamically adapt IC techniques to context rather than following rigid implementations
3. **Human-Like Judgment**: LLMs exercise judgment about when and how to apply techniques, similar to expert human analysts
4. **Transparent Reasoning**: Always explain analytical decisions and adaptations
5. **Graceful Degradation**: When full analysis isn't feasible, LLMs intelligently simplify like humans would
6. **Academic Context Awareness**: LLMs understand and adapt to academic vs intelligence contexts

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Research Quality**: Systematic bias reduction and better theory comparison
2. **Efficiency**: Know when to stop collecting, prioritize high-value sources
3. **Confidence Accuracy**: Better research planning and timeline estimation
4. **Novel Capability**: ACH brings intelligence-grade analysis to academia
5. **Scalability**: LLMs can apply these techniques consistently at scale

### Negative

1. **Learning Curve**: Researchers need to understand new analytical methods
2. **Context Window Management**: Large hypothesis sets require chunking strategies
3. **Trust Building**: Need transparency to build user confidence in IC methods
4. **Cultural Shift**: Academic culture may resist intelligence-derived methods

### Mitigations

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with simple features (stopping rules), build up
2. **Education**: Clear documentation and examples from academic contexts
3. **Transparency**: Always show reasoning for analytical judgments
4. **Optional Usage**: Agentic interface only suggests, never requires

## LLM-Driven Implementation Philosophy

### Intelligent Flexibility Over Rigid Rules

Rather than hard-coding analytical paths, KGAS leverages frontier LLMs' capabilities to:

1. **Contextual Adaptation**: LLMs assess each situation and adapt IC techniques appropriately
   - Simplify ACH for 3 theories vs full matrix for 50 theories
   - Skip information value assessment when sources are pre-curated
   - Adjust calibration based on domain expertise

2. **Human-Like Problem Solving**: When faced with complexity or ambiguity, LLMs:
   - Simplify methods while maintaining analytical rigor
   - Provide appropriate caveats and limitations
   - Suggest alternative approaches or next steps
   - Never fail silently - always provide useful output

3. **Dynamic Semantic Understanding**: For entity disambiguation and concept resolution:
   ```python
   # NOT hard-coded rules like:
   # if context == "computer_science": entity = "information_processing_cs"
   
   # BUT intelligent LLM reasoning:
   result = llm.analyze(f"""
   Given the text "{text}" in context "{context}", determine:
   1. What specific concept/entity is being referenced?
   2. How should it be distinguished from similar concepts in other domains?
   3. What domain-specific qualifier would prevent ambiguity?
   
   Reason step-by-step like a domain expert would.
   """)
   ```

4. **Evolving Analysis**: Support for hypotheses that change during research:
   - LLMs track conceptual evolution, not just text changes
   - Understand when refinements require evidence re-evaluation
   - Maintain analytical continuity across hypothesis versions

### Examples of LLM Flexibility

#### Information Value Assessment
```python
# LLM acts as intelligent research analyst
assessment = llm.analyze(f"""
As an expert research analyst, evaluate this information:
{source_info}

Given these competing hypotheses:
{hypotheses}

Determine:
1. Does this information help distinguish between hypotheses? (Diagnostic)
2. Does it support multiple hypotheses equally? (Consistent)
3. Does it contradict all current hypotheses? (Anomalous)
4. Is it irrelevant to the hypotheses? (Irrelevant)

Consider the research context and exercise judgment as a human expert would.
""")
```

#### Graceful Degradation
```python
# LLM handles complexity like a human analyst
approach = llm.determine_approach(f"""
Analytical situation:
- Number of theories: {len(theories)}
- Evidence pieces: {len(evidence)}
- Time constraints: {deadline}
- Domain expertise: {expertise_level}

As an expert analyst, determine the most appropriate approach:
1. Full ACH analysis if manageable
2. Simplified comparison of top theories if too complex
3. Narrative analysis with caveats if resources limited

Explain your reasoning and any limitations of the chosen approach.
""")
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2.1 (Immediate)
- Information Value Assessment in document processing
- Stopping Rules in collection orchestrator
- Basic Calibration in Quality Service

### Phase 2.2 (Near-term)
- T91: ACH Theory Competition Tool
- Full Calibration System with category tracking
- Probability language mapping

### Phase 3.0 (Future)
- Mental Model Auditing (pending LLM advancement)
- Cross-domain insight transfer
- Meta-analysis of research methods

## Technical Considerations

### Remaining Uncertainties

1. **Context Window Management**: Need strategies for massive hypothesis sets
2. **Novel Domain Confidence**: LLMs may struggle with cutting-edge areas
3. **User Trust**: Must demonstrate value through transparent reasoning

### Disambiguation Approach

For semantic drift across fields:
- Use qualified entity names: "information_processing_neuroscience" vs "information_processing_physics"
- LLM tags based on context
- Merge or split based on analysis needs

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Statistical Methods Only**: Rejected - doesn't address cognitive biases
2. **Full IC Workflow**: Rejected - too rigid for academic research
3. **Human-Only Analysis**: Rejected - misses LLM advantages in scale and consistency

# ADR-018: Analysis Version Control System

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Decision Makers**: KGAS Development Team  

## Context

Academic research is inherently iterative. Researchers refine hypotheses, explore alternative analytical approaches, and evolve their understanding over time. Current systems typically overwrite previous analyses or require manual copying, losing the research evolution history.

Key challenges in academic research that version control addresses:
- Need to explore alternative analytical approaches without losing work
- Requirement to document how understanding evolved for papers
- Desire to checkpoint analyses before major changes
- Need to share specific versions with collaborators or reviewers
- Ability to return to earlier analytical states

## Decision

We will implement a Git-like version control system for all KGAS analyses that allows:

1. **Checkpointing**: Save analysis state with descriptive messages
2. **Branching**: Explore alternative approaches in parallel
3. **History**: Track evolution of understanding over time
4. **Comparison**: See what changed between versions
5. **Collaboration**: Share specific versions with others

## Implementation Design

            methodology_changes=self.get_methodology_changes(version1, version2)
        )
```

## Version Control Features

### Automatic Checkpointing
```python
# Auto-checkpoint on significant changes
auto_checkpoint_triggers = [
    "major_hypothesis_change",
    "confidence_shift_over_20_percent",
    "new_evidence_contradicts_conclusion",
    "methodology_switch",
    "before_llm_model_change"
]
```

### Branch Strategies
```python
common_branch_patterns = {
    "alternative_theory": "Explore different theoretical framework",
    "methodology_comparison": "Try different analytical approach",
    "sensitivity_analysis": "Test with different parameters",
    "reviewer_response": "Address specific reviewer concerns",
    "collaborative_exploration": "Shared branch with collaborator"
}
```

### Version Metadata
```python
@dataclass
class VersionMetadata:
    # Core version info
    id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    message: str
    author: str
    
    # Research context
    research_stage: str  # "exploratory", "hypothesis_testing", "final"
    confidence_level: float
    major_findings: List[str]
    
    # Relationships
    parent_version: Optional[str]
    child_versions: List[str]
    branch_name: str
    tags: List[str]  # "submitted_to_journal", "shared_with_advisor"
```

## Integration with IC Features

Version control enhances IC analytical techniques:

1. **ACH Evolution**: Track how competing hypotheses evolved
2. **Calibration History**: See how confidence accuracy improved
3. **Information Value**: Compare which information actually changed conclusions
4. **Stopping Rules**: Document why collection stopped at each version

## Benefits

1. **Research Transparency**: Full history of analytical evolution
2. **Exploration Safety**: Try new approaches without losing work
3. **Collaboration**: Share specific versions with others
4. **Learning**: See how understanding developed over time
5. **Reproducibility**: Return to any previous analytical state

## Consequences

### Positive
- Encourages exploration and experimentation
- Documents research journey for papers
- Enables "what if" analysis safely
- Supports collaborative workflows
- Preserves institutional knowledge

### Negative
- Storage requirements for version history
- Complexity in UI for version management
- Learning curve for version control concepts
- Potential for "version sprawl"

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Checkpointing Only**: Rejected - doesn't support exploration
2. **Full Git Integration**: Rejected - too complex for researchers
3. **Manual Save As**: Rejected - loses relationships between versions

## Implementation Priority

Phase 2.2 - After core IC features are implemented

## Success Metrics

1. Average branches per analysis (target: 2-3)
2. Checkpoint frequency (target: 5-10 per analysis)
3. Version recovery usage (indicates trust in system)
4. Collaboration via shared versions
5. Research paper citations of version IDs

# ADR-019: Research Assistant Persona System

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Decision Makers**: KGAS Development Team  

## Context

Different research tasks benefit from different analytical perspectives. A critical peer reviewer finds weaknesses that a supportive colleague might miss. A methods expert provides different insights than a domain specialist. Current LLM systems typically maintain a single, consistent persona that may not be optimal for all research needs.

Research scenarios requiring different perspectives:
- Literature review needs comprehensive domain expertise
- Methodology design needs statistical rigor
- Pre-submission needs critical review
- Student support needs patient guidance
- Hypothesis generation needs creative thinking

## Decision

We will implement a Research Assistant Persona system that allows the LLM to adopt different expert personas based on the research task and user needs. Each persona will have distinct:

1. **Expertise focus**: What knowledge areas to emphasize
2. **Communication style**: How to interact with the researcher  
3. **Analytical approach**: What to prioritize in analysis
4. **Critical stance**: How skeptical or supportive to be
5. **Pedagogical approach**: How much to explain vs. assume

## Implementation Design

```python
class ResearchAssistantPersona:
    """Configurable LLM personas for different research needs"""
    
    # Core personas available to all users
    BASE_PERSONAS = {

## Persona Selection Guide

```python
class PersonaSelectionAdvisor:
    """Help users choose appropriate persona for their task"""
    
    def recommend_persona(self, task: ResearchTask) -> PersonaRecommendation:
        recommendations = {

        }
        
        primary = recommendations.get(task.type, ["collaborative_colleague"])[0]
        alternatives = recommendations.get(task.type, ["collaborative_colleague"])[1:]
        
        return PersonaRecommendation(

        initial_ideas = self.explore_question(research_question)
        
        # Switch to domain expert for literature
        self.personas.adopt("domain_expert")

# ADR-020: Agent-Based Modeling Integration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Context**: KGAS currently focuses on descriptive analysis of social phenomena but lacks capability to validate theories through simulation or explore counterfactual scenarios

## Context

KGAS is designed as a theory-aware computational social science platform with strong capabilities in:
- Cross-modal analysis (graph/table/vector)
- Theory operationalization through schemas
- Uncertainty quantification and provenance tracking
- Academic research workflows

However, the current architecture is purely **analytical/descriptive** - it can analyze existing social phenomena but cannot:
- **Validate theories** through controlled simulation
- **Test counterfactuals** ("what if" scenarios)
- **Generate synthetic data** for theory testing
- **Explore emergent behaviors** from theoretical assumptions

Recent advances in **Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM)** using Large Language Models (Concordia framework, Google DeepMind) enable sophisticated theory-driven agent simulations that could complement KGAS's analytical capabilities.

## Decision

**Integrate Agent-Based Modeling capabilities into KGAS as a new architectural layer for theory validation and synthetic experiment generation.**

## KGAS Theory Meta-Schema v10 to ABM Translation

The theory meta-schema v10 provides a comprehensive framework for translating KGAS theories into agent-based models. This section demonstrates how schema components map to agent configurations.

### Translation Framework Overview

```python
class TheoryToABMTranslator:
    """Translates KGAS theory meta-schema v10 to ABM agent configurations"""
    
    def __init__(self, theory_schema: Dict):
        self.schema = theory_schema
        self.agent_factory = KGASTheoryDrivenAgent
        self.environment_builder = TheoryEnvironmentBuilder()
    
    def translate_theory_to_agents(self) -> List[AgentConfiguration]:
        """Main translation method"""
        # Extract entities from ontology
        entities = self.schema['ontology']['entities']
        
        # Create agent configurations for each entity type
        agent_configs = []
        for entity in entities:
            config = self._create_agent_config_from_entity(entity)
            agent_configs.append(config)
        
        return agent_configs
    
    def _create_agent_config_from_entity(self, entity: Dict) -> AgentConfiguration:
        """Convert theory entity to agent configuration"""
        agent_config = AgentConfiguration(
            agent_type=entity['name'],
            behavioral_rules=self._extract_behavioral_rules(entity),
            decision_framework=self._extract_decision_framework(entity),
            measurement_approach=self._extract_measurement_approach(entity),
            interaction_patterns=self._extract_interaction_patterns(entity)
        )
        return agent_config
```

### Example 1: Stakeholder Theory Translation

Using the stakeholder theory v10 schema as an example:

```python
# From stakeholder_theory_v10.json
stakeholder_entity = {
    "name": "Stakeholder",
    "properties": [
        {"name": "legitimacy", "type": "float", "operationalization": {...}},
        {"name": "urgency", "type": "float", "operationalization": {...}},
        {"name": "power", "type": "float", "operationalization": {...}}
    ]
}

        super().__init__(agent_id, "Stakeholder")
        
        # Agent state from theory properties
        self.legitimacy = legitimacy  # 0-1 scale from operationalization
        self.urgency = urgency       # 0-1 scale from operationalization  
        self.power = power           # 0-1 scale from operationalization
        
        # Calculated salience using Mitchell-Agle-Wood model

    def _assess_organizational_impact(self, context: SimulationContext) -> Dict:
        """Behavioral rule derived from HAS_STAKE_IN relationship"""
        organization = context.get_organization()
        
        # Calculate stake strength from relationship properties
        stake_strength = self._evaluate_stake_strength(organization)
        
        return {
            'action': 'assess_impact',
            'stake_strength': stake_strength,
            'concerns': self._identify_concerns(organization)
        }
    
    def _determine_influence_strategy(self, context: SimulationContext) -> Dict:
        """Strategy based on power operationalization"""
        if self.power > 0.8:
            strategy = "direct_pressure"
        elif self.power > 0.5:
            strategy = "coalition_building" 
        else:
            strategy = "public_appeal"
        
        return {'influence_strategy': strategy, 'power_level': self.power}
    
    def step(self, context: SimulationContext) -> List[Dict]:
        """Execute theory-driven behavior"""
        actions = []
        
        # Apply behavioral rules in sequence
        for rule in self.behavioral_rules:

        # Update salience based on context changes
        self._update_salience(context)
        
        return actions
```

### Example 2: Framing Theory Translation

Using the Carter framing theory schema:

```python
# From carter_framing_theory_schema.yml
framing_analysis = {
    "frames_in_communication": [
        {"frame": "Peace Frame", "considerations": ["mutual benefit", "shared humanity"]},
        {"frame": "Security Frame", "considerations": ["strategic balance", "deterrence"]},
        {"frame": "Values Frame", "considerations": ["human rights", "moral leadership"]}
    ],
    "psychological_mechanisms": {
        "accessibility": "Vietnam/Watergate memories activate credibility concerns",
        "applicability": "Universal human values connect with audience beliefs"
    }
}

# Translates to:

        # Agent cognitive state from theory
        self.frame_preference = frame_preference  # "peace", "security", "values", "realism"

            self._evaluate_frame_strength,
            self._update_attitude_formation,
            self._generate_response
        ]
    
    def _process_frame_exposure(self, context: SimulationContext) -> Dict:
        """Implement accessibility mechanism from theory"""
        exposed_frames = context.get_current_frames()
        
        for frame in exposed_frames:
            # Theory: "Frame Exposure → Consideration Activation → Attitude Formation"
            considerations = self._activate_considerations(frame)
            self.active_considerations.extend(considerations)
            
        return {
            'action': 'frame_processing',
            'activated_considerations': self.active_considerations
        }
    
    def _evaluate_frame_strength(self, context: SimulationContext) -> Dict:
        """Implement competitive_dynamics from causal_analysis"""
        competing_frames = context.get_competing_frames()
        
        # Theory: "Stronger frames dominate weaker ones"
        frame_strengths = {}
        for frame in competing_frames:
            strength = self._calculate_frame_appeal(frame)
            frame_strengths[frame.id] = strength
            
        dominant_frame = max(frame_strengths, key=frame_strengths.get)
        
        return {
            'action': 'frame_evaluation',
            'dominant_frame': dominant_frame,
            'frame_competition_result': frame_strengths
        }
    
    def _update_attitude_formation(self, context: SimulationContext) -> Dict:

        # Theory: "Attitude = Σ(value_i × weight_i)"
        key_values = ["peace", "security", "credibility", "moral_leadership"]
        
        attitude_score = 0
        for value in key_values:
            value_weight = self._get_value_weight(value)
            value_importance = self._get_value_importance(value, context)
            attitude_score += value_weight * value_importance
            
        self.current_attitude = attitude_score
        
        return {
            'action': 'attitude_update',
            'attitude_score': attitude_score,
            'value_weights': {v: self._get_value_weight(v) for v in key_values}
        }
```

### Cross-Modal Agent Representation

Agents can represent themselves across different analytical modes as specified in the schema's cross_modal_mappings:

```python
class MultiModalAgent(KGASTheoryDrivenAgent):
    def get_graph_representation(self) -> Dict:
        """Agent as graph node with properties"""
        return {
            'node_id': self.agent_id,
            'node_type': self.agent_type,
            'properties': {
                'salience_score': getattr(self, 'salience', 0),
                'legitimacy': getattr(self, 'legitimacy', 0),
                'urgency': getattr(self, 'urgency', 0),
                'power': getattr(self, 'power', 0)
            },
            'edges': self._get_relationship_edges()
        }
    
    def get_table_representation(self) -> Dict:
        """Agent as table row with calculated metrics"""
        return {
            'agent_id': self.agent_id,
            'agent_type': self.agent_type,
            'salience_score': getattr(self, 'salience', 0),
            'influence_rank': self._calculate_influence_rank(),
            'network_centrality': self._calculate_centrality(),
            'cluster_membership': self._get_cluster_id()
        }
    
    def get_vector_representation(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """Agent as embedding vector for similarity analysis"""
        behavioral_features = self._extract_behavioral_features()
        communication_features = self._extract_communication_features()
        return np.concatenate([behavioral_features, communication_features])
```

### Dynamic Adaptation Implementation

For theories with dynamic_adaptation specifications:

```python
class AdaptiveAgent(KGASTheoryDrivenAgent):
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str, theory_schema: Dict):
        super().__init__(agent_id, "AdaptiveAgent")
        
        # Initialize state variables from schema
        dynamic_config = theory_schema.get('dynamic_adaptation', {})
        self.state_variables = {}
        
        for var_name, var_config in dynamic_config.get('state_variables', {}).items():
            self.state_variables[var_name] = var_config['initial']
        
        # Store adaptation rules and triggers
        self.adaptation_triggers = dynamic_config.get('adaptation_triggers', [])
        self.adaptation_rules = dynamic_config.get('adaptation_rules', [])
    
    def step(self, context: SimulationContext) -> List[Dict]:
        """Execute with dynamic adaptation"""
        # Normal behavior execution
        actions = super().step(context)
        
        # Check adaptation triggers
        for trigger in self.adaptation_triggers:
            if self._evaluate_condition(trigger['condition'], context):
                self._execute_adaptation(trigger['action'])
        
        return actions
    
    def _evaluate_condition(self, condition: str, context: SimulationContext) -> bool:
        """Evaluate adaptation trigger condition"""
        # Parse condition like "minority_visibility < 0.3"
        # Use safe evaluation with current state and context
        evaluation_context = {
            **self.state_variables,
            'context': context
        }
        
        return eval(condition, {"__builtins__": {}}, evaluation_context)
    
    def _execute_adaptation(self, action: str):
        """Execute adaptation action like 'increase_spiral_strength'"""
        # Apply adaptation rules
        for rule in self.adaptation_rules:
            if action in rule:
                # Execute rule like "spiral_strength *= 1.2 when minority_visibility decreases"
                self._apply_adaptation_rule(rule)
```

### Validation Integration

Agent behavior validation using theory test cases from the schema:

```python
class TheoryValidationFramework:
    def __init__(self, theory_schema: Dict, agent_population: List[KGASTheoryDrivenAgent]):
        self.schema = theory_schema
        self.agents = agent_population
        self.validation_config = theory_schema.get('validation', {})
    
    def run_theory_tests(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:
        """Execute theory_tests from validation section"""
        results = {}
        
        for test in self.validation_config.get('theory_tests', []):
            test_result = self._execute_theory_test(test)
            results[test['test_name']] = test_result
        
        return results
    
    def _execute_theory_test(self, test: Dict) -> bool:
        """Execute individual theory test"""
        # Set up scenario from input_scenario
        scenario = self._create_test_scenario(test['input_scenario'])
        
        # Run simulation with test scenario
        simulation_result = self._run_test_simulation(scenario)
        
        # Validate against expected_theory_application and validation_criteria
        return self._validate_result(simulation_result, test)
    
    def check_boundary_cases(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Handle boundary_cases from validation section"""
        boundary_results = []
        
        for case in self.validation_config.get('boundary_cases', []):
            case_result = self._handle_boundary_case(case)
            boundary_results.append(case_result)
        
        return boundary_results
```

This translation framework demonstrates how KGAS theory meta-schema v10 components directly map to agent-based model configurations, enabling automated theory-to-simulation translation while maintaining theoretical fidelity and validation capabilities.

## Architecture Design

### Research-Informed Design Principles

Based on recent advances in generative agent research (Park et al. 2024, Lu et al. 2025, Gui & Toubia 2025), KGAS ABM incorporates:

1. **Rich Individual Parameterization**: Following Stanford's approach, agents use deep individual profiles beyond demographics
2. **Objective Accuracy Focus**: Emphasis on measurable accuracy metrics rather than subjective believability
3. **Unblinded Experimental Design**: Explicit experimental design communication to avoid confounding
4. **Expert Reflection Architecture**: Domain expert synthesis of agent characteristics from theory schemas
5. **Reasoning-Enhanced Agents**: Synthesized reasoning traces to improve decision accuracy
6. **Real-World Behavioral Validation**: Validation against actual behavioral datasets (COVID dataset)

### 1. ABM Service Layer

Add ABM capabilities as a new service in the Core Services Layer:

```python
class ABMService:
    """Agent-Based Modeling service for theory validation and simulation"""
    
    def __init__(self, theory_repository, knowledge_graphs, uncertainty_engine):
        self.theory_repository = theory_repository
        self.knowledge_graphs = knowledge_graphs
        self.uncertainty_engine = uncertainty_engine
        self.simulation_engine = GABMSimulationEngine()
        self.validation_engine = TheoryValidationEngine()
    
    def create_theory_simulation(self, theory_id: str) -> SimulationConfiguration:
        """Convert KGAS theory schema to GABM simulation parameters"""
        
    def run_simulation_experiment(self, config: SimulationConfiguration) -> SimulationResults:
        """Execute controlled ABM experiment with uncertainty tracking"""
        
    def validate_theory_predictions(self, theory_id: str, real_data: DataFrame) -> ValidationReport:
        """Compare simulation results to empirical data"""
```

### 2. Rich Individual Agent Architecture

Incorporating insights from Stanford's interview-based agents and reasoning-enhanced approaches:

```python
class KGASTheoryDrivenAgent(GenerativeAgent):
    """GABM agent with rich individual parameterization and expert reflection"""
    
    def __init__(self, theory_schema: TheoryMetaSchema, agent_profile: RichAgentProfile):
        # Core agent identity from multiple sources (Stanford approach)
        self.agent_id = agent_profile.agent_id
        self.theory_id = theory_schema.theory_id
        
        # Rich individual parameterization beyond demographics
        self.individual_profile = self._create_rich_profile(agent_profile)
        self.expert_reflection = self._synthesize_expert_insights(theory_schema, agent_profile)

        # Extract behavioral features from both datasets
        simulated_features = self.extract_behavioral_features(simulated_behaviors)
        real_features = self.extract_behavioral_features(real_behaviors)
        
        # Calculate similarity using multiple metrics
        correlation_similarity = self.calculate_correlation(simulated_features, real_features)
        distribution_similarity = self.calculate_distribution_similarity(simulated_features, real_features)
        temporal_similarity = self.calculate_temporal_similarity(simulated_features, real_features)
        
        return (correlation_similarity + distribution_similarity + temporal_similarity) / 3
```

```

### 3. Tool Ecosystem Extension

```

## Rationale

### Why ABM Integration Is Strategic

1. **Complements Analytical Capabilities**: KGAS analyzes existing data; ABM validates theories through simulation
2. **Leverages Existing Architecture**: Theory schemas, uncertainty framework, and cross-modal analysis enhance ABM
3. **Academic Research Value**: Theory validation through simulation is cutting-edge computational social science
4. **Real Dataset Validation**: COVID conspiracy dataset provides ground truth for validation
5. **Publication Opportunities**: GABM validation of social science theories is highly publishable

### Why Now

1. **GABM Technology Maturity**: Concordia framework proves LLM-based ABM is feasible
2. **KGAS Foundation Ready**: Theory operationalization and uncertainty framework provide perfect foundation
3. **Validation Dataset Available**: COVID conspiracy dataset enables immediate validation capability
4. **Research Gap**: No existing platforms combine theory-driven ABM with cross-modal analysis

### Technical Advantages

1. **Theory-Driven Parameterization**: Unlike generic ABM, agents are parameterized by academic theories
2. **Uncertainty-Aware Simulation**: Incorporates KGAS's sophisticated uncertainty framework
3. **Cross-Modal Environments**: Uses graph/table/vector data to create rich simulation environments
4. **Empirical Validation**: Built-in validation against real behavioral data

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Complete Research Platform**: KGAS becomes analysis + validation platform
2. **Theory Testing Capability**: Researchers can test theories through controlled experiments
3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate realistic social science data for training/testing
4. **Academic Impact**: Positions KGAS at forefront of computational social science
5. **Validation Evidence**: Built-in validation against real psychological/behavioral data

### Challenges

1. **Complexity Increase**: ABM adds significant architectural complexity
2. **Resource Requirements**: Simulations are computationally intensive
3. **Validation Complexity**: Ensuring simulation realism requires sophisticated validation
4. **Development Time**: ABM integration requires substantial development effort

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Phased Implementation**: Start with simple theory-agent translation, add complexity gradually
2. **Validation-First Approach**: Use COVID dataset validation to ensure realism from start
3. **Resource Management**: Implement intelligent resource allocation for simulations
4. **Academic Partnerships**: Collaborate with ABM researchers for domain expertise

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Basic theory-to-agent translation
- Simple simulation engine integration
- COVID dataset validation framework

### Phase 2: Cross-Modal Integration (Months 4-6)
- Cross-modal environment generation
- Uncertainty-aware simulation
- Empirical validation automation

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Months 7-12)
- Counterfactual exploration tools
- Synthetic data generation
- Emergent behavior detection
- Academic publication support

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: External ABM Integration
**Approach**: Integrate with existing ABM platforms (NetLogo, MASON)
**Rejected Because**: 
- Traditional ABM lacks LLM-based agent sophistication
- Integration complexity without GABM benefits
- No theory-driven parameterization capability

### Alternative 2: Pure Analytical Focus
**Approach**: Keep KGAS purely analytical, no simulation
**Rejected Because**:
- Misses opportunity to validate theories through simulation
- Limits research impact and publication opportunities
- Doesn't leverage full potential of theory operationalization

### Alternative 3: Separate ABM Platform
**Approach**: Build separate ABM platform, integrate via API
**Rejected Because**:
- Loses integration benefits with uncertainty framework
- Duplicates architecture and increases maintenance
- Fragments user experience across platforms

## KGAS Theory Meta-Schema v10 to ABM Translation

Based on analysis of your theory meta-schema v10 structure and examples (Stakeholder Theory v10.json, Carter Framing Analysis YAML), here's how KGAS theories directly map to ABM agents:

### Theory Schema → Agent Behavioral Rules Mapping

**From Stakeholder Theory Schema:**
```python
# Mitchell-Agle-Wood Salience Algorithm → Agent Behavioral Rule
salience_rule = BehavioralRule(
    rule_id="stakeholder_priority_response",
    behavioral_tendency="priority_response = (legitimacy * urgency * power) ** (1/3)",
    custom_script=theory_schema['execution']['analysis_steps'][4]['custom_script'],
    test_cases=theory_schema['validation']['theory_tests'],
    operationalization=theory_schema['validation']['operationalization_notes']
)
```

**From Carter Framing Theory Analysis:**
```python
# Frame Competition Mechanism → Agent Decision Process
frame_competition_rule = BehavioralRule(
    rule_id="frame_competition_response",
    behavioral_tendency="""
    frame_strength = cultural_resonance * logical_coherence * source_credibility
    response_probability = sigmoid(dominant_frame_strength - competing_frame_strength)
    """,
    psychological_mechanisms=['accessibility', 'availability', 'applicability'],
    causal_analysis=carter_schema['causal_analysis']['competitive_dynamics']
)
```

### Theory Operationalization → Agent Measurement Sensitivity

**From Stakeholder Theory Legitimacy Property:**
```python
# Operationalization boundaries → Agent assessment patterns
legitimacy_assessment = MeasurementApproach(
    boundary_rules=theory_schema['ontology']['entities'][0]['properties'][0]['operationalization']['boundary_rules'],
    # {"condition": "legal_right == true", "legitimacy": 0.8}
    # {"condition": "moral_claim == true", "legitimacy": 0.6}
    validation_examples=theory_schema['validation']['theory_tests'],
    fuzzy_boundaries=True
)
```

### Theory Execution Steps → Agent Decision Framework

**From Stakeholder Theory Analysis Steps:**
```python
# LLM extraction prompts → Agent reasoning processes
stakeholder_identification = ReasoningProcess(
    reasoning_prompt=theory_schema['execution']['analysis_steps'][0]['llm_prompts']['extraction_prompt'],
    validation_prompt=theory_schema['execution']['analysis_steps'][0]['llm_prompts']['validation_prompt'],
    confidence_thresholds=theory_schema['execution']['analysis_steps'][0]['uncertainty_handling']['confidence_thresholds']
)
```

### Cross-Modal Mappings → Agent Environment Integration

**From Theory Cross-Modal Specifications:**
```python
# Cross-modal mappings → Agent environment understanding
agent_environment_mapping = {
    'graph_mode': theory_schema['execution']['cross_modal_mappings']['graph_representation'],
    'table_mode': theory_schema['execution']['cross_modal_mappings']['table_representation'], 
    'vector_mode': theory_schema['execution']['cross_modal_mappings']['vector_representation']
}
```

### Key Insights from Schema Analysis

1. **Rich Operationalization**: Your v10 schemas contain detailed operationalization with boundary rules, validation examples, and confidence thresholds - perfect for agent parameterization
2. **Executable Algorithms**: Custom scripts (like Mitchell-Agle-Wood salience) can be directly implemented as agent behavioral algorithms
3. **LLM Prompts Ready**: Extraction and validation prompts can be repurposed as agent reasoning templates
4. **Validation Framework**: Theory tests provide ready-made validation scenarios for agent behavior
5. **Cross-Modal Support**: Agents can naturally work across graph/table/vector modes using your mappings

### Theory-Agent Translation Pipeline

```python
class KGASTheoryToAgentPipeline:
    """Complete pipeline for translating v10 schemas to ABM agents"""
    
    def translate_theory_schema(self, theory_schema_path: str, 
                              covid_dataset: CovidDataset) -> List[KGASTheoryDrivenAgent]:
        
        # Step 1: Parse theory schema
        theory_schema = self.load_theory_schema(theory_schema_path)
        
        # Step 2: Create agent population from COVID dataset
        agent_profiles = self.create_agent_profiles_from_covid_data(
            covid_dataset, theory_schema
        )
        
        # Step 3: Translate schema to agent behavioral components
        behavioral_rules = self.extract_behavioral_rules(theory_schema)
        decision_framework = self.create_decision_framework(theory_schema['execution'])
        measurement_approaches = self.extract_measurement_approaches(theory_schema['ontology'])
        
        # Step 4: Create theory-driven agents
        agents = []
        for profile in agent_profiles:
            agent = KGASTheoryDrivenAgent(
                theory_schema=theory_schema,
                agent_profile=profile,
                behavioral_rules=behavioral_rules,
                decision_framework=decision_framework,
                measurement_approaches=measurement_approaches
            )
            agents.append(agent)
        
        return agents
```

This translation framework demonstrates that your sophisticated theory meta-schema v10 already contains all the components needed for creating behaviorally accurate ABM agents - operationalization details, measurement approaches, validation frameworks, executable algorithms, and even specific LLM prompts.

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
1. **Simulation Performance**: Able to run 1000+ agent simulations within reasonable time
2. **Validation Accuracy**: >0.75 correlation with COVID dataset behavioral patterns
3. **Theory Coverage**: Support for major social science theories (>10 theory domains)
4. **Uncertainty Propagation**: Accurate uncertainty tracking through simulation pipelines

### Research Impact Metrics
1. **Academic Publications**: Enable 5+ publications in computational social science venues
2. **User Adoption**: 100+ researchers using ABM capabilities within 18 months
3. **Theory Validation**: Successful validation of 20+ existing social science theories
4. **Synthetic Data Quality**: Generated data indistinguishable from real data in blind tests

### Platform Integration Metrics
1. **Cross-Modal Utilization**: ABM uses all three data modes (graph/table/vector)
2. **Tool Ecosystem**: ABM tools integrate seamlessly with existing 121+ tools
3. **Workflow Integration**: ABM accessible through all three agent interface layers
4. **Provenance Tracking**: Complete audit trails for all simulation operations

## Conclusion

Integrating Agent-Based Modeling capabilities into KGAS represents a strategic evolution from a descriptive analysis platform to a complete theory validation and synthetic experimentation platform. The combination of KGAS's theory operationalization, uncertainty framework, and cross-modal analysis with GABM's generative simulation capabilities creates a unique and powerful platform for computational social science research.

The availability of the COVID conspiracy theory dataset for validation provides immediate capability to demonstrate ABM effectiveness, while the sophisticated theoretical foundation of KGAS ensures that simulations are grounded in rigorous academic theory rather than ad-hoc assumptions.

This integration positions KGAS as a next-generation research platform that can both analyze existing social phenomena and validate theoretical understanding through controlled simulation experiments.

# ADR-021: Statistical Analysis and SEM Integration

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Context**: KGAS currently lacks comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities, particularly Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and advanced multivariate analysis tools needed for rigorous quantitative research

## Context

KGAS is designed as a theory-aware computational social science platform with strong capabilities in:
- Cross-modal analysis (graph/table/vector)
- Theory operationalization through schemas
- Network and graph analytics
- Uncertainty quantification

However, the current architecture has **limited statistical analysis capabilities**:
- Only basic descriptive statistics planned (T41 - not implemented)
- Only correlation analysis documented (T42 - not implemented)
- **No SEM capabilities** whatsoever
- Missing multivariate analysis tools
- No regression modeling framework
- No experimental design tools

For comprehensive quantitative research, particularly in social sciences, advanced statistical capabilities including SEM are essential for:
- Testing theoretical models with latent variables
- Analyzing complex causal relationships
- Validating measurement instruments
- Conducting multivariate hypothesis testing
- Performing meta-analyses and systematic reviews

## Decision

**Integrate comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities including SEM into KGAS, leveraging the cross-modal architecture to enable novel statistical-network-semantic integrated analyses.**

## Architecture Design

### 1. Statistical Analysis Service Layer

Add statistical capabilities as a new service in the Core Services Layer:

```python
class StatisticalModelingService:
    """Comprehensive statistical analysis service including SEM"""
    
    def __init__(self, data_service, theory_repository, cross_modal_converter):
        self.data_service = data_service
        self.theory_repository = theory_repository
        self.cross_modal_converter = cross_modal_converter
        
        # Statistical engines
        self.descriptive_engine = DescriptiveStatsEngine()
        self.inferential_engine = InferentialStatsEngine()
        self.sem_engine = SEMEngine()
        self.multivariate_engine = MultivariateAnalysisEngine()
        self.experimental_design = ExperimentalDesignEngine()
    
    async def run_sem_analysis(self, theory_schema: Dict, data: DataFrame) -> SEMResults:
        """Run SEM analysis based on theory specification"""
        # Convert theory schema to SEM specification
        sem_spec = self._theory_to_sem_specification(theory_schema)
        
        # Fit SEM model
        model_results = await self.sem_engine.fit_model(data, sem_spec)
        
        # Convert results to cross-modal format
        return self._create_cross_modal_results(model_results)
    
    def _theory_to_sem_specification(self, theory_schema: Dict) -> SEMSpecification:
        """Convert KGAS theory schema to SEM model specification"""
        return SEMSpecification(
            latent_variables=self._extract_latent_constructs(theory_schema),
            measurement_model=self._build_measurement_model(theory_schema),
            structural_model=self._build_structural_model(theory_schema),
            constraints=self._extract_model_constraints(theory_schema)

        return graph
```

### 6. Statistical Workflow Integration

Integrate statistical analysis into KGAS workflows:

    """Orchestrate statistical analysis workflows"""
    
    def __init__(self, orchestrator: PipelineOrchestrator):
        self.orchestrator = orchestrator
        self.statistical_service = StatisticalModelingService()

    async def theory_driven_sem_workflow(self, theory_id: str, data_source: str):
        """Complete workflow from theory to SEM results"""
        
        # Load theory schema
        theory = await self.orchestrator.theory_repository.get_theory(theory_id)
        
        # Load and prepare data
        data = await self.orchestrator.load_data(data_source)
        
        # Generate SEM specification from theory
        sem_spec = self.statistical_service.theory_to_sem_specification(theory)
        
        # Fit SEM model
        sem_results = await self.statistical_service.run_sem_analysis(sem_spec, data)
        
        # Convert to cross-modal representations
        graph_repr = self.cross_modal_service.sem_to_graph(sem_results)
        vector_repr = self.cross_modal_service.sem_to_embeddings(sem_results)
        
        # Run additional analyses on graph representation
        network_metrics = await self.orchestrator.graph_service.analyze_sem_network(graph_repr)
        
        # Generate integrated report
        return IntegratedStatisticalReport(
            sem_results=sem_results,
            network_analysis=network_metrics,
            cross_modal_insights=self._integrate_insights(sem_results, network_metrics),
            visualization_data=self._prepare_visualizations(sem_results, graph_repr)
        )
```

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### 1. Service Layer Integration

    cross_modal_converter=existing_converter
)

# Register with service manager
service_manager.register_service('statistical_modeling', statistical_service)
```

### 2. Data Architecture Extension

```sql
-- SQLite: Statistical model metadata
CREATE TABLE statistical_models (
    model_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    model_type TEXT,  -- 'sem', 'regression', 'factor_analysis', etc.
    theory_id TEXT,
    specification JSON,
    creation_time TIMESTAMP,

    fit_indices JSON,
    parameters JSON,
    diagnostics JSON,
    cross_modal_representations JSON,

```

```cypher
-- Neo4j: Statistical model as graph
CREATE (:LatentVariable {
    name: string,
    model_id: string,
    variance: float,
    mean: float
})

CREATE (:ManifestVariable {
    name: string,
    model_id: string,

    observed_variance: float
})

CREATE (:LatentVariable)-[:MEASURES {

}]->(:ManifestVariable)

CREATE (:LatentVariable)-[:INFLUENCES {
    coefficient: float,
    std_error: float,
    p_value: float
}]->(:LatentVariable)
```

### 3. Theory Schema Extension

Add statistical specifications to theory meta-schema v10:

```json
{
  "theory_id": "example_theory",
  "statistical_models": {
    "primary_sem": {
      "latent_variables": [
        {
          "name": "satisfaction",
          "indicators": ["sat1", "sat2", "sat3"],
          "scale_identification": "first_loading_fixed"
        }
      ],
      "structural_paths": [
        {
          "from": "legitimacy",
          "to": "satisfaction",
          "hypothesis": "positive",
          "expected_range": [0.3, 0.7]
        }
      ],
      "model_constraints": [
        "covariance(error.sat1, error.sat2) = 0"
      ],
      "fit_criteria": {
        "cfi": ">= 0.95",
        "rmsea": "<= 0.06",
        "srmr": "<= 0.08"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Rationale

### Why Statistical Integration Is Critical

3. **Cross-Modal Innovation**: Converting statistical models to graphs enables novel analyses
4. **Academic Standards**: Meets publication requirements for statistical rigor
5. **Competitive Advantage**: Few platforms integrate advanced statistics with graph/semantic analysis

### Why This Architecture Works

1. **Leverages Existing Strengths**: Cross-modal architecture naturally handles statistical-to-graph conversion
2. **Theory Integration**: Theory schemas can specify statistical models directly
3. **Service Architecture**: Clean integration without disrupting existing components
4. **Tool Ecosystem**: Fits naturally into T43-T60 tool range
5. **Academic Focus**: Aligns with KGAS's research-oriented design

### Technical Advantages

1. **Best-of-Breed Libraries**: Leverage lavaan (R) and semopy (Python)
2. **Cross-Modal Innovation**: Statistical results become graph structures for network analysis
3. **Theory-Driven Automation**: Generate SEM models from theory specifications
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: From basic descriptives to advanced SEM and Bayesian methods
5. **Uncertainty Integration**: Statistical uncertainty flows through cross-modal transformations
