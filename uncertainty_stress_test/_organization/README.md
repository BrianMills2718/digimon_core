- Experimental validation reports

## üéØ Current Focus Areas

Based on the file organization, the **useful scripts** show that you have:

1. **Working LLM Personality Prediction System** with 4 strategies:
   - Direct Survey Mapping (works: r=0.75-0.81 for political)
   - Behavioral Pattern Analysis
   - Comparative Assessment  
   - Multi-Perspective Analysis

2. **Alternative Prediction Methods** ready for comparison:
   - BERT predictor
   - Traditional ML (Random Forest/XGBoost)
   - Bayesian predictor
   - Transformer models
   - Linguistic/temporal/network analysis

3. **Advanced Uncertainty Analysis Infrastructure**:
   - LLM-powered Bayesian evidence aggregation
   - CERQual research quality assessment framework
   - Formal Bayesian mathematics with LLM parameters
   - Confidence scoring and uncertainty quantification engines

4. **Missing Piece**: Comprehensive evaluation comparing ALL methods across ALL 4 personality scales, potentially enhanced with uncertainty quantification

## üöÄ Next Steps

The useful scripts contain everything needed to:

1. **Generate comprehensive correlation table** showing r values for each method on each personality dimension (Political, Narcissism, Conspiracy, Denialism)

2. **Enhance with uncertainty quantification** using the core_services engines to provide confidence intervals and evidence quality assessments for predictions

3. **Integrate personality prediction with broader uncertainty analysis framework** - personality prediction appears to be one component of a larger knowledge analysis system

## üìä File Counts
- Total files analyzed: ~200
- **Useful scripts: 45+ across 8 specialized directories** (complete infrastructure)
- Non-useful scripts: ~35 (experimental/legacy remaining in archive)  
- Useful documentation: 15 (current guides)
- Non-useful documentation: ~55 (outdated/draft)

## üéØ **Complete Infrastructure Now Active:**
