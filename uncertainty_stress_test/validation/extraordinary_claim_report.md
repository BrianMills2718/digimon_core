# Formal Bayesian Analysis Report

## Claim Assessment
**Claim**: Cold fusion technology can produce net positive energy output
**Domain**: nuclear_physics
**Methodology**: formal_bayesian_with_llm_parameters

## Bayesian Results
**Posterior Belief**: 0.0657
**95% Confidence Interval**: [0.0010, 0.4762]
**Belief Change**: +0.0557

## Mathematical Analysis
**Bayes Factor**: 16.0000 (Strong evidence for hypothesis)
**Evidence Strength**: Strong positive update
**Update Magnitude**: Minor belief change

## Bayesian Parameters (LLM-Determined)
**Prior Belief P(H)**: 0.0100
**Likelihood P(E|H)**: 0.8000
**Likelihood P(E|¬H)**: 0.0500
**Evidence Weight**: 0.7000
**Evidence Quality**: 1.0000

## LLM Reasoning for Parameters
**Prior Belief**: Given the history of failed attempts and the contradiction with established nuclear physics principles, the prior belief in the claim is very low. However, it's not zero because scientific breakthroughs can and do occur.

**Prior Confidence**: The confidence in this prior is relatively high because it's based on a substantial body of scientific evidence and consensus. However, it's not at the maximum because of the possibility of scientific breakthroughs.

**Likelihood Given H**: If the claim were true, it's quite likely we would see evidence like this: a research team with consistent results, sound methodology, and calibrated equipment. However, the lack of independent replication reduces this likelihood somewhat.

**Likelihood Given Not H**: If the claim were false, it's quite unlikely we would see evidence like this. It's possible that the team is mistaken or fraudulent, but the described rigor of their work makes this less likely.

**Evidence Weight**: The evidence should be given substantial weight because it's based on experimental results and appears rigorous. However, the lack of independent replication and the contradiction with established principles reduce its weight somewhat.

**Bayes Factor Interpretation**: The Bayes factor suggests that the evidence is substantially more likely if the claim is true than if it's false. However, given the low prior belief and the reduced weight of the evidence, this doesn't necessarily mean the claim is likely to be true.


## Mathematical Specification
The analysis follows formal Bayesian updating:

1. **Bayes' Theorem**: P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)
2. **Bayes Factor**: BF = P(E|H) / P(E|¬H) = 16.0000
3. **Posterior Odds**: P(H|E) / P(¬H|E) = BF × P(H) / P(¬H)
4. **Evidence Weighting**: Effective BF = BF^(weight × quality)

## Bayesian Update Details
- **Prior Odds**: 0.0101
- **Posterior Odds**: 0.0703
- **Odds Ratio**: 6.9644
- **Log Bayes Factor**: 2.7726
- **Marginal Likelihood P(E)**: 0.0575

## Methodological Notes
- **Parameter Determination**: LLM-based assessment of Bayesian parameters
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Formal Bayesian updating with confidence bounds
- **Evidence Weighting**: Partial updating based on evidence quality and weight
- **Reproducibility**: Same methodology with potential parameter variation (like human analysts)
