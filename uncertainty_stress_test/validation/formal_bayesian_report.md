# Formal Bayesian Analysis Report

## Claim Assessment
**Claim**: Treatment X significantly reduces mortality compared to standard care
**Domain**: medical_research
**Methodology**: formal_bayesian_with_llm_parameters

## Bayesian Results
**Posterior Belief**: 0.9643
**95% Confidence Interval**: [0.8520, 0.9990]
**Belief Change**: +0.4643

## Mathematical Analysis
**Bayes Factor**: 9.0000 (Moderate evidence for hypothesis)
**Evidence Strength**: Very strong positive update
**Update Magnitude**: Major belief revision

## Bayesian Parameters (LLM-Determined)
**Prior Belief P(H)**: 0.5000
**Likelihood P(E|H)**: 0.9000
**Likelihood P(E|¬H)**: 0.1000
**Evidence Weight**: 1.0000
**Evidence Quality**: 1.5000

## LLM Reasoning for Parameters
**Prior Belief**: Given the domain of medical research, it is reasonable to start with a neutral prior belief of 0.5. This is because medical treatments can often have varying effects and it is not uncommon for a new treatment to be effective.

**Prior Confidence**: The confidence in the prior is relatively high (7.0) because the domain of medical research is well-established and rigorous. However, there is always room for new discoveries and improvements.

**Likelihood Given H**: If the claim is true, the likelihood of observing this evidence is high (0.9). This is because the study was large, randomized, controlled, and published in a reputable journal. The results were statistically significant and the follow-up was nearly complete.

**Likelihood Given Not H**: If the claim is false, the likelihood of observing this evidence is low (0.1). This is because it would be unlikely for a rigorous study to produce such strong results by chance alone.

**Evidence Weight**: The evidence weight is full (1.0) because the study was rigorous and the results were statistically significant.

**Evidence Quality**: The evidence quality is high (1.5) because the study was large, randomized, controlled, and published in a reputable journal. The results were statistically significant and the follow-up was nearly complete.

**Update Confidence**: The confidence in the update is high (0.9) because the evidence is strong and the likelihood assessments are based on rigorous reasoning.

**Bayes Factor Interpretation**: The Bayes factor is high, indicating that the evidence strongly supports the claim.


## Mathematical Specification
The analysis follows formal Bayesian updating:

1. **Bayes' Theorem**: P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)
2. **Bayes Factor**: BF = P(E|H) / P(E|¬H) = 9.0000
3. **Posterior Odds**: P(H|E) / P(¬H|E) = BF × P(H) / P(¬H)
4. **Evidence Weighting**: Effective BF = BF^(weight × quality)

## Bayesian Update Details
- **Prior Odds**: 1.0000
- **Posterior Odds**: 27.0000
- **Odds Ratio**: 27.0000
- **Log Bayes Factor**: 2.1972
- **Marginal Likelihood P(E)**: 0.5000

## Methodological Notes
- **Parameter Determination**: LLM-based assessment of Bayesian parameters
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Formal Bayesian updating with confidence bounds
- **Evidence Weighting**: Partial updating based on evidence quality and weight
- **Reproducibility**: Same methodology with potential parameter variation (like human analysts)
