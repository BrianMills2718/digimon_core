## Detailed Results

### 1. Information Value Assessment (Heuer's 4 Types)

**Purpose**: Categorize information by its diagnostic value for distinguishing between hypotheses.

**Key Findings**:
- Successfully categorizes information into 4 types: Diagnostic, Consistent, Anomalous, Irrelevant
- Processed 1000 information pieces in 0.01 seconds
- Correctly identifies diagnostic information as most valuable (value score: 1.0)
- Anomalous information flagged for hypothesis revision (value score: 0.8)

**Academic Applications**:
- Literature reviews: Prioritize sources that distinguish between theories
- Meta-analysis: Identify studies that discriminate between effects
- Theory development: Flag anomalous findings requiring new explanations

### 2. Stopping Rules for Information Collection

**Purpose**: Determine optimal stopping points for data collection.

**Key Findings**:
- Six stopping rules implemented: diminishing returns, confidence threshold, cost-benefit, time constraint, convergence, sufficient discrimination
- Multiple combination strategies (any, all, majority) for different contexts
- Prevented both premature stopping and over-collection in test scenarios

**Academic Applications**:
- Literature searches: Know when enough sources have been reviewed
- Data collection: Balance comprehensiveness with efficiency
- Grant proposals: Justify sample sizes and data collection plans

### 3. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)

**Purpose**: Systematic evaluation of multiple competing theories.

**Key Findings**:
- Successfully managed 50 hypotheses with 100 evidence pieces
- Bayesian probability updates working correctly
- Sensitivity analysis identifies critical evidence
- Handles contradictory evidence appropriately

**Academic Applications**:
- Theory comparison: Systematic evaluation of competing explanations
- Peer review: Structured assessment of alternative interpretations
- Research design: Identify most diagnostic experiments

### 4. Calibration System

**Purpose**: Assess and improve confidence accuracy in predictions.

**Key Findings**:
- Detected overconfidence of 22% in test scenario
- Brier score calculation working correctly
- Category-specific calibration tracking
- Processed 1000+ predictions efficiently

**Academic Applications**:
- Research planning: Accurate timeline and resource estimates
- Peer review: Calibrated confidence in critiques
- Grant writing: Realistic success probability assessment

### 5. Mental Model Auditing

**Purpose**: Detect and correct cognitive biases in analytical reasoning.

**Key Findings**:
- Detects 10 different cognitive biases
- Generates specific debiasing strategies
- Analyzed 100+ mental models in seconds
- Risk assessment correlates with bias severity

**Academic Applications**:
- Research design: Identify potential biases before data collection
- Peer review: Systematic bias checking
- Collaboration: Detect groupthink in research teams

## Performance Metrics

| Feature | Items Processed | Time | Rate |
|---------|----------------|------|------|
| Information Assessment | 1000 pieces | 0.01s | 100,000/sec |
| Stopping Rules | Real-time decisions | <1ms | N/A |
| ACH Competition | 50 hypotheses, 100 evidence | <1s | Real-time |
| Calibration | 1000 predictions | <1s | 1000+/sec |
| Mental Model Audit | 100 models | <5s | 20+/sec |

## Integration Recommendations

### Phase 2.1: Graph Analytics (T50-T60)
- Use ACH for theory comparison in network analysis
- Apply stopping rules to community detection iterations
- Information value assessment for edge importance

### Phase 2.2: Statistical Analysis (T61-T70)
- Calibration system for confidence intervals
- Mental model auditing for statistical assumptions
- Stopping rules for multiple testing corrections

### Phase 2.3: Machine Learning (T71-T80)
- ACH for model selection
- Calibration for prediction confidence
- Bias detection in feature selection

### Phase 2.4: Research Integration (T81-T90)
- Mental model auditing for peer review systems
- Information value for citation analysis
- Stopping rules for systematic reviews

## Edge Cases and Robustness

All systems successfully handled:
- Empty inputs
- Extreme values (0.01 and 0.99 confidence)
- Contradictory evidence
- Large-scale processing (1000+ items)
- Missing data

## Academic Impact

These IC-inspired features address critical challenges in academic research:

1. **Research Efficiency**: Stopping rules prevent both under-collection and over-collection of data
2. **Theory Development**: ACH provides systematic framework for theory comparison
3. **Bias Mitigation**: Mental model auditing catches cognitive biases before publication
4. **Quality Assessment**: Information value assessment improves source selection
5. **Confidence Accuracy**: Calibration system improves research planning and assessment

## Conclusion

The successful implementation and stress testing of these IC-inspired features demonstrates that KGAS can provide academic researchers with powerful analytical tools traditionally reserved for intelligence analysis. These features are:

- ✅ Fully functional with realistic academic scenarios
- ✅ Performant at scale
- ✅ Robust to edge cases
- ✅ Ready for integration into Phase 2 tools

The combination of these features with KGAS's existing graph analytics capabilities will create a uniquely powerful platform for academic research, bringing professional analytical rigor to scholarly investigation.
