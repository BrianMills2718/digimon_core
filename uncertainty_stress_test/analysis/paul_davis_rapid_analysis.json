The specific research is\nmore humble, using synthetic data and first versions of fusion methods. Both the information and\nthe fusion methods are subject to deep uncertainty. The information may also be fragmentary,\nindirect, soft, conflicting, and even deceptive. We developed a research prototype of an analyst-\ncentric fusion platform. This uses (1) causal computational models rooted in social science to\nrelate observable information about individuals to an estimate of the threat that the individual\nposes and (2) a battery of different methods to fuse across information reports. We account for\nuncertainties about the causal model, the information, and the fusion methods. We address\nstructural and parametric uncertainties, including uncertainties about the uncertainties, at\ndifferent levels of detail. We use a combination of (1) probabilistic and parametric methods, (2)\nalternative models, and (3) alternative fusion methods that include nonlinear algebraic\ncombination, Bayesian inference, and an entropy-maximizing approach. This paper focuses\nprimarily on dealing with deep uncertainty in multiple dimensions.\n1 Introduction\nThis paper has substantive and methodological purposes. Substantively, we describe basic\nresearch on using information fusion to assess whether individuals pose a terrorism threat.\nMethodologically, we illustrate how causal social-science models can be used as part of doing\nso. We also describe our analytical architecture for exploratory analysis under multi-dimensional\ndeep uncertainty.\nEarlier work reviewed technologies for using behavioral observations as part of threat\ndetection (Davis, Perry, Brown, Jeung, et al, 2013). A conclusion was that some of the\ntechnologies were promising, but magic bullets were unlikely and future success would probably\ndepend on greatly improving methods for information fusion. Unlike fusion in many domains,\nhowever, the information in question is mixed in character and often both complex and soft\u2014\ni.e., qualitative, subjective, fuzzy, or ambiguous. It is likely also to be uncertain, conflicting, and\nsometimes deliberately deceptive. Further, the underlying phenomena are more poorly\nunderstood than in physics problems. All of this motivated our current research, the report for\nwhich is in the publications process (Davis, et al., forthcoming).\nWe sought to build a prototype system that would fuse reports on an individual to be assessed\nas a possible terrorist threat. It should, we concluded:\n(1) Address matters probabilistically (how likely is it that the individual poses some degree\nof threat?);\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n2\n(2) Employ causal social-science models as part of the fusion;\n(3) Use a mixed-methods approach to span the range of reasonable causal relationships and\nfusion methods;\n(4) Have competitive streams of analysis because results depend on human imagination and\njudgment;\n(5) Design for routine exploratory analysis under deep uncertainty; and\n(6) Embody the system in a comprehensible analyst-centric computer platform that would\nfacilitate review, debate, and eventual sharing and re-use.\nWe focused on terrorism, but the research should be relevant to law enforcement, intelligence,\nand other domains. Our approach is very different from machine-driven mining of information\nfrom \u201cBig Data.\u201d\nSubsequent sections describe our analytical architecture, representation of heterogeneous\ninformation and related uncertainties, causal models, mix of fusion methods, creation of\nsynthetic data for testing, and implementation challenges. We end with illustrative results and\nconclusions.\n2 Top-Level Analytical Architecture\nFigure 1 shows the conceptual analytical architecture, which embodies the characteristics\nidentified above. When assessing an individual for the degree to which he poses a threat of\nterrorism, information derives from various sources as shown on the far left (1). It must be\n\u201cinterpreted\u201d to create the inputs needed for subsequent processing (2). The interpreted data then\nenters the several separate streams of analysis, with different causal models and variants (3).\nInformation result is then fused (4), drawing on an entire suite of methods and tools. The results,\nby method, are passed along for comparisons and for refinement of analysis with case-dependent\ntuning (5)-(6), This leads to results (7), which are also starting points for iteration with new\ninformation or the revisiting of old raw data (9). In the future, the analysis will also used to\nidentify priorities for obtaining new information to sharpen analysis (8).\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n3\nFigure 1. Top-Level System Vision\nAn important element (6) is labeled \u201cinterface model.\u201d This is where the analyst can change\nelements of the fusion process, perhaps to reflect different interpretations of the original raw data\nor to generate displays responsive to high-level questions that have to be mapped into the inputs\nof the fusion system. To illustrate, suppose that several \u201cstories\u201d are floating around in peoples\u2019\nheads about how to understand the information coming in. These might be akin to what a\ndetective novel might call different theories of the case. They may also stem from intuition or\nbiases, depending on perspective. If they are made explicit, then an \u201cinterface model\u201d can be\nwritten that says, e.g., \u201cIf we want to see things through the lens of story 1, then \u2026\u201d As indicated\nin Figure 2, this may affect some of the priors for Bayesian analysis, the form of some input\nprobability distributions, the way in which missing information is dealt with, and parameter\nsettings. It can also cause the analyst to look harder at some fusion methods than others. Much of\nthis corresponds to nontrivial 1:n mappings requiring knowledge, imagination, and artistry. We\nshould never imagine that such information fusion is a mechanical and objective process.\nFigure 2. How Different \u201cStories\u201d Can Affect Fusion\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n4\n3 Representing Heterogeneous Information\n3.1 Types of Information\nHeterogeneous information comes from different sources (e.g., detection devices, digital\nrecords, and human sources) and also varies in character. It can be complex and \u201csoft\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nqualitative, subjective, fuzzy, or ambiguous\u2014and also contradictory or even deceptive. Human\nsources sometimes lie, sometimes to curry favor and sometimes with malicious intent. Sensor\ndata and archival digital records can simply be wrong. Information can also be complex, as in\n\u201cHe is either a committed terrorist or a good-hearted na\u00eff in bad company where he acts as he is\nexpected to act in that group. I\u2019m not sure which\u201d (resulting in a bimodal probability\ndistribution). Another example would be \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether his motivation for the cause is\nhigh or very high, but it\u2019s up there.\u201d\nThe problems of dealing with complex information have been discussed for decades, some of\nit debating about Bayesian, Dempster-Shafer, Possibility Theory, Dezert-Smarandache Theory,\nand other methods; some of it in connection with \u201cfuzzy mathematics.\u201d We constructed a lengthy\nlist of complex information types to challenge ourselves. We found that we could represent all\nthe classes of complex information with the methods that we adopted. These included (1) going\nbeyond binary thinking; (2) using probability distributions for report data; (3) using causal\nmodels; (4) using fusion methods that allow inequalities and either promote convergence or\npreserve distinctions, depending on context; (5) representing qualitative variables on a common\n0 to 10 scale (or its discrete version {1.3.5.7.9}); and (6) characterizing the credibility and\nsalience of information elements. In principle, these can also be achieved with a more complex\nBayesian-network approach.\n3.2 Representing Uncertainty\nRepresenting uncertainty was a major issue. We had to deal with model uncertainty\n(structural uncertainty) and parametric uncertainty. These, however, appeared in numerous\nplaces as indicated by Table 1. We had various causal models, fusion methods, and ways to\ncombine them (a meta-model of fusion). Even when dealing with structural uncertainty, we also\nhad parametric choices. And, as discussed in Figures 1 and 2, we needed some models of our\ndata to deal with higher-level issues and questions.\nWe used a variety of methods to deal with uncertainty (Table 2) and were careful to maintain\ndistinctions between source data and methods used. Multiple methods were applied for each\nuncertainty type: we varied parameter values; we employed probability distributions, both for\nrepresenting gaps in knowledge and effects of random processes; and we used combinations. We\nused alternative causal and fusion models. And, finally, we used interface models. Other authors\nhave encountered the same issues and made some of the same distinctions (Walker, Lempert, and\nKwakkel; Bankes, Lempert, and Popper, 2005), but it did appear that we had more than usual\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n5\ncomplexity. This was because we had no constraints\u2014no sponsor insisting that we worry about\nonly some uncertainties. We also wanted to make the various choices easy for an analyst to\nadjust, which can be difficult with other methods for exploratory analysis.\nTable 1.

Both can be represented by probability distributions, but\nthey are different and the differences matter. This was a continuing source of confusion because\nmany researchers refer to both classes in terms of random variables without noting subtleties\ninvolved (e.g., the need to use mixture distributions for some of the work).\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n6\nTable 2.

For example, he might have military expertise\nwith explosives and a high degree of interest in radical Islamic philosophy. To use available\ninformation, we needed a causal model rooted in social science to represent causal factors and\ntheir effects.\nAn earlier review of scholarly social science bearing on terrorism synthesized in terms of\neasy-to-understand \u201cfactor trees\u201d identifying the factors contributing in a causal way to terrorism\nand public support thereof (Davis and Cragin 2009). Factor trees are \u201cthinking models\u201d to\nstructure reasoning and discussion. Case studies were then conducted to test or \u201cvalidate\u201d a\nparticular factor tree, that for public support of terrorism. This factor tree (Figure 3) held up well\nas a general qualitative theory with myriad context-specific specializations (Davis, Larson, et al.,\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n7\n2012). The study discussed what \u201cvalidation\u201d does and does not mean in such work, a matter of\ninterest to all concerned with deep uncertainty. It is one thing to validate that a model has\ncaptured the right factors; it is quite another to predict combined consequences.\nThe first point from Figure 3 is that a given higher level factor such as motivation can have\nmany sources: religious zealotry is one, but so also the sources may be a sense of identity, a\ndesire for glory and excitement, or a sense of duty. Recognizing such multiple causes changes\ndiscussion from arguing about which single cause is correct to something more realistic. The\nsecond point is that factor tree use \u201c~ands\u201d to indicate that, to a first approximation, where all of\nthe contributing factors need to be present if the factor to which they contribute is to be\nsignificant. They use \u201cors\u201d to indicate where any or all of contributing factors may be sufficient\nto create the higher-level factor (i.e., where the contributing factors are substitutable).\nFigure 3 is a multi-resolution model (MRM) (Davis 2003): one can specify inputs at the top\nlevel, at the level with four main factors, at the next more detailed level, etc. Making such\nrelationships explicit is very helpful conceptually and also for empirical analysis. In empirical\nwork, whether using real-world or model-generated data, higher level factors are good theory-\ninformed abstractions. Those\u2014not simple-hypothesis variables\u2014should often be the core of\nmultivariate regression.\nFactor trees are qualitative, but it proved possible subsequently to build a computational\nmodel based on the factor tree of Figure 3. This was an unusual computational model, however.\nIt was developed exclusively for exploratory analysis under deep uncertainty, rather than making\nbest-estimate predictions (Davis and O'Mahony 2013).\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n8\nFigure 3: A Factor Tree for Public Support of Insurgency and Terrorism\nFor the present work we extended the Davis-O\u2019Mahony methods to develop the Propensity\nfor Terrorism (PFT) model, a truncated version of which is shown in Figure 4. It depicts the\nfactors influencing an individual\u2019s propensity to commit terrorism, and, thus, the threat posed by\nthe individual. Although not separately validated by social-science research, it builds on the\nearlier work and seemed as a reasonably credible example. We used only the top layer that\nasserts that the threat T posed by an individual is a function of that individual\u2019s motivation (M),\nperception of terrorism\u2019s legitimacy (L), capability-opportunity (CO), and acceptability of costs\n(A). These inputs can be informed by observations or inferences about the lower-level factors in\nthe tree, or by interpreting other data that might not connect straightforwardly to the causal\nmodel. This would include using statistical information to inform base rates.\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n9\nFigure 4. A Truncated Factor Tree of Propensity for Terrorism\n.\nWe defined M, L, CO, and A so as to make them essentially independent, both logically and\nprobabilistically. This depends, however, on the model being used with data that has been\nproperly interpreted. Thus, we allow, by exception, for explicit correlations to be specified. For\nexample, if a given human source does not understand the model\u2019s difference between\nmotivation for a cause and a sense of legitimacy in using terrorism tactics, then he may report M\nand L as the same. Thus, his inputs on M and L would not be independent.\nThe PFT model is deliberately not that of a rational actor doing cost-benefit calculations.\nReal individuals are affected by emotions, cognitive biases, and other non-rational\nconsiderations. Further, they may not even have stable utility functions, instead \u201cdiscovering\u201d\ntheir values as matters develop, rather as with \u201cwicked problems\u201d in the policy domain. Such\nissues are discussed, with pointers to the literature, in a recent National Academy report about\ndeterrence (National Research Council 2014, 35ff) to which one of us (Davis) contributed.\nBriefly, some technical elements of the PFT model are as follows.\nWe define the factors (variables) on an interval scale of 0 to 10, often using the discretized\nscale of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 with equally spaced values corresponding to very low, low, medium,\nhigh, very high.\nAlthough we don\u2019t know the potentially complex actual functions describing the combined\neffects at each node of a factor tree, we find that much can be accomplished with a\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n10\ncombination of two building-block functional forms that more or less bound ways to\nrepresent nonlinear effects. We call them Thresholded Linear Weighted Sums (TLWS) and\nPrimary Factors (PF).\nThe TLWS method is akin to ordinary linear weighted sums, but it sets the result to 0 unless\neach of the contributing variables exceeds its threshold. This addresses a number of practical\nnonlinearities in a simple way. For example, if someone will very likely not become a\nterrorist unless he is willing to accept associated costs and risks, then there is some threshold\nlevel constituting \u201cenough\u201d acceptance.\nThe Primary Factors (PF) method states that the result is determined by the largest of the\ncontributing factors, or that plus a minor upward adjustment reflecting the next-biggest. For\nexample, an individual might have numerous sources of motivation, but the strength of his\nmotivation might be largely dictated by the biggest single one (e.g., extremist religion or a\nlove of danger and violence).\nWe developed the model (and the larger platform) with the Analytica\u00ae modeling platform. It\nuses visual modeling that is largely understandable to people who are not \u201creal\u201d\nprogrammers. Also, its modeling paradigm is closely related to the natural mathematics of\nthe problem: it exploits array mathematics, which makes multi-dimensional exploratory\nanalysis easy. Creating multidimensional visual displays requires more effort, as everyone\nwho does deep-uncertainty work. Figure 5 is one display that we have found comprehensible.\nIt was constructed in Excel with Analytica output. It shows results by color or number of a\ncell, as a function of five parameters X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5.\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n11\nFigure 5 An Illustrative Output of Exploratory Analysis\n5 A Mixed-Methods Battery of Fusion Methods\nWe needed alternative fusion methods. We drew on the classic literature on basic information\ntheory (Jaynes and Bretthorst, 2003), Bayesian analysis (Gelman and Shalizi 2010), Dempster-\nShafer theory (Shafer 1976), and Dezert Smarandache theory (Smarandache and Dezert 2009a;\nSmarandache and Dezert 2009b), Bayesian networks (Pearl, 2009), and several others as\nsurveyed in our earlier work (Davis, Perry, et al., 2013). We also drew on the literature on expert\nforecasts and judgment (Clement and Winkler, 2007).\nWe considered four types of fusion method: (a) purely subjective, (b) nonlinear algebraic, (c)\nquasi-Bayesian, and (d) a new entropy maximizing method (MEMP). All of these required\nadaptation or new work. Our nonlinear algebraic methods use the TLWS and PF methods\ndiscussed earlier. Our quasi-Bayesian method is \u201cquasi\u201d because we used heuristic methods to\ndetermine the weight given to different evidence and our model does not represent the full set of\nrelationships and likelihoods.1 We also constructed alternative \u201cgeneric\u201d likelihood functions and\nroutinely show results for all of them because the \u201creal\u201d likelihood function is often unknowable.\nFinally, the ME/MP method comes from the perspective of information-theory entropy and uses\nmethods from the machine-learning literature, such as those on regularization (see Davis, et al.\n1 Bayesian-network approaches can use more complex relationships. These require uncertain parameterization of\nlikelihood functions and management of the resulting uncertainty. Potential problems include false precision and\nsystematic model errors (Small and Fishbeck, 1999), which can be much worse than the problems from our\nsimplifications. Using such models correctly can also be computationally intractable or at least very difficult.\nX1\nX2\nX3\nX4\nX4\nX5\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n12\nforthcoming for citations). Technically, the approach uses nonlinear programming for fusion. It\nmaximizes an objective function that includes a weighted sum of entropy-maximization terms\nand terms minimizing contradictions with reports, such as a claim that a person\u2019s motivation is in\nthe medium-to-high range, but no lower or higher. The method yields estimates of threat level\nthat are as conservative (i.e., uncertain, in an information-theoretic sense) as possible given what\nhas been reported, but with recognition that the reports\u2019 assertions may not be correct.\nTable 3 summarizes the methods. Since our information fusion involves multiple steps, we\ndistinguish between (1) combining factors to estimate threat T and (2) fusing across reports,\nwhether to improve the estimate of factors M, L, CO, and A, or to fuse the reports\u2019 separate\nestimates of T.\nTable 3 Mixed Fusion Methods\nCombine factors to\ngenerate T for a given\nreport\nFuse threat\nestimates across\nreports\nFuse factors\nacross reports\nCombine refined\nfactors to generate\nT\nLinear weighted sums\n(LWS)\nLinear weighted\nsums (LWS)\nLinear weighted\nsums (LWS)\nLinear weighted\nsums (LWS)\nThresholded linear\nweighted sums (TLWS)\nThresholded linear\nweighted sums\n(TLWS)\nThresholded\nlinear weighted\nsums (TLWS)\nThresholded linear\nweighted sums\n(TLWS)\nPrimary factors (PF) Primary factors\n(PF)\nPrimary factors\n(PF)\nPrimary factors (PF)\nMaximum\nentropy/minimum\npenalty (MEMP)\nMaximum\nentropy/minimum\npenalty (MEMP)\nMaximum\nentropy/minimum\npenalty (MEMP)\nMaximum\nentropy/minimum\npenalty (MEMP)\nQuasi-Bayes Quasi-Bayes\nNote: Although methods are mostly the same for all columns, inputs and outputs are context dependent.\n6 Data\nThe results of even the most sophisticated analysis are limited by the data itself. We were\ndoing research, not developing an application program. What should we use for data? It would\nhave been a major effort to obtain \u201creal\u201d data and, had we done so, it might well have been\nclassified or trivialized. More important scientifically, the data would not have really tested our\nplatform adequately because the data would be whatever happened to be available. We instead\ncreated synthetic data to pose numerous challenges for our methods and platform\u2014challenges\nthat we had identified early, such as dealing with ambiguities in information (e.g., bimodal inputs\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n13\ncorresponding to equivocation), contradictions, even possible deception. We also designed cases\nthat we suspected would show differences among methods.\nThis synthetic data took the form of narrative vignettes, followed by synthetic versions of\nanalyst interpretations of raw data.\nHere we give merely one short example, a single report from a human agent, Agent B, about\nan individual, Harry Smith, who is under scrutiny.\nAgent B\nHarry talks big and seems to see no problem at all with violence, even terrorist\nviolence, in support of the group\u2019s objectives. I have to take that seriously,\nalthough he might be just \u201ctalking big.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how motivated Harry is to participate in the Slammers\u2019 activity\nand from my position in the club membership I do not know if he would be\nprovided with means and tools to participate in a violent act if he should choose\nto do so. Interestingly, I did hear comments that suggest Harry is nonetheless\ndubious about paying the cost and taking the risks associated with violent\naction\u2014even though he has endorsed violence as a legitimate route to right\nsociety\u2019s wrongs.\nFrom my vantage point, Harry does not appear to be a threat\u2014he likes to talk\nbig about the need for bringing down the system, but never wants to actually do\nanything other than talk. The few times he\u2019s been pushed he always comes up\nwith some excuse about taking care of some pressing need.\nSuch narrative information must be \u201cinterpreted\u201d in terms of probability distributions for\nHarry\u2019s motivation, sense of legitimacy, capability, and willingness to accept costs and risks (M,\nL, CO, and A). Those become the inputs for the analysis.\n7 Designing and Implementing a Platform for Exploratory Analysis\nImplementing the concept of Figure 1 involved more detailed design and some advanced\nprogramming. The initial version of the platform was much more procedural and\nstraightforward\u2014something an analyst who was not a programming expert could understand\nwithin days or a few weeks. That, however, hard-wired many of the choices we saw as\nimportant. Thus, we redesigned to achieve the flexibilities discussed earlier in connection with\nFigure 1. This involved tradeoffs. To our biased eyes, the design seems elegant, reviewable, and\nmaintainable while maintaining the uncertainty information. That is so, however, only for those\nwho have paid the price of a steeper learning curve than is required for more usual programming.\nAs an example, a significant meta-method issue is whether to combine the probability\ndistributions for factors M, L, CO, and A for each report to generate a threat estimate T, and then\nfuse those T estimates across reports, or to fuse factors across reports to improve the estimated\ndistributions for M, L, CO, and A, and then combine to estimate T. A number of such choices\nexist and\u2014lacking settled theory and solid data\u2014no a priori reason exists for believing that one\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n14\nis \u201cright.\u201d The best choice depends on the individual case and its data. This is analogous to\nempirical statistical analysis where data-cleaning and model choice are often justified\nheuristically on a case-by-case basis.\nOne way to think about the structural issues around which we had to design is to think of the\nmeta-level fusion as performed by operators as indicated in Figure 6. We have to operate on the\ndata to map the raw data into the inputs of the platform; we have to assign the data to each of the\nstreams; we have to decide on what order we process reports; we have to decide on when and\nhow to combine and fuse; and we have to decide on when to fuse across reports rather than\nstreams. Some of these operators don\u2019t commute. The answers are different if we combine first\nrather than fuse first, etc.\nFigure 6. Operators Employed in the Information Fusion\nThe resulting dimensionality is suggested by Table 5, which shows choices available for four\nof the structural issues and Table 5, which discusses data-grouping issues. The structural issues\nin Table 4 establish 48 analytical paths, each with uncertain parameters, as well as the choices\nindicated in Table 5. Exploratory analysis can generate tens of thousands of distinguishable\ncases, or more. It\u2019s best not to dwell on the number because it isn\u2019t conceptually important, or\neven computationally limiting at this stage, although applications of exploratory analysis benefit\nfrom supercomputers.\nTable 5: The Primary Dimensions of Structural Uncertainty\nStream and Model Combine or Fuse First?

At the visual-\nmodeling level we treated the stream and the combine/fuse order as explicitly distinct flows, as\nin the architecture of Figure 1. Where possible, we represented the various operators mentioned\nabove with functions. These functions have parameters to deal with structural issues and some\ndata-group issues. Analytica deals with all of this using array mathematics. The result is that the\nmathematics of the heterogeneous fusion can be expressed compactly. For example, the node at\nwhich threat estimates are to be fused across reports is defined as a table, as in Table 7. The\ndefinition specifies that all four fusion methods will be used, each with its own function. The\narguments specify on what data the functions are to operate. Thus, what appears to be a simple\ntable of functions is actually a table of functions with multidimensional arrays of probabilities as\ninputs and new multidimensional arrays of probabilities as outputs. The design allows more\nextensive and comprehensible exploratory analysis that explains what assumptions and choices\nare affecting results.\nTable 7.

It shows the probabilities, after fusion, for\nassigning an individual, Harry Smith, to one of three categories: threat, gray-area, or non-threat\n(corresponding to cumulative probabilities of T between 6 and 10, 4 to 6, and 0 to 4). Results are\nshown as a function of fusion method. The dashed lines indicate what the assessment was with\njust the initial information. The \u201cslicer bars\u201d at the top indicate major contributors to the result\nbeyond the choice of fusion method. For the example, in this particular projection of results, the\nTLWS method was used to estimate threat by combining factor values, Quasi-Bayesian fusion\nwas accomplished using a postulated \u201casymmetric\u201d likelihood function, and the reports were\nprocessed in the order received. Such parameter values can be changed interactively by clicking\nthrough their menus (note arrows). This is interactive exploratory analysis.\nWe see that in this fusion greatly increases the likelihood ascribed to Harry being a threat.\nThe primary factors method is extreme in this regard, as one would expect, but a rather striking\nresult is that the Bayesian method drops the estimate by a factor of 4 (0.28 to 0.07)! This doesn\u2019t\nexonerate Harry, but it strongly suggests that he is not a terrorist. But what if we used other\nfusion methods? Would we get the same answer? Not necessarily. Seeing discrepancies tells us\nto look more deeply into the particulars of Harry\u2019s case, perhaps all the way back to raw data.\nAfter doing so, we will probably be able to focus on one or two fusion method and refine the\ntuning. Again, however, this envisions an intelligent analyst-centric process, not an automated\nstatistical analysis.\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n18\nFigure 7: Illustrative Results from Prototype Experiments (not chosen for drama)\n8.2 Conclusions\nBy the end of our project, the methods were falling into place, the prototype analytical\nplatform was operating and we saw significant consequences of going about heterogeneous\nfusion in different ways. This was \u201cgood,\u201d not \u201cbad,\u201d because we had used the mixed-method\napproach precisely because we expected discrepancies and the need to look at the problem from\ndifferent perspectives. Follow-up analysis would be different depending on context. For\nexample, if we were desperately trying to find the most plausible suspect among a set of people,\nwe might \u201clook for trouble,\u201d choosing methods and tuning parameters accordingly. If instead we\nwere trying to objectively and dispassionately assess threat likelihoods, we would do something\nelse. And, finally, if we were second-guessing the decision to regard someone as a probable\nterrorist, we would look to find what formation elements were most critical in that assessment. If\none element had particularly high leverage, then we would scrutinize it in more detail and seek\nnew information to corroborate or disconfirm it. The result might be exoneration.\nDecision Making Under Deep Uncertainty 2015, Delft\n19\nWe conclude that such fusion methods have promise for increasing the probability of\ndetecting the rare potential terrorist, decreasing false alarms, and increasing the probability of\nexonerating individuals who might otherwise be falsely assessed. Much future work will be\nneeded, however, to determine actual value in real-world settings. We were merely establishing\nsome groundwork for next steps.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper is based on prior research sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and the Office\nof the Secretary of Defense.\nReferences\nClemen, Robert T., and Robert L.

        "Abstract\nThis paper discusses challenges for M&S if it is to be increasingly important to decision aiding and policy analysis. It suggests an approach that\u2014from the outset of a policy analysis project\u2014incorporates M&S of a varied resolution with the intent that (1) the results of analysis will be communicated with a relatively simple model and corresponding narrative that scans the system problem in breadth, having been informed by richer modeling, and (2) the broad view is supplemented by the selective detail (zooms) and selected change of the perspective as needed. This is not just a matter of \u201cdumbing down\u201d communication, but a matter of thinking about both forests and trees from the outset and about designing analytic tools accordingly. It will also enable exploratory analysis amidst uncertainty and disagreement, which is central to modern policy analysis and decision-aiding. All of this poses significant challenges for those who design and build M&S.\nKeywords:\nmodeling for policy analysis; multiresolution modeling (MRM); multiresolution; multiperspective modeling (MRMPM); multimodeling; families of models; base and lumped models; contextual abstraction; modeling and simulation; exploratory analysis; decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU); robust decision making (RDM); qualitative modeling",
        "1. Introduction\n1.1. Motivation\nOrganizations often use relatively complicated models and simulations (M&S) for research and to support planning. A recurring problem is that the models may appear to leaders to be incomprehensible and insufficiently responsive. This greatly undercuts their value, as occurred in 2011 when the U.S. Department of Defense dissolved a large modeling group [1]. In this paper, I suggest methods to improve the substantive quality of work while greatly mitigating communication problems. An admonition for analysts is\u2014from the outset\u2014to use multi-resolution, multi-perspective modeling (MRMPM) with relatively simple models for seeing forests and communicating to leaders, and with relatively more complicated models for understanding deeper issues, while noting the consequences of alternative perspectives [2] and avoiding blunders [3].\nSuch an MRMPM approach should also include human gaming and human-in-the-loop simulation, which illuminate matters obfuscated in usual computer modeling. When possible, a project should have a campaign plan for analysis that includes not only MRMPM, but a variety of such other sources of information as empirical analysis and discussion with experienced operators [4]. Further, it should confront the ubiquitous uncertainty and disagreement common to the wicked problems arising in policy analysis for complex systems [5]. The paper\u2019s suggestions are consistent with the themes of the movement for decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) [6].\n1.2. Terminology\nIn this paper (rather than the literature on computer graphics), multiresolution modeling (MRM) is \u201cbuilding a single model, a family of models, or both to describe the same phenomenon at different levels of resolution\u201d [7]. An earlier term was \u201cvariable resolution modeling\u201d [8,9]. MRM ordinarily involves families of models. MRMPM is similar except that the model family also represents alternative perspectives [7]. Although not discussed further here, a model\u2019s resolution can be quite different with regard to time, space, objects, object attributes, and processes [9,10].\nConsiderable work has been accomplished with multiresolution modeling [11] by one term or another, as with multilevel modeling in Rouse\u2019s work [12,13]. For example, Moon has discussed the often-puzzling relationships among abstraction, resolution, and fidelity [14]. Bettini, Jajodia, and Wang have discussed issues of time granularity in considerable detail [15]. Some have explored MRM issues in connection with the DEVS formalism for simulation [16,17]. In a recent work, Rabelo and colleagues reviewed MRM issues integrating live, virtual, and constructive simulations [10]. Hadi used MRM in a detailed guide for traffic planning [18]. Zeigler and co-authors discussed MRM in their third-edition M&S textbook [19]. As their text describes, complex systems have multiple components, each of which can be described by a base model and a lumped model that is an abstraction of the first. They discuss the criteria for consistency adequate for a specified purpose and context. See Chapters 15 and 22, which are an online lecture [20] and a short article relevant to defense work [21].\nThe alternative perspective aspect of MRMPM does not seem to have been much addressed in the literature, but it is related to the discussion of multifaceted modeling [19] and some of the literature on multimodels. A multimodel is a modular model with sub-models that together describe the behavior of a complex multi-phased system [11]. Multimodels reflect the common need for a variety of abstractions in and across applications [22]. Modeling alternative perspectives is especially important in the social sciences where many crucial issues involve values. Being able to generate the appropriate range of alternative perspectives may require diversity in the analytic team and organizational license to acknowledge such alternatives [2].\nAnother term worth discussing at the outset is \u201cvalidity.\u201d Although organizational leaders sometimes demand validated models, it makes no sense to talk about a model\u2019s validity in the abstract, a point emphasized long ago by Forrester and discussed in the textbook on system dynamics [23]. As recognized by the U.S. Department of Defense for decades, a model\u2019s validity should be assessed for a particular purpose in a particular context. Further, it is now recognized that \u201cvalidity\u201d should be seen as a multi-dimensional concept: a model\u2019s validity should be assessed separately for each of the following dimensions [24,25,26].\n(1) Description;\n(2) Cause\u2013effect explanation;\n(3) Postdiction;\n(4) Exploration;\n(5) Prediction.\nThe members of a multiresolution family will typically have very different realms of validity. For example, a machine-learning model may predict new data from the same stable system but will usually provide little or no cause\u2013effect explanatory power. In contrast, simulation models (e.g., system dynamic models) are often valuable for description, explanation, and/or exploration, but with little or no predictive power (if only because their input data are so uncertain).\nOther systematic discussions of validation take a different tack and focus more on means for assessing aspects of validity, notably testability, as in a paper that is careful in discussing the balance between simplicity and veridicality [27]. The U.S. Department of Defense, among other agencies, has an official article on the related issues of verification, validation, and accreditation [28]. Rouse discusses the many different functions of models in human-centric private- and public-sector applications. He touches upon assuring that a multilevel model is a good enough approximation for the application [29].\n1.3. Outline of What Follows\nWith this background, this concept paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 identifies ten major themes derived from my experience over the years. They do not purport to be tidy or the result of a formal and comprehensive literature review. Section 3 discusses a few past cases that tend to confirm the themes. Section 4 presents the conclusions, including some of the many challenges for those who develop M&S concepts, methods, and tools.\n2. Themes\n2.1. Analytic Support for Policy Analysis Should Provide Breadth, Selective Depth, and Selective Ability to Change Perspective\nBy and large, strategic decisionmakers need a top-down synoptic view of how their actions may affect the system. That is, they require breadth in the same way that a system designer needs a view of the whole. That said, some assessments and decisions depend on relatively detailed matters that cannot be taken for granted. Selectively, then, analytic support requires depth adequate to illuminate the troublesome issues. Similarly, analytic support should include the ability to discuss a problem area from selected different perspectives. The word \u201cselected\u201d is crucial because no study or study group can be comprehensive. Table 1 lists some of the many alternative ways one might represent a system. The intent is merely to illustrate that models for policy analysis may need to address such differing views.\nTable 1. Illustrative alternative perspectives for which modeling might be desired.\nTable\n2.2. Providing Breadth, Depth, and Variation Is Best Done with MRMPM Model Families\nIt follows that a project should plan for MRM and MRMPM from the start. This means having models that can accept inputs at different levels of detail, rather than \u201cselective viewing\u201d (generating lower resolution outputs upon demand using a single higher-resolution model) [8]. The need for this becomes manifest when we realize that higher-level reasoning\u2014ours as well as that of policymakers\u2014amounts to using a lower-resolution model. Doing so is essential for sense-making [7,8].\nIn some cases, a single model can zoom to a greater or lesser resolution (hierarchical variable resolution modeling or IHVR) [30]. More typically, we need different models for different resolutions and different perspectives. Ideally perhaps, we might develop family members jointly to understand how to relate them, i.e., how to aggregate, disaggregate, and map among them. Realistically, as with human families, the members of a family may develop over time without joint design and may not \u201cplay together\u201d well without expert adult supervision. A military example is the U.S. Air Force using both a mission-level model (Brawler) for air-to-air combat, including pilot styles and tactics, and a campaign-level model (STORM) in which air combat is much more aggregated. Only expert users can use the former to estimate the parameters sensibly for use in the latter, and then only for the context of a particular application [31]. An epidemiological example would be expert practitioners relating individual and population-level disease models [32].\nRepresenting alternative perspectives in a family of models is more unusual, except perhaps for using rotational coordinates as an alternative perspective in physics. As an example, options for an international agreement might be assessed by a probable effect on per-capita GDP or, instead, for effects on the structure of society and the health of the middle class. Otherwise, one analysis might purport to compare options by a weighted sum of scores, while another might rule out any option with bad effects on any of several considerations (e.g., the continued viability of a nation\u2019s fishing industry). Analysts can sometimes represent perspectives with different objective functions, perhaps with the non-linear weighting of criteria [33,34,35]. Nonlinearities often arise in strategic decision making because success may depend on all of a system\u2019s critical components possessing threshold levels of effectiveness or, e.g., because the political environment includes single-issue criteria that must be met.\n2.3. Useful Lower Resolution Models May Not Be Straightfoward Aggregations from More Detailed Model Isomorphic Relationships Are Not Required\nIn thinking about base and simple model pairs, as suggested by Zeigler [20], it is useful to distinguish between (1) lumping achieved by isomorphic aggregation from the base model\u2019s structure and (2) using a simplified model that mimics aggregate behavior adequately, but whose structure has no obvious relationship to the more detailed model. Aesthetically, the former has always seemed preferable, but the latter is common and important.\nSome may see it as natural to start with a relatively detailed model and then generate a lumped version by aggregating. This, however, often proves difficult, complex, and hard to understand. In contrast, simplified models may arise independently, e.g., by the empirical discovery of scaling laws, by intuitive leaps, or by heroic assumptions that someone familiar with details might be loath to make. Some examples familiar in both physical and social modeling involve linearity. There may be myriad reasons for aggregate behavior to be nonlinear, but linear approximations are often surprisingly good [36].\nAnother way to proceed is to start with a relatively simple model and add layers of detail to it as seems useful. This is apt to clarify morphisms between simple and more detailed models, but it may tend to oversimplify (and misrepresent) the more detailed phenomena. If one began with a simple rational, analytic economic model and then added detail, one might not postulate incorrectly a well-behaved and rational microlevel, rather than representing the more chaotic microscopic behavior of real systems (including actual human reasoning).\nInterestingly, we humans are superb at shifting seamlessly between simplifications as circumstances change (we hardly notice doing so), whereas models are often not so good at doing so. In military work, force ratio models proved remarkably useful for decades, but only by practitioners who would quickly adjust the force ratios depending on circumstances [37,38]. In epidemiology, SIR and SEIR models have long proven valuable, albeit with the necessary adaptations [39].\nThe theme here is that in generating a family of models, we should not hesitate to contemplate \u201csimple\u201d models that at first blush appear simplistic. Perhaps the data will demonstrate that they are better than expected and perhaps in-depth thinking will reveal why.\nAs an example of why this matters technically, consider that the approximate validity of lumpability is often said to depend on the approximate uniformity and indifference, as when all the agents of a system\u2019s components behave the same and do not affect each other in ways that distinguish among them. Consider, however, a model F(X, t) with a state vector X that may have 100 or 1000s of components, such as soldiers in combat. The soldiers have varied abilities and may variously fight singly or in groups with small or large groups of enemy soldiers. In other words, microscopic combat may not be uniform or indifferent. However, the overall outcome may be driven by only one or a few aggregate variables, such as the initial force ratio and perhaps a relative will to fight. Or, conversely, the aggregation of microscopic dynamics may not be so simple. The microscopic simulation may, near a tipping point of relative prowess, show a bifurcation into cases in which one or the other side wins decisively, rather than an outcome in which the sides mutually exhaust themselves into stalemate. This kind of trajectory splitting is common in the study of complex adaptive systems (CAS).\nUsing a COVID-19 example, individual-level sequences of infection, suffering, and recovering may vary across individuals and random events, but none of this may matter if sufficient mixing occurs. In contrast, if groups have different vulnerabilities and infection mechanisms, and do not mix very much, the disease may generate distinct populations. Averaging across populations may then be misleading. Na\u00efve analysis might expect the disease to die out in a month or two, whereas reality might see disease disappear in one group, persist longer in another, and then manifest itself in cycles of disease. The prediction of cycling was one of the \u201cwins\u201d in the modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such cycling is also not unusual in the modeling of complex or complex adaptive systems [23,40].\n2.4. Within a Family, Models Should Be Cross-Calibrated for Mutual Consistency\nA long-standing myth is that lower resolution models should be calibrated based on the runs of higher-resolution models. The myth may have been the result of analogies to physics where, e.g., classical thermodynamics can be derived from statistical mechanics, which can in turn be derived from quantum statistical mechanics. When drawing that analogy, however, it is often not appreciated that the parameter values of aggregate phenomena are usually obtained empirically.\nThe upward calibration approach might make sense if the detailed models and data (see top of Figure 1) were accurate and certain. Unfortunately, in application areas (as distinct from the idealized universes of physics theory), models at different levels of detail are flawed and their input data are uncertain [41]. A better approach for the M&S community is to seek mutual consistency across all levels using all the available empirical data [42]. That is, the bottom depiction in Figure 1 is more appropriate for the military example used: information flows upward, downward, and sideways, connecting information at all levels.\nInformation 14 00134 g001 550\nFigure 1. Objective: achieving consistency across combat models of varied resolution.\nTo illustrate significance, consider that many detailed models, coupled with their databases, predict aggregate system behaviors that are far more efficient than real-world aggregate empirical data. Often, the detailed models lack processes corresponding to frictions or inefficiencies. For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, many models had predicted a quick victory. They did not allow for such factors as the relative will-to-fight of combatants, the relative prowess of the sides\u2019 generals, and systemic corruption affecting many aspects of the Russian army\u2019s quality.\nAs a second example, some early models of the COVID-19 pandemic assumed rational behavior on the part of populations, such as a quick and full acceptance of vaccines. Even if they had a parameter for vaccine hesitation (as did the influential Imperial College London model of the COVID-19 pandemic [43]), the model did not anticipate vaccine resistance correlating to political schisms and tribalism.\nThe idealized notion of upward calibration from a definitive detailed model to simpler aggregate models has always been misguided, even as an idealization. It may be a zombie idea, meaning it is one that will rise again and again.\n2.5. Motivated Meta-Modeling Can Help with Cross-Calibration and Data Analysis\nOperations researchers have long used response surfaces or meta models, often simple analytical expressions that predict approximately the same outcomes as a more complicated model regarded as authoritative. Such models, however, often provide no conceptual music. They are just regressions with various mysterious terms and coefficients.\nA more attractive approach is to think about what simplified behavior might look like based on plausible but perhaps heroic assumptions, such as integrals being approximated by a representative value of the integrand times the width of the integration domain, a single chemical or social process dominating the problem, economically rational behavior, exponential decay of some property, or steady-state circumstances. If the resulting analytic expression makes sense dimensionally and conceptually, then the result can be tested against empirical data or against systematic runs of a more authoritative model. Perhaps the simplified model explains results well, albeit with an empirical multiplier and an empirical error term; if so, then the simplified model also provides the rough causal explanation that is so crucial to narrative and communication.\nA premier example which has emerged over the decades is the radar equation (discussed in many places, including Wikipedia). Such a formula model can be used to specify elements of a regression, which is far better than merely having some coefficient values for a regression that seems to fit extant data for unknown reasons. James Bigelow and I called this approach motivated metamodeling [44]. When introducing the approach, we assumed that it was common. Instead, it seems uncommon, especially by data-driven analysts who talk about \u201cletting the data speak\u201d or those wedded to detailed models. Motivated metamodeling could be a routine element of policy analysis projects connecting models and data. I note that testing a motivated metamodel in no way corrupts analysis as data-driven researchers sometimes claim; if the postulated form is not roughly right, the corresponding coefficient will turn out to be small (the postulate will have been falsified). In contrast, even though users may think that they are allowing \u201cdata to speak,\u201d typical regression analysis imposes the assumption of linearity (or of a polynomial structure).\n2.6. The Capacity for Exploratory Analysis under Uncertainty Needs to Be Built in from the Outset\nAlmost everyone agrees on the need for sensitivity analysis or even its cousin on steroids, exploratory analysis, that explores outcomes as all the important and uncertain parameters of a problem are varied simultaneously. In practice, however, studies usually do far less ambitious uncertainty analysis than intended, in significant part because it is difficult and tedious unless the groundwork has been laid from the outset in the modeling, programming, and analytical tools.\nThe methods for exploratory analysis and support for robust decision making (RDM) are hallmarks of considerable research in recent decades, associated with decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) [4,6,45,46,47,48,49,50]. Such analysis is still the exception rather than the rule, but that should change. So the questions asked of models should also change; rather than asking \u201cWhat if?\u201d and running a simulation, we should routinely be asking \u201cUnder what circumstances and assumptions will this strategy succeed or fail\u201d [51]? This is especially true in competitive domains, such as defense planning or commercial battles for market share, but it is true also in planning to avoid environmental and other disasters.\n2.7. Modular Rather Than Monolithic Models Should Be the Rule\nOrganizations often focus on a single premier model as authoritative, usually a complex and monolithic model. Often, however, good analysis benefits from leaner, agile, and tailored work. Monolithic models do not lend themselves readily to this.\nIndividual groups develop model families that they learn to work with, but this usually requires a cadre with deep expertise and craft knowledge. Examples include the family of high-resolution simulations used by Matsumura, Steeb, and Herbert, and the work in several military service analytic teams such as the Air Force A-9. Some research groups have composed models for analysis that use agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and social science methods [52]. Some are taking a more modular approach to enterprise-level analysis, as described by Gallagher and colleagues [53].\n2.8. Qualitative Models Can Be Structure and Subtantive\nAlthough most members of the M&S community focus on quantitative applications, policy analysis typically involves the social sciences in which qualitative research is often particularly insightful. A project considering a family of models should not hesitate to address qualitative issues, especially since qualitative modeling can add significantly to the coherence of the work. One of the contributions qualitative modeling can make is to combine what otherwise might be carried along as competing social science theories that merely pass in the night without unification. More unifying qualitative theories may be highly structured, based on solid social science, and made quantitative for limited mathematical purposes (e.g., by the use of subjective Likert scales).\n2.9. Interface Models\nSometimes it is necessary to build an \u201cinterface model\u201d that maps the questions of policy analysis (sometimes questions from policymakers themselves) into the variables of an existing model. The policy questions often reflect perspectives different from those of model builders. Some examples are;"

AI should help participants in wargames, and agents in simulations, to\nunderstand possible perspectives, perceptions, and calculations of adversaries who are operating with uncertainties and\nmisimpressions. The content of AI should recognize the risks of escalation leading to catastrophe with no winner but\nalso the possibility of outcomes with meaningful winners and losers. We discuss implications for the design and develop-\nment of families of models, simulations, and wargames using several types of AI functionality. We also discuss decision\naids for wargaming, with and without AI, informed by theory and exploratory work using simulation, history, and earlier\nwargaming.\nKeywords\nArtificial intelligence, wargaming, modeling and simulation, cognitive modeling, decision-making, decision-making under\ndeep uncertainty, massive scenario generation, exploratory analysis and modeling\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper, we argue that (1) modeling, simulation,\nand wargaming (MSG) are related methods of inquiry\nthat should be used together, that (2) artificial intelli-\ngence (AI) can contribute to each, and that (3) AI for\nwargaming should be informed by modeling and simula-\ntion (M&S) while AI for M&S should be informed by\nwargaming. We sketch an approach, focusing for brevity\non political-military MSG involving states with weapons\nof mass destruction (WMD) and other high-end weap-\nons. Section 2 provides our view of how MSG and anal-\nysis can relate to each other. Section 3 shows that this is\nfeasible by discussing a 1980s system. Section 4 notes\ntoday\u2019s challenges and opportunities. Section 5 sketches\naspects of architecture. Section 6 highlights the selected\nchallenges in developing AI models and decision aids.\nSection 7 draws conclusions. Throughout the paper, we\nuse \u2018\u2018model\u2019\u2019 to cover the range from simple math for-\nmulas or logic tables to complicated computational mod-\nels; we use \u2018\u2018wargame\u2019\u2019 to include everything from\nsmall seminar exercises (e.g. Day-After exercises 1 ) to\nlarge multi-day, multi-team wargames.\n2. An integrated view of modeling,\nsimulation, gaming, and analysis\nMSG can be used for a wide range of functions, such as\nthose in Table 1. Each function can be addressed by each\nMSG element, although relatively simple human activities\nsuch as seminar wargames and Day-After Exercises have\nproven uniquely valuable for the last two items.\nThe usual forms of M&S and wargaming have different\nstrengths and weaknesses2\u20136 as stereotyped in the first\nthree columns of Table 2. M&S is seen as quantitative, rig-\norous, and \u2018\u2018authoritative,\u2019\u2019 but severely limited for failure\nto reflect human considerations. Critics of M&S go farther,\narguing that the \u2018\u2018rigor\u2019\u2019 of M&S translates into generating\n1\nRAND Corporation and Pardee RAND Graduate School, USA\n2\nYale University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nPaul K Davis, RAND Corporation and Pardee RAND Graduate School,\n1776 Main Street, Santa Monica, CA 90407-21391, USA.\nEmail: pdavis@rand.org\nresults that may be precise, but wrong. Wargaming, in\ntheir view, corrects for the shortcomings of M&S. M&S\nadvocates have a different view.\nWe assuredly recognize and have long criticized the\nshortcomings of normal modeling. We have also benefited\ngreatly from wargaming, in part through long associations\nwith Herman Kahn (P.B.), RAND, and Andrew Marshall,\nbut the quality of wargames ranges from being a waste of\ntime or even counterproductive to being a rich source of\ninsights. Although such insights cannot be trusted without\nfollow-up study, that is true also of insights from modeling.7\nA thesis of our paper is that the stereotype need not be\ncorrect and that the aspiration (unabashedly lofty) should\nbe for the last column of Table 2\u2014\u2018\u2018having it all\u2019\u2019 with a\nsemi-integrated mix of modeling, simulation, and gaming.\nFigure 1 shows a corresponding vision.\nThis idealized activity over time begins (Item 1) by\nassembling knowledge about a domain (e.g. international\nsecurity issues for the India-Pacific region) from studies,\nwar games, military and diplomatic experience, human\nhistory, anthropology, and so on. Metaphorically, this is\ncharacterizing the chessboard, actors, potential strategies,\nand rule book.\nTwo efforts proceed asynchronously. As in the upper\nhalf of Figure 1, wargaming proceeds, structured for some\npurpose. This may occur independently, whether or not\nTable 1.

In paral-\nlel, M&S proceeds in the form of game-structured simula-\ntion. Over time, the lessons from M&S and wargaming are\nassimilated using AI to mine data from M&S experiments\n(Item 4), so as to refine theory and data for subsequent\ncycles (Item 5). At any given time, problem-tailored MSG\naddresses real-world problems (Item 7). As in the light-\ngray bubbles, decision aids for human teams (Item 6a) and\nheuristic rules for agents (Item 6b) are generated and\nupdated. Some are constructed directly, but others distill\nknowledge from analytic experiments and wargaming.\nSome agents incorporate AI directly, some indirectly, and\nsome not at all. Figure 1 encourages coordination among\nMSG activities, although the coordination may sometimes\nbe informal and might occur only occasionally.\nThe intent of Figure 1 could be accomplished in a sin-\ngle organization (e.g. for sensitive in-government work)\nand/or a more open continuing program of efforts in think\ntanks, laboratories, private industry, academia, and gov-\nernment, as in Figure 2\u2014in what a DARPA study called a\nsocial-behavioral modeling laboratory (SBML).8 In either\ncase, the approach would encourage diversity, debate, and\nFigure 1. Connecting M&S, wargaming, and analysis.\nFigure 2. A virtual social-behavioral modeling laboratory (SBML) (taken from a recent study8 ).\nDavis and Bracken 3\ncompetition. It would also encourage composing purpose-\nbuilt MSG components using community modules. This\ncontrasts with focusing on one or a few blessed, mono-\nlithic models. Bluntly, the vision is revolutionary.\n3. Existence proof\nAn inspiration for the vision of Figure 1 was the RAND\nStrategy Assessment System (RSAS) of the 1980s\n(Appendix 1 points to documentation). In response to a\nDoD request for better use of wargaming for strategic\nanalysis, an RAND team led by Carl Builder proposed\nautomated wargaming that would exploit that era\u2019s AI,\nexpert systems, but that would allow interchangeable AI\nmodels and human teams.9 That led to a multi-year proj-\nect, which one of us (P.K.D.) led after joining RAND in\n1981.\nThe project began with an in-depth design, which\nretained the seminal idea of interchangeable teams and AI\nagents, but also included a flexible global military model;\nnew AI-related concepts such as alternative Red and Blue\nagents, each with models of each other; a Green Agent\nrepresenting other parties with simple parameterized rule-\nbased submodels; the capacity for Red and Blue agents to\ndo \u2018\u2018look-aheads\u2019\u2019 before making decisions; and \u2018\u2018analytic\nwar plans\u2019\u2019\u2014adaptive slotted-script AI models represent-\ning military commanders. The design also anticipated:\nmultiscenario analysis, incorporating \u2018\u2018soft factors\u2019\u2019 such\nas qualitative fighting effectiveness, and explanation capa-\nbility for the AI models. Figure 3 sketches the high-level\nRSAS architecture.10 Implementation proceeded through-\nout the 1980s. RAND used the RSAS for DoD studies, for\nexample, of the conventional balance in Europe and pro-\nposals for conventional arms control,11,12 and exported it\nto various government offices and war colleges. The Joint\nStaff received the RSAS, but continuity proved impractical\nbecause as soon as appropriately talented officers learned\nto use it, they were promoted to other assignments.\nDespite its technical successes, the RSAS was ahead of\nits time in some ways. On one hand, its innovative global\ncombat model was widely embraced and used for both\nanalysis and joint wargaming. It became the Joint\nIntegrated Combat Model (JICM), which has evolved over\nthe last 30 years and is still used. On the other hand, the\nAI portions of the RSAS were seldom used outside RAND\nexcept for demonstrations. Most government offices steer-\ning the RSAS work had no interest in political-level mat-\nters such as crisis-decision-making, paths to war, or\nescalation. A few were, which led to RAND studies,13\u201315\nbut for the most part their needs could be addressed by rel-\natively simple wargames, including the Day-After\nExercises (Roger Molander, Peter Wilson).16 Furthermore,\nthe full RSAS was expensive, complicated, and demand-\ning. More generally, DoD interest in wargaming plum-\nmeted with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nFortunately, cream-skimming proved possible: some of\nthe important insights from RSAS-like simulations with AI\nagents can be obtained with very simple models and\ngames,17\u201319 as illustrated recently in unpublished work gam-\ning nuclear war with alternative images of the adversary.20\nThe RSAS incorporated to some degree most of the\nideas of Table 2\u2019s last column, so it demonstrated feasibil-\nity. That is, it serves as an existence proof of sorts. That,\nhowever, was during the Cold War with 1980s technology.\nWhat could be done today?\n4. Challenges and opportunities\n4.1. National security challenges\nToday\u2019s international security challenges go well beyond\nthose of the Cold War.21 They cry out for fresh wargam-\ning22 and fresh M&S. The new challenges include the\nfollowing.\n4.1.1. Multi-polarity and proliferation. The world now has\nmultiple decision-making centers whose actions are inter-\ndependent. Conceptually, this places us in the world of\nn-person game theory. Unfortunately, it seems that the\nconvoluted solution concepts for n-person games have not\nyet proven terribly useful,23 although such phenomena as\nthe tragedy of the commons and the diner\u2019s dilemma can\nbe described in the language of n-person game theory, and\nmean-field theory can sometimes be useful as an approxi-\nmation. For various reasons, such solutions have not been\nwidely adopted. Business-school strategy courses rarely\nuse these techniques and defense think tanks seldom incor-\nporate them in their M&S. It may be that real-worldFigure 3. RSAS architecture.\n4 Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation: Applications, Methodology, Technology 00(0)\nmultipolarity is simply too complicated to model, although\na few efforts have been made relating to strategic stabi-\nlity.24 As with even the three-body problem in physics,\nbehavior in n-party systems can even be chaotic (as noted\nin Chinese science fiction by Liu25\n). We also note how\nsmall a role randomized mixed strategies usually play in\nn-person games. Again, there may be so much inherent\ncomplexity in calculating other players\u2019 moves that an\nadded layer of uncertainty arising from randomization\nwould contribute little to our understanding of future crisis\ndynamics.\nMore states have WMD than in the 1980s (i.e. India,\nPakistan, North Korea) and even more have weapons of\nmass disruption. The addition of cyber as a strategic\nweapon further complicates matters. Here, AI might be\nhelpful in understanding events. As an example, suppose a\nnuclear force is attacked by bringing down the electrical\npower system it uses for its electronic control (that may\nnot be easy because of dispersal and defenses). A missile\nforce can only perform for a short time on backup power\nsystems. The major powers are surely aware of this vul-\nnerability for themselves and their rivals. In the commer-\ncial electrical power world, AI is becoming important for\nrapid reallocation of power sources to demand nodes after\ndisruptions, such as occurred in Texas with state-wide\nfreezing temperatures in 2021.\n4.1.2. Multi-dimensional warfare. Changes of weaponry\nhave extended the dimensionality of high-end crisis and\nconflict, as with long-range precision strike and new forms\nof cyberwar, information warfare, and space warfare. This\nmeans that the 44-rung escalation ladder introduced long\nago by Kahn26,27 must now be replaced by something\nmore complex, as discussed later in section 6.3.\n4.1.3. Feasibility of limited strategic war. A corollary is under-\nappreciated, that the world is now more ripe than earlier\nfor limited high-end warfare in which\u2014despite assertions\nto the contrary by the more ardent enthusiasts for deter-\nrence theory\u2014there may be meaningful winners and losers.\nThis becomes evident when considering possibilities such\nas a Russian invasion of Baltic states, a North Korean inva-\nsion of South Korea, or Chinese aggression against Taiwan.\nSome of the issues that arise include Russia\u2019s dalliance with\na strategy of escalate-to-deescalate (a Russian version of\nNATO\u2019s Cold War strategy)28 and prospects for cyberwar\nand attacks on space systems. So also, it is troublesome to\nobserve more states deploying precision strike weapons\nwith transoceanic range. Even protracted \u2018\u2018limited\u2019\u2019 strate-\ngic war may now be possible, although escalation could\neasily occur as discussed in section 6.3.\n4.1.4. Conflicting objectives among allies and\npartners. Today\u2019s US security partners have different vital\ninterests and perceptions. The remarkable unity demon-\nstrated by NATO throughout the Cold War might not be\nreproduced in a modern crisis or conflict. In the Asia-\nPacific region, the ambivalent relationships among North\nand South Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan, India, and\nPakistan constitute an omen of difficulties in crisis.29 All\nof these nations have escalation options through use of\nspace, cyberspace, or regional-range precision weapons.\nThe overall issue here is that alliances are still very\nimportant, but today\u2019s alliances are likely to be different\nthan the taut blocks of the Cold War. We may be entering\na phase of multipolarity akin to that of the early 20th cen-\ntury. One factor in the outbreak of World War I was\nBerlin\u2019s belief that London would not join France in a war\nto block Germany in Europe. This led to the belief that\nwar would resemble the Franco-Prussian War of 1871\u2014\nlimited, short, and not particularly destructive. Even\nFrance was uncertain until August 1914 over whether\nBritain would join in. Such calculations as to what one\u2019s\nallies will do are critical to stability. Uncertainty here is\ntruly a strategic problem of enormous importance.\n4.2. Technological changes and opportunities\nNew technological opportunities abound when contemplat-\ning the prospect of modern analytic wargaming. The fol-\nlowing sections list a few.\n4.2.1. Agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling (ABM)\nhas progressed greatly and is especially important for gen-\nerative modeling that provides a cause\u2013effect understand-\ning of how phenomena unfold. Such generative modeling\nis a revolutionary development of modern science.30,31\nUnlike the agents of earlier expert systems, today\u2019s agents\nare typically goal-seeking or position-improving in nature,\nwhich may allow them to be more adaptive.\n4.2.2. AI. AI research more generally is, of course, far\nbroader than ABM. It provides limitless possibilities as\nlaid out in modern texts.32 We do not discuss it much in\nthis paper, but in contemplating the future of M&S, and of\ndecision aids for wargaming, it would be desirable to have\nlengthy sections on each of the types of AI sometimes\nidentified, that is, reactive machines, machines with lim-\nited memory, finite automata, machines with their own\ntheory of mind, and machines with self-awareness. That is\nnot possible here, a limitation that will perhaps be reme-\ndied by subsequent authors.\n4.2.3. Networking. Networking is now a core feature of\nmodern life with global connections among people, organi-\nzations, and even refrigerators. Data are ubiquitous.33 One\naspect of this is distributed wargaming and exercising.\nAnother is online gaming, even to the extent of massively\nDavis and Bracken 5\nparallel recreational games, study of which may yield\nnational-security insights. Such games are not intended to\nbe \u2018\u2018serious,\u2019\u2019 but behaviors observed in them may suggest\npossibilities and inclinations that would not be recognized\nin more academic study.34\n4.2.4. Modularity and purpose-built model composition. It\nnow makes sense to build models as independently useful\n(i.e. as modules) and to compose more complex structures\nas needed for the problem at hand. Such composition con-\ntrasts with DoD\u2019s historical preference for standardized\nlarge, integrated, monolithic models. Such standardization\nis much less attractive where uncertainties and disagree-\nments are common as in higher-level M&S or wargaming.\nModular designs permit carrying along alternative concep-\ntions of what is being modeled. This can open minds,\nwhich is useful for foresight, as with avoiding surprise or\npreparing for adaptation. It is also possible to routinely\ncompare alternative models to data, in part for routine\nupdating as suggested in Figure 2. Also, modular develop-\nment facilitates inserting specializations for a particular\nproblem, an approach recommended by the community of\nmodelers and analysts in a mid-2000s DoD workshop.35\n4.2.5. Data-driven AI/machine learning. The term AI is com-\nmonly used today to mean machine learning (ML), which\nis only one version of AI. ML has advanced substantially\nand ML models can often be accurate in fitting past data\nand finding otherwise unrecognized relationships. A\nreview describes progress but also notes limitations\u2014\nsuggesting theory-informed versions of ML that would be\nmore effective in future-oriented work and highlighting\nwhat is called adversarial AI, which includes tactics to\ndefeat the opponent\u2019s deep-learning algorithms.36\n4.2.6. Decision-making under deep uncertainty. Fundamental\nadvances have occurred in concepts and technology for plan-\nning, discussed under the rubric of decision-making under\ndeep uncertainty (DMDU). This moves away from efforts to\n\u2018\u2018optimize\u2019\u2019 for best-estimate assumptions toward strategies\nexpected to do well across a broad range of possible futures,\nthat is, across many uncertain assumptions. Whereas addres-\nsing uncertainty was often paralytic in the past, it need not\nbe so today. These insights and methods have a long history\nin defense planning37\u201339 and social policy analysis40,41 and\nshould be incorporated in AI and decision aids.\n4.2.7. Designing \u2018\u2018always-on\u2019\u2019 systems with increasing\nintelligence. Technically, most DoD MSGs have been what\nthe AI community calls \u2018\u2018transformational.\u2019\u2019 The model or\ngame has a starting point; it runs and then reports winner\nand loser. Multiple runs can be made and results aggre-\ngated to capture the variance inherent in complex\ndynamics. Newer AI models are designed differently,\nmodeling systems that are \u2018\u2018always on.\u2019\u2019 This is called\nreactive programming, as distinct from transformational\nprogramming. These systems never stop and do not just\ntransform input data to output data. Examples include ele-\nvator systems and computer operating systems. Defense\nexamples include a cyber warning system, a missile warn-\ning system, or an operations center. None of these go\n\u2018\u2018off.\u2019\u2019 Defense systems are becoming more reactive, and\nso must the models to represent them. This was foreseen\nby design of the higher-level Red and Blue Agents of the\n1980s RSAS, which would \u2018\u2018wake up\u2019\u2019 after events and\nassess the situation and options freshly, rather than con-\ntinuing to follow a script.14\nIn transformational models, events in the environment\nmay trigger the program to take an action sequentially.\nReactive models are different. Programs make concurrent\nchanges in the environment. They change together, or\nnearly together. One interesting example for defense work\ninvolves autonomous weapons. The line between human\nand machine decisions has blurred because the interactions\namong people and machines in a reactive system may be\ncontinuous and intertwined. Reactive systems are a main\nthrust of US, Chinese, and Russian defense investments.\nHow will drone swarms and cyber warning systems be\nrepresented in M&S and wargames? Unless the represen-\ntations are apt, the value of related AI models in simula-\ntion might be counterproductive.\nThis, however, is only the beginning. How will AI\nchange as machines have better memories and exploit what\nthey have learned, and as they incorporate theories of the\nworld, including theories of adversary mind?42 One worry\nis that increased use of AI will increase the prospect of rapid\nescalation, as discussed by Yuna Wong and colleagues.42\nThe risk of this is especially high for AI that focuses on\nmaximizing some relative quantitative measure, rather than\nmore absolute outcomes and the qualitative evaluation\nthereof. As an example from Cold War experience, analysis\nthat obsessed on who would \u2018\u2018win\u2019\u2019 a global nuclear war by\nemerging with a superior post-exchange ratio of nuclear\nweapons was dangerous.15 Fortunately, decision-makers\nunderstood that outcomes would be catastrophic with no\nmeaningful victor. Even the computer Joshua in the 1983\nmovie Wargames was wise enough to conclude \u2018\u2018Nuclear\nwar. A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.\nHow about a nice game of chess?\u2019\u2019 Whatever AI Joshua\nembodied, it was more than ML about how to win a recrea-\ntional game by the numbers.\n5. Toward architecture\n5.1. Functions sought\nDeveloping a full architecture for modern analytic war-\ngaming is beyond the scope of this paper, but suggesting\n6 Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation: Applications, Methodology, Technology 00(0)\nsome directions is possible. Figure 4 sketches a top-level\narchitecture and Table 3 suggests various features in more\ndetail. Figure 4 recognizes the need to address current-era\ncrisis and conflict with in-depth attention to at least three\nmajor actors when contemplating many possible crises\nand conflicts. One example might be North Korea, South\nKorea, the United States, and China. Figure 4 also calls\nfor a modular approach to the military simulation.\nTable 3.

Many other\nfeatures, however, should be quite different. We see Table\n3 as an opener for discussion, not an endpoint.\n5.2. Limitations of exploratory analysis amidst\nmassive uncertainty and disagreement\nSince preparing for massive scenario generation, explora-\ntory analysis, and decision-making under uncertainty is\nprominent in our discussion, two significant issues need\nhighlighting:\n\u2022 Exploratory analysis across parameter values is use-\nful only if the simulation is structurally valid (i.e.\nonly if the model itself is valid).47\n\u2022 Drawing conclusions from exploratory analysis can\nbe problematic when the cases (scenarios) exam-\nined are not equally probable, their probabilities are\ncorrelated, but no good basis exists for assigning\nprobability distributions.\n5.2.1. Model validation. As discussed elsewhere, model\nvalidity and data validity should be characterized sepa-\nrately for description, explanation, post-diction, explora-\ntion, and prediction.47,48 Also, they must be judged with\nrespect to the particular problem and context. Parametric\nmethods go a long way, but model uncertainty has often\ngotten short shrift and needs more attention as discussed\nin a recent article.49 Carrying along adversary models with\nvery different objectives and values is just one example of\ndoing so.\n5.2.2. Drawing conclusions from exploratory analysis. With\nrespect to the vexing problem of how to use exploratory\nanalysis without knowing the relative probability of the\ncases, we suggest that exploratory analysis is very likely\nto have value for at least the purposes illustrated in Table\n4, none of which require probabilities. For each example,\nthe purpose of the exploration is to find possibilities (e.g.\nvulnerabilities or opportunities) motivating measures to\nprevent them, anticipate them, or prepare for related adap-\ntations. If a critical vulnerability exists, it should be fixed,\nwhether the probability of it being exploited \u2018\u2018seems\u2019\u2019 to\nbe low or high (if its probability was known to be vanish-\ningly small, that would be a different matter).\n6. Decision aids and AI\nThis section discusses selected issues that arise in thinking\nabout AI and decision aids for modeling and wargaming.\nThe first discusses decision-aid functions. The next dis-\ncusses a challenge when envisioning using the ML version\nof AI to exploit massive scenario generation. The final sec-\ntion discusses one of the fundamental challenges involved\nin developing \u2018\u2018cognitive AI\u2019\u2019 and related decision aids.\n6.1. Decision aids for wargaming\n6.1.1. Generic functions. If we ask about the primary func-\ntion of decision aids based on what we see as important to\nFigure 4. N-party game-structured simulation.\n8 Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation: Applications, Methodology, Technology 00(0)\nplayers, rather than as exciting to AI providers, a number\nof key functions suggest themselves as in Table 5.50\nFrom science fiction, we might expect modern decision\naids for gaming to be highly computerized and informed\nby AI in relatively personalized form as with Isaac\nAsimov\u2019s robots or a less malevolent version of the\ncomputer Hal 9000 in the movie 2001. The authors\u2019 expe-\nrience to date, however, has been that efforts to \u2018\u2018aid\u2019\u2019\nhumans in games often prove counterproductive, obstruct-\ning the quintessentially human free-form discussion.\nIndeed, the efforts sometimes make the players angry\nbecause of the distractions. With that in mind, we discuss\nTable 4.

Near-term ambitions for decision aids. Table 6 pro-\nvides our subjective estimates, on a scale of low to high,\nfor the value of the simple decision aids shown in the first\ncolumn. None of these involve AI. Rather, the most valu-\nable aids are in the character of simple viewgraphs with\nsuccinct checklists, information tables, or diagrams. The\nevaluation distinguishes among different types of games or\nexercises, and also between games in which players have\nor have not previously been trained with the decision aids.\nThe evaluations were developed after some wargaming\nexperiments conducted by RAND in collaboration with the\nKorea Institute for Defense Analyses.\nAnother data point on simple decision aids is the\nStrange Game developed (but not yet published) by\nRAND colleagues. It is an efficient wargame of nuclear\nuse in which players represent a theater commander and\nmake plays by choosing an appropriate card.20 The game\nbuilds in decision aids that include target categories and a\nsimple linear arithmetic for assessing what targeting\noption to choose.\nAs a final example of near-term decision aids, a recent\nprototype study pursued a low-tech approach to human\nexercises considering how to influence adversaries in crisis\nand conflict. The method involved a qualitative method,\nuncertainty sensitive cognitive modeling (UCM), as sum-\nmarized in Figure 5.19 The mechanisms were all qualita-\ntive, for display and discussion with a real or virtual\nwhiteboard and interactive software. They included factor\ntrees, alternative models of Red with representation of lim-\nited rationality, influence diagrams, and tabular compari-\nson of strategies\u2019 apparent strengths and weaknesses. None\ninvolved AI. It was not evident that AI would even have\nbeen helpful. Perhaps that was an important insight, or per-\nhaps it reflected inadequate imagination. Let us now turn\nto the longer run.\n6.1.3. Longer-term ambitions for AI-enhanced decision\naids. For the longer term, much more may be possible and\nwe should look for inspiration to, for example, science\nTable 6. Value of decision aid types for different types of games.\nTrained?

As mere examples of functions plau-\nsible in the not-too-distant future, in each of which an AI\nsystem responds to queries:\n\u2022 A team verbally orders up an exploratory analysis\nof \u2018\u2018paths to success\u2019\u2019 with and without the stalwart\ncooperation of a particular ally.\n\u2022 A team asks which alternative models of an adver-\nsary continue to be plausible given recent events.\nThe AI report reflects Bayesian-style analysis\ndependent on subjective likelihood functions, which\nhave been updated to reflect recent history.\n\u2022 A team contemplating a limited escalation asks\nabout potential responses. The AI helper shows\nresponses observed in prior wargames with\nplayers thought to represent actual decision-makers\nwell. It also identifies conditions (as discussed in\nthe next section) under which responses have been\nbad in simulation, thereby highlighting what\naspects of condition need special attention to avoid\ndisaster.\nThese speculations are minimal, merely to stimulate\nmore creative thinking about how AI could be useful in\ndecision aiding. The field is wide open, as becomes even\nmore evident from the names given to certain types of AI\nthat see a progression from reactive machines to those with\nlimited memory, built-in theory of mind, and self-aware-\nness. Some leading figures, like Pearl and Mackenzie,51\nconfidently anticipate that the latter will include conscious-\nness itself. That, however, is for the future. Pearl has char-\nacterized current robots as \u2018\u2018as conscious as a slug.\u2019\u2019 That\nsaid, swarming weapons will soon be as \u2018\u2018conscious\u2019\u2019 as\nswarms of birds, fishes, and insects.\nLet us turn next to some vexing issues involving AI\nwith M&S. They related to what AI decision aids are\nfeasible.\n6.2. Issues for ML that exploits massive scenario\ngeneration\nThe machine learning class of artificial intelligence (AI/\nML) has the potential for finding insights by mining the\nresults of massive scenario generation as discussed earlier.\nSuccess, however, depends on (1) the quality of the simu-\nlations and (2) the methods used to search results.\n6.2.1. Are the simulations rich enough to represent essential\ncomplexity? The fruits of massive scenario generation may\nbe useful or counterproductive depending on whether the\nunderlying models are sufficiently rich and structurally\nvalid for the purposes of exploration. In studying possible\nhigh-end crises, what good is a database of a million sce-\nnarios if the underlying models assume perfect rationality,\nperceptions, alliance relationships, and focus on, say, the\npost-exchange ratio of nuclear weapons as a measure of\noutcome? There might be value for military-technical pur-\nposes, such as force planning, but probably not for deter-\nrence or anticipating issues in actual conflict or even\nserious elite wargames.52,53 Similarly, a database of a mil-\nlion scenarios about a Korea conflict in 2018 would have\nhad little value if the issues in question were sensitive to\nthe unmodeled idiosyncratic features of such national lead-\ners as Kim Jong Un, Donald Trump, and Xi Jinping.\nSome aspects of the challenge for model-builders are\nknown, as in recognizing the need for alternative concep-\ntions of the decision-makers (character, personality,\nhealth),21 recognizing the possibility of erroneous percep-\ntions, and allowing for the kinds of non-rational decisions\ndescribed by Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s Prospect\nTheory54,55 and other psychological phenomena.\nAddressing the challenges is difficult, to say the least, but\nat least the challenges are recognized.\nIn contrast, one of the dirty little secrets of military\nsimulation and social-behavioral simulations more gener-\nally is that the workhouse models usually do not generate\nblack-swan events, discontinuities, or the kinds of emer-\ngent phenomena that are a core element in the study of\ncomplex adaptive systems and are experienced in the real\nworld48 and some large and games, such as the \u2018\u2018elite\u2019\u2019\nhigh-level Cold War wargames of the 1950s.52,53 The rea-\nsons are many but often stem from the models being\n\u2018\u2018scripted,\u2019\u2019 rather than agent based, or\u2014even if they do\nhave agents\u2014on not giving the agents sufficient diversity,\ndegrees of freedom, and incentives to generate realistic\nadaptive behaviors, and on not allowing randomness with\nlong-tail distributions. Doing better on such matters is a\ngrand challenge for social-behavioral simulation generally,\nand for the simulations intended to connect well to realis-\ntic wargaming in particular. Some of the ingredients are\nincluded in sophisticated wargaming, so that one may\nobserve, for example, disintegration of an alliance and the\ncreation of new groupings that appear to the teams to bet-\nter serve their national interests. Current-day simulations\ndo not typically allow for such things. Speculatively, we\nsee at least two paths for doing better. If the emergent phe-\nnomenon of interest can be anticipated (such as the alli-\nance issues above), then appropriate objects can be built in\nand the simulation might recognize when to direct them to\ncome into or out of existence. But the most important\nemergent phenomena (including some that appear in war-\ngames) may not be anticipated. Although we do not claim\nto know what is necessary, we observe from the past\nexperiences of complexity research, that emergent phe-\nnomena often come about because of complicated bottom-\nDavis and Bracken 11\nup interactions, diversity, and random events. Traditional\nhigher-level political-military simulations, however, do\nnot have these features. Their value is due in large part to\ntheir representing higher-level entities and processes,\nroughly by analogy with the models of System Dynamics.\nOur conclusion is that it is important, in moving ahead, to\ndevelop multi-resolution families of models and methods\nfor relating them to each other. For example, a higher-\nresolution agent-based model might have adaptive agents\nfor all countries involved in crisis or conflict. Simulation\nexperiments might reveal (as can human games) the kind\nof emergent behaviors mentioned above, such as occa-\nsional dissolution of alliances, side-switching, and the\npopping up of new alliances of convenience. This would\nbe \u2018\u2018insight\u2019\u2019 that could then lead to adding new agents to\nhigher-level models, agents to be activated or deactivated\ndepending on circumstances in the simulation. This, how-\never, would require something like the \u2018\u2018self-aware simu-\nlations\u2019\u2019 discussed in a recent book on social-behavioral\nmodeling,56 particularly the chapter by Yilmaz 44 who\nenvisions computation that monitors its own state and, as\nnecessary, changes its own structure, and a chapter with\ndebate among authors about emergence.57\n6.2.2. Extracting insights from massive scenario generation. If\nthe simulations are sufficiently rich, then meaningful mas-\nsive scenario generation is possible. But then what? A core\nchallenge in exploratory analysis of simulation data is\nunderstanding how to assess the relative significance of\ndifferent cases. One approach is to assign subjective prob-\nability distributions, but where does one find experts who\ncan reliably estimate probabilities without prefacing com-\nments such as \u2018\u2018Well, if tomorrow is like the past.\u2019\u2019\nRealistically, experts are not good sources for predictions\nor probabilities, as has been discussed in-depth by Tetlock\nand colleagues.58\u201360\nA variant approach reports how frequently (in percent-\nage terms) results are, for example, good or bad. This can\nbe done with full factorial design or using the Monte Carlo\nsampling. Unfortunately, the tendency exists to slip into\ndiscussion of \u2018\u2018likelihoods\u2019\u2019 rather than percentages, even\nthough the cases are not equally likely. Also, for the MSG\ncontext, this type of display obscures the reality that actors\nare constantly looking for obscure \u2018\u2018corners\u2019\u2019 of the sce-\nnario space where they will gain major advantages. Thus, a\ncase infrequently observed in simulation may be precisely\nthe case that develops.\nThe approach that we suggest is to eschew assignment\nof explicit probabilities, but instead to \u2018\u2018look for prob-\nlems\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018look for successes.\u2019\u2019 That is, when exploring\nthe vast data generated from exploratory analysis, one\nmay seek to find the conditions under which results are,\nvery good, very bad, or whatever. This is called Scenario\nDiscovery in the literatures on robust decision-making\n(RDM) and DMDU.61\nGoing farther, we urge that the AI be given hints in the\nform of \u2018\u2018aggregation fragments\u2019\u2019 motivated from theory,\nsimple models, and subject-area expertise.62 An example\nmight be \u2018\u2018State of readiness at the time conflict begins.\u2019\u2019\nThe value for that might be the same for drastically differ-\nent combinations of strategic warning time, tactical warn-\ning time, leadership characteristics, prior military\nreadiness, and rate of mobilization. That is, the variable is\nan aggregation over many more microscopic initial states.\nAnother example (assuming suitable agents) might be psy-\nchological state at the time of crisis, with values such as\nParanoid, Calm and Rational, and Confidently aggressive.\nGiven sufficiently rich simulations and theory providing\nhints for the AI to use during exploratory analysis, we sus-\npect that AI could accomplish a great deal in activities such\nas identifying circumstances of \u2018\u2018Perfect Storm\u2019\u2019\u2014not to\npredict them, but to note conditions to avoid, much as has\nbeen done in a low-tech way with simple wargaming.19\n6.2.3. Extracting insights from massive data collection. Another\nML application could create algorithms for wargames and\nM&S from massive intelligence collection on adversary\noperations, such as those of submarines or ground-mobile\nmissiles.63 What once took months or years to collect and\nanalyze may now be available in very short periods of time,\ngenerating algorithms on operational procedures that could\nbe used in wargames or M&S. As an analogue, consider\ngaining insights about driving safety. The deepest insights\ntoday come from insurance companies (Progressive,\nGEICO) based on downloadable software that tracks indi-\nvidual operators: their speed, the number of left turns,\nacceleration patterns, and so on.64 The data can be inte-\ngrated with, for example, credit scores and other data. The\nresult can be individualized premium rates. Such data ana-\nlytics is already today\u2019s reality. There should be analogous\nmilitary and MSG implications. Some, of course, will\nnecessarily be classified and of less significance to the pol-\nmil focus of this paper than to other applications of MSG.\n6.3. Issues for cognitive AI and related decision aids\nThe discussion above focused on ML-style AI, but the rich\nsimulations that are needed must have agents that reason in\nmore human-like ways, something that may be described\nas cognitive AI. In this, the decision logic uses factors and\nreasoning similar to what humans like to believe is the\nbasis of their actual behaviors.\nThe Red and Blue agents of the 1980s RSAS were\nearly examples. They exploited the broadly accepted\nescalation-ladder construct to characterize situations,\noptions, and decision choices in nuclear crisis and conflict.\n12 Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation: Applications, Methodology, Technology 00(0)\nToday, we need a new generation of higher-level decision\nmodels, but no substitute for the escalation ladder exists.\nAnd perhaps no substitute will be found. Complexity\nincreases greatly when going from a two-party game to\neven a three-party game. A replacement concept will\nnecessarily be more complex\u2014more like an n-dimensional\nlattice than a ladder\u2014because escalation can involve not\njust the number of nuclear weapons and their targets, but\ncounts, intensities, and targets relevant to cyberwar, space\nwar, and strategic use of precision fires.\nFigure 6 illustrates the notion clumsily, combining sev-\neral of the dimensions so as to artificially show results in\nonly three dimensions. It shows an illustrative scenario that\nstarts with a tame conventional war (Item 1), but then transi-\ntions sequentially to severe cyberattack (Item 2), more exten-\nsive use of Precision guided missiles (PGMs) (Item 3),\nlimited nuclear use (a nuclear escalation as indicated by the\narrow) (Item 4), even more destructive use of PGMs (e.g.\nagainst dams and power grids) (Item 5) and perhaps a slight\nincrease in the level of WMD (perhaps intended merely as tit\nfor tat), and general nuclear war (Item 6). Today, however,\nno common understanding exists about where a particular\nkind of attack would appear on a given axis and whether\nactors would have the same assessment. Not only is the\n\u2018\u2018objective\u2019\u2019 answer ephemeral at best, perceptions will\nlikely be path dependent, nation dependent, and subject to\nrandom influences. A central issue for planning is whether a\nprotracted non-nuclear war between nuclear-armed near-\npeer states is plausible. The issues have become even more\ntroublesome due to the entanglement of command and con-\ntrol systems for conventional and nuclear warfare.65 It seems\nthat predictive models, whether AI-based or not, are not in\nthe cards, although models generating plausible cases to\nworry about should be.\nMany more challenges might be listed for those seeking\nto build cognitive AI models to represent national\ndecision-makers in crisis, but we hope that our example\nhas whetted appetites.\n7. Conclusion and recommendations\nThe primary suggestion of this paper is to recommend a\nresearch agenda that sees modeling, simulation, gaming,\nand analysis as related and intertwined. In such an inte-\ngrated view, AI for wargaming would be informed by\nanalysis using models that included agents incorporating\nAI informed in part by wargaming. This will lead, for\nexample, to agents with AI resembling the decision aids of\nwargaming as well as more complex algorithms. It will\nlead to decision aids for wargaming that will resemble the\nfruits of applying theory-informed ML to \u2018\u2018data\u2019\u2019 gener-\nated by exploratory analysis from M&S exploiting AI in\nthe form of decision agents.\nWith respect to AI per se, we caution against some of\nthe practices common in today\u2019s ML. We note the absence\nof reliably informative empirical data on future crises and\nconflicts. Furthermore, we emphasize the need, in both\ndecision aids and the agents used in models, for explana-\ntion. This suggests a preference for AI structured by cogni-\ntive modeling even if ML is used to fill out and tune that\nstructure.\nFinally, we urge great caution in what questions are\nasked of wargaming (including small-scale activities such\nas Day-After Exercises66\n) as well as of models. Models,\nsimulations, games, and analysis will remain imperfect\u2014\nsometimes markedly so\u2014but it is possible to use them\nwell to address many issues well, that is, to improve the\nquality of decision-making. Anticipating possibilities has\ngreat potential; reliable prediction does not.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.

Among the\nnewer machine-learning methods, adversarial training and fuzzy cognitive maps seem to have\nparticular unrealized potential.\nThe Working Paper then discusses the troublesome theory-data gap: the mismatch between\nmeasurable data streams and meaningful explanatory theories to frame the data. The Working\nPaper identifies this issue as a key barrier to meaningful social and behavioral modeling. It then\ndiscusses the need to move from purely data-driven work to theory-informed work, and to\ntighten the iterative loop between theory and data analysis.\nClosing the theory-data gap is a general problem. The Working Paper illustrates three\nexample models that attempt to integrate theory-informed and data-driven modeling: a network\nmodel, factor tree model, and a fuzzy cognitive map model. The first model addresses meme\ntransmission. The last two address the public support for terrorism.\nThe Working Paper identifies key questions and challenges along the way. These are\nquestions that a notional social and behavioral modeling research community will need to tackle\nas it grows.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited)\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Objectives\nThere is a growing demand to develop social and behavioral models competent to inform\ndecisionmaking in such diverse domains as counter-insurgency, political polarization, adversary\npropaganda campaigns, and public health behaviors. Success will depend on effective use of\nempirical information drawn from observation of both online- and physical-network human\nbehavior. The objectives of this discussion are\n(1) to characterize the current infrastructure of data relevant to behavioral modeling;\n(2) to describe progress on methods relevant to behavioral modeling that come from research\non artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML);\n(3) to identify shortcomings and challenges with current modeling approaches;\n(4) to suggest where advances are needed to address them;\n(5) to identify some mechanisms for doing so.\n1.2 Background\nAn earlier study conducted over three years by the National Research Council (Zacharias et\nal., 2008) presented a comprehensive review of social and behavioral modeling. Most of that\nanalysis remains solid and apt today. Thus, we focus primarily on selected developments over\nthe last 10 years.\n2 Relevant Advances\n2.1 Overview\nTwo trends relevant to this Working Paper have been notable over the last decade (1) the\nburgeoning of data, data sources, and data infrastructure; and (2) advances in\nintelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) methods.\nData: Social Media More Than MMOGs. The 2008 NRC report highlighted Massive\nMultiplayer Online Games (MMOG) platforms, surveys, and ethnography as predominant\nsources of behavioral data for training behavioral models. Some recent work has explored\nMMOGs for understanding observed social behaviors (e.g., identifying patterns observable in the\nplay of Pok\u00e9mon Go (Althoff et al., 2016; Althoff et al., 2017)). More generally, however, it\nseems that the usefulness of MMOG platforms for behavioral insight is less than was imagined.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 2\nMMOGs are interesting troves of data, but the insights appear not to add much to the foundations\nof behavioral modeling research. This observation makes sense in hindsight. MMOGs are\nspecific ecosystems of behaviors, and contrived ones at that. Researchers can distil out\ninteresting patterns of behavior (Tomai et al., 2013), but these are not necessarily generalizable\nor informative outside the contrived environment. Arguably, surveys and ethnography (including\nmicro-narratives) are better for eliciting insights on more general behavioral patterns, although\nthey can be unwieldy and intrusive. Ubiquitous social media platforms seem to be popular as\nsources of relevant behavioral data for now. We shall discuss some of this in a later section.\nAI/ML Methods. As for advances in AI/ML methods, we construe the topic broadly to\ninclude:\n- Adaptive statistics- and optimization- based methods for teaching computers to identify\nor exploit regularities in signals (Machine Learning or Pattern Recognition)\n- Expert-, Rule- or logic-based methods for planning, problem solving or knowledge\nrepresentation.\n- Models for representing or imitating cognition and decision-making (human or\notherwise)\nThese topics fall under the useful general definition of AI as the discipline \u201cconcerned with\nintelligent behavior in artifacts1 .\u201d\nThe term \u201cmachine learning\u201d (ML) often refers to the more statistically flavored sub-fields\nlike supervised, unsupervised, & reinforcement learning. Other AI sub-fields rely more on\nsymbolic-based and rule-based methods for tasks like knowledge representation and automated\nplanning. Some earlier versions of these were known as expert systems and knowledge-based\nsystems in the 1980s. These include AI approaches like automated planning solvers, fuzzy\ncognitive maps (Amirkhani et al., 2017), and tree-based methods for parsing semantics and\nontologies. Other non-ML strands of AI research include cognitive modeling architectures like\nBDI (Tambe et al., 1988), Soar (Georgeff et al., 1998), ACT-R (Anderson, 1996), and EPIC\n(Rubinstein et al., 2001). These have been useful for enabling tasks like team-based collaboration\nin robots. The varied nature of social and behavioral modeling requires the full diversity AI\nmethods. We see it as important to consider all of these methods (i.e., to include what some refer\nto as both strong and weak strands of AI).2\n1 There have been numerous other attempts to define AI canonically. This description is due to Nilsson (Nilsson,\n1998). McCarthy (2007) defines intelligence as \u201cthe computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\u201d\nMinsky (1961) gave an enumeration of functions required for such intelligence: search, pattern recognition, learning,\nplanning, and induction (or generalization from observed examples). Any artificially constructed or software-based\nsystem performing combinations of these functions to achieve goals in the world will qualify as AI for the purpose\nof our discussion.\n2 Strong AI aspires to computer programs that represent human cognition and achieve significant aspects of human-\nlike intelligence. AI researchers are strongly divided about the degree to which strong AI is feasible.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 3\nNumerous relationships exist among what are sometimes treated as different methods. The\nauthors of the 2008 NRC report generated one depiction of the various methods and how they\nrelate to each other, as indicated in Figure 1. Although useful for drafting and structuring the\nlarge and complex NRC report, Figure 1 uses a fine-grained disaggregation of modeling\napproaches, which the report discussed as Individual, Organizational, and Societal (IOS)\nmodeling tools. For our purposes, such a disaggregation downplays how deeply interconnected\nthese approaches sometimes are and sometimes should be. For example, the optimization node\n(near bottom left) stands alone in the figure. However, a central theme in current ML methods is\nlearning-as-optimization (see dashed line 1); much of modern ML relies on optimization\nprocedures like stochastic gradient descent during training. The distinction between machine\nlearning and statistics is also not nearly wide as the figure suggests (see dotted line 2). Another\nproblem with such a disaggregation is that it may obscure opportunities for innovation. An\nimportant recent innovation in AI/ML, generative adversarial networks (GANs), combines game\ntheory and machine learning to improve unsupervised learning tasks. Other current innovations\ninclude the use of statistical, ML, and social network analysis methods to infer behavioral\npatterns (Sapiezynski et al., 2016).\nFigure 1 A Similarity Network of Modeling Methods\nSource: Adapted from NRC report (Zacharias et al., 2008) p. 93\nThe subsequent sections discuss advances in data sources and AI/ML in more detail.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 4\n2.2 Advances in Data Infrastructure\n2.2.1 New Sources\nMany new data sources have emerged in the last decade as important ecosystems for\nexhibiting and recording behavioral patterns. Each data source has blind spots. On the one hand,\na larger ecosystem might be expected to increase the chances of capturing key behavioral\ninformation. On the other hand, a smaller data ecosystem would require less modeling effort and\nmight be more cost efficient because infrastructure costs burgeon with ecosystem size, perhaps\nfaster than any benefits. Nonetheless, from a purely modeling perspective, one might think that\nmore data from more sources should\u2014other things being equal\u2014increase capacity for\nbehavioral modeling.\nSome novel data streams have already shown value for behavioral modeling. For example,\nsocial media (SM) data has become ubiquitous and is now an important analytic tool in national\npolitics. Social-media platforms also serve as tools for influencing discourse and for measuring\nbehaviors/influence. Social media platforms measure individual data and also relational or\nnetwork data. The ascendance of social media platforms has led to a rise in methods and tools for\ndealing with relational/network/graph information.\nCellular Data Records (CDRs), including metadata are also valuable, especially for inferring\nspatial behavioral preferences. Recent research indicates that CDRs are very useful for\nidentifying spatial behaviors relevant to, e.g., migration/disaster response (Bengtsson et al.,\n2011), shopping patterns (De Montjoye et al., 2015), and personal network affinities. The recent-\nyear developments related to \u201cWikiLeaks\u201d demonstrate the real-life significance of even limited\nmetadata from cellular data records.\nOther novel data streams include:\n\u2010 financial records from banks, retail records, and financial technology firms (FinTech)\n\u2010 public and private video surveillance from street cameras, and cellphone recordings\n\u2010 voice records: from AI personal assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Now)\nThe growth in behaviorally relevant data streams mirrors a growing reliance on tools and\ndevices for mediating behaviors (e.g. GPS for navigation, music streams for mood management,\nsocial media platforms for expression). It is now common to have records or signals of an\nindividual\u2019s plans, intentions, and mental states in digital form, especially in affluent cultures\nwith high smartphone adoption. Clark and Chalmers (Clark & Chalmers, 1998) used the term\n\u201cThe Extended Mind\u201d to refer to the extension of mental deliberation and cognition outside the\n(as yet) unobservable confines of the human mind. Extended minds with accessible digital data\nexhausts can be potentially revolutionary for behavioral modeling. The data ecosystem seems to\nbe growing in that direction.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 5\n2.2.2 Evaluating the Data Ecosystem\nWhatever its primary function may be, for our purposes a data ecosystem serves a\nmeasurement function. It value in this role depends on at least the following:\n1. Representativeness of the measured population: the measured population (the\nproxy population) should be representative of the background population about which\nwe want to infer behavioral patterns. Unfortunately, social media platforms generally\nexhibit significant proxy population mismatch (Ruths and Pfeffer, 2014). Proxy\npopulation mismatch has been implicated as the primary reason for the errors\nobserved in social media polls (Chung and Mustafaraj, 2011; O\u2019Connor et al., 2010;\nGayo-Avello, 2013).\n2. Signal Fidelity & Resolution: The value of a measurement tool depends on its\nability to indicate signals of interest faithfully. Can the data unambiguously indicate\nbehavioral signals of interest? At reasonable effort? Linguistic interactions (e.g. on\nsocial media platforms), for example, may not recognize behavioral signals such as\nsarcasm without considerable effort to parse the data. Also, the ability to usefully\nindicate location or geographical behavior depends on the resolution of the location\nsensors. Signal fidelity also includes questions of misrepresentation in observed\nsignals. The ability of agents (human or organizational) to harbor unrevealed or\nunstable preferences and engage in game-theoretic behaviors means that dishonest\nsignaling can be prevalent in behavioral contexts. Behavioral models will need to\naccount for misrepresentation in signals.\n3. Systemic Selective Non-response: Silence\u2014i.e., the absence of data\u2014 is sometimes\nextremely informative, especially for active voluntary interactions. Unfortunately, the\ntendency in analysis is to emphasize signal presence over absence. This tendency has\nbeen implicated as a potential cause of excessive polarization in social media\ninteractions. Studies of political discourse on blogs and social media platforms\nhighlight the tendency for hyperpolarized minorities to commandeer discourse and\nthereby skew platform data streams away from underlying population preferences\n(Tumasjan et al., 2014).\n2.2.3 Trends\nThe data ecosystem is likely to keep growing, perhaps even exponentially as the Internet of\nThings (IoT) takes off. The goal is not just to obtain larger quantities of data, but also to obtain\nmore raw/unfiltered qualitative & quantitative data, free of the self-report and interpretive biases\nthat often afflict surveys and ethnographies. This ecosystem skews heavily towards observational\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 6\ndata as opposed to controlled trial data that would identify causal connections more readily. This\nlimits the fitness of the data ecosystem for some purposes.\nQuestions of data quality, fitness for use, and access will be key. Much of the data ecosystem\nexists under different jurisdictions, access/legal restrictions, and quality levels. There will likely\nbe a growing demand for methods and practices for fusing data sources and patching blind spots\nin the ecosystem. Advances in AI/ML, discussed below, may help. Besides those discussed\nbelow, the research community is also developing important tools like quasi-experimental\napproaches for inferring causality from observational data and fusion methods for fusing\nheterogeneous data/knowledge/information sources. These could be invaluable in time.\nAlthough we do not dwell on the matter here, substantial questions and concerns exist about\nthe rules and regulations governing the use of such data e.g. questions of data privacy, data\nrepresentativeness, and legal access to data (Levendowski, 2017).\n2.3 Advances in AI/ML\nMany of the advances in AI/ML have occurred in AI sub-fields that use statistical learning\nconcepts (pattern recognition including advanced regression, clustering, classification). Expert\nsystems, rule-based, and solver-based AIs continue to be important for problems like planning\nand knowledge representation, but progress there has not gotten as much popular attention. We\nmention them nonetheless. For example, we present an expert system, a fuzzy cognitive map\n(FCM) (Osoba and Kosko, 2017), for modeling behaviors later in this Working Paper. Fuzzy-\nbased expert systems also have robust mechanisms for knowledge fusion. Such fusion\napproaches hold promise for addressing the issue of limited model federation (which we\nhighlight later). Other AI sub-fields like knowledge representation may be useful for specifying\nunderlying behavioral ontologies.\n2.3.1 Deep Learning\nDeep learning (DL) is the most touted recent trend in machine learning. Traditional\nconnectionist machine learning models, by definition, connect nonlinear processing (neural)\nunits configured in shallow hierarchies or layers to solve classification, regression, or dimension\nreduction tasks. Shallow networks are limited in the complexity of features (or combinations of\ninput variables) they can find and use. But deeper hierarchies are harder to train. Deep learning\nleverages advances in computational power and statistical learning theory to update the standard\nconnectionist learning models with deeply stacked layers of processing units. The use of deep\nstacks allows the model to identify complex features in the data that can be useful for improving\nthe model\u2019s performance.\nDepth in learning architectures is an idea that has been considered for much of the history of\nmachine learning research. The main hurdle preventing the exploitation of deep architectures has\nbeen limits in usable computing power. Machine learning models solve an optimization problem\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 7\nin the process of learning. The optimization problem is a function of the number of tunable\nparameters in the model. Neural network models (both shallow and deep) typically rely on the\nbackpropagation algorithm for parameter tuning. Shallow models have fewer parameters than\ndeep models. The difficulty of the optimization task grows exponentially with the number of\nparameters. So deep models can be prohibitively computationally intensive. Deep models often\nalso require larger data sets for training. The key factors that make DL models feasible are the\nexistence of large application-relevant data sets and massive computing power. Our previous\ndiscussion already highlighted the growth of the ecosystem of behavior-related data. Available\ncomputational power has also grown explosively.\nMore recent DL advances include the use of time varying layer weights that allows models to\nincorporate temporal memory. These are called recurrent neural nets (RNNs). These models are\nuseful for modeling time-series with temporal correlations. Depth in these models refers to the\nlength of time-dependence in the signal, not number of layers. Long short-term memory\n(LSTMs) models are a popular type of RNN model. LSTMs are used for handwriting recognition\nin some Windows systems. They have also shown good results in the generation of text for\ndialog (e.g. chatbots). LSTMs are especially useful for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks\n(Sutskever et al., 2014) (e.g. machine language translation like the Google Neural Machine\nTranslation (Wu et al., 2016)). The DL community has also made widespread use of the\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for video, image, speech, and text tasks. CNNs\nare neural networks with layers that apply biologically inspired weighted local averages (or\nconvolutions) to input signal fields. CNNs are especially effective at image tasks.\nThe value of DL for social and behavioral modeling lays mainly the ability of DL models to\nconvert a larger portion of the data ecosystem into behaviorally meaningful signals. The\nsemantics of images and videos used in social interactions become more accessible using the\nappropriate DL model. The next section talks about natural language processing (NLP). Much\nof the recent advances in NLP are due to the application of DL models to language tasks. DL has\nalso fostered the development of computing architecture for scalable computation on large data\nsets. But DL models themselves have not had a large footprint so far as tools for modeling social\nbehavior directly.\n2.3.2 Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nThe most important AI improvement relevant to behavioral modeling over the last half-\ndecade has probably been the maturation of natural language processing (NLP). This includes\ntext mining, topic modeling, sentiment inference, speech recognition, machine translation, etc.\nThese are important because they enable the quantitative analysis of textual data. Behavioral\ncues in language use are now observable. Caliskan-Islam et al. (Caliskan-Islam et al., 2015;\nCaliskan-Islam et al., 2016) demonstrates an example of behavioral modeling (identifying telltale\npatterns of language use) based on natural language processing.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 8\nTopic modeling (Blei, 2012; Blei and Lafferty, 2006) has been particularly useful for\nmeasuring trends in what is otherwise unstructured data. Blei gives an example of the use of\nNLP methods to track publishing behaviors in academic fields (Blei, 2012). Topic modeling\ntools have also been indispensable in the analysis of micro text corpora from social media\nplatforms (e.g. short tweets). Some social-media studies use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\nfor natural language processing (Gross and Murthy, 2014).\nOther modes of text analysis are needed. Topic modeling is a strictly statistical analysis of\ntext with limited use of semantics or lexical structure. It treats text as pure symbols with no\nmeaning separate from the statistical co-occurrence patterns learned from corpora. Significant\ninsight can be gained from this purely symbolic analysis (as its current use in text mining\nindicates), but topic-modeling results still require significant human interpretation to identify\nunderstand context-dependent meanings. Automated tools for semantic, lexical, and lexico-\ngraphic analysis of larger bodies of discourse can improve social and behavioral SB models. The\nrise of NLP suites of tools like word2vec and GloVe represent increasing capacity for the\nalgorithmic comprehension of text meaning. They are currently good at solving analogical\nquestions \u2013 arguably the minimal task required to indicate semantic comprehension.\nAutomated Machine Translation (AMT) is another NLP domain with significant innovation.\nGoogle recently introduced the Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) (Wu et al., 2016)\nfor language translation using an end-to-end neural network framework trained in a purely data-\ndriven fashion (no pre-coded language rules) (Sutskever et al., 2014).\n2.3.3 Adversarial Training for Unsupervised Learning\nThe discovery of Adversarial Training approaches may hold the most promise for future\nsocial-behavioral modeling and related AI. Goodfellow et al. first introduced adversarial training\nto the AI community in their development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n(Goodfellow et al., 2014; Radford et al., 2015). The training approach takes inspiration from\ngame theory and minimax decision-making.\nThe standard statistical learning approach begins with training data and a parameterized\nmodel (e.g. regressions, perceptrons, support vector machines, or neural networks). The goal is\nto learn a desired behavior encoded in the training data. Changing the model parameters changes\nthe behavior of the model. Learning algorithms encode the behavior to be learned as critical\npoints of an objective function over the model\u2019s parameter space. Statistical learning (clustering,\nfitting, classification, regression being the major forms) thus often reduces to stochastic\noptimization (Vapnik, 2013). This mode of automated learning works well for problems in which\nthe desired behavior is reasonably articulable as objective functions e.g. image/facial recognition\nand some aspects of natural language processing. This is essentially a teacher-student learning\nmodel.\nLearning to generate more subtle but sometimes crucial behaviors from data sets can be\nmuch harder. For example, generating believable super-resolved images, social networks,\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 9\nconversations, or even facial expressions is difficult. The key theme in these tasks is the need to\nlearn implicit models of data generation (Mohamed and Lakshminarayanan, 2016; Diggle and\nGratton, 1984). These are models for which the generative structure is apparent but not easily\narticulable. And thus the process of learning the structure consists of model adaptation in\nresponse to a repeated game of discriminating between examples.\nAdversarial training proceeds as a game between two agents: the generator and the discriminator.\nThe generator\u2019s goal is to learn to produce samples that are representative of the training data.\nThe discriminator\u2019s goal is to learn to discriminate between the generator\u2019s output and samples\nfrom the training data. Both agents escalate in the course of training to the point where the\ngenerator has learned to behave indistinguishably from the training data. The learning model is\nessentially an actor-critic learning model (Pfau and Vinyals, 2016). Adversarial training provides\na way for AI systems to do better in games-against-nature scenarios or in adversarial scenarios\n(e.g., individuals are seeking to hide information or even mislead). Such training could enable\nagents in social science models to learn behaviors that are not easy to encode or explain (e.g.\nidentifying fake news or recognizing patterns in the presence of efforts to hide them or deceive).\n2.3.4 Reinforcement learning\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of statistical machine learning focused on teaching\nagents how to act to achieve goals in an uncontrolled environment (Sutton and Barto, 1998). It\nhas its origins in research on control theory, robotics, automated planning, and behavioral\npsychology. RL\u2019s key defining features are the explicit modeling of the environment, the built-in\nemphasis on exploration, the sparsity of evaluative feedback to guide the agent\u2019s learning, and\nthe learning of action policies from experience or data. The rise of RL is a response to the\ninadequacies of supervised learning for planning-style tasks in which the value of real-time\nactions derive from their downstream effects rather than immediate evaluations. Planning is an\nintegral part of human social behavior. And we need models that can capture such behaviors.\nFigure 2 Standard Reinforcement Learning Framework (adapted from (Sutton and Barto, 1998))\nThe maturation of reinforcement learning enables the development of large-scale agent based\nmodels (ABMs) with adaptive or learning agents (including agents that learn or adapt based on\nAgent\nEnvironment\nActionState Reward\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 10\nsimulations). Developments in reinforcement learning may allow for more adaptive ABM\nmodels of intelligent human behavior in complex adaptive systems.\n2.3.4 Emulating Human Biases and Bounded Rationality\nAnother important area of work on AI/ML deals with methods for learning true or revealed\npreferences. This is important for behavioral modeling because self-report data and behaviorally\nrevealed preferences often diverge (Rudder, 2014). Biases in preferences drive many social\nbehaviors. Research on cognitive biases, as reviewed in (Kahneman, 2011), shows that biases\nperform useful functions even if they sometimes lead users astray. More specifically, recent\nwork by Pita et al. (Pita et al., 2010) on security games shows the importance of accurately\nmodeling human bounded rationality (Simon, 1996; Simon and Newell, 1962). Eliminating\nheuristic biases (or even irrational aspects of decision-making) from social-behavioral simulation\nmodels may reduce their descriptive accuracy. The social simulations need to reflect true biases\nand preferences.\nResearchers are beginning to develop simple games and other methods to discover hidden\npreferences. These may help address the NRC concern about reproducing non-rational agent\nbehaviors in models (Zacharias et al., 2008, p.359). It is also important, as discussed in the\nliteratures on deterrence (National Research Council, 2014, p.37) and \u201cwicked problems\u201d (Rittel\nand Noble, 1989) to recognize that humans (all of us) often do not actually have the stable utility\nfunctions postulated by both rational-actor theory and usual versions of bounded-rationality\ntheory. We often discover or develop values in the processes of human interaction and\nexperience. \u201cLimited rationality\u201d is sometimes used to refer to problems that go beyond those of\nbounded rationality (Davis, 2014b, p.6). Such problems include mental-health problems (as\nwhen leaders are perhaps depressed and using alcohol or drugs, and are sometimes paranoid) and\nemotion-driven irrational acts (op cit).\n2.3.5 Trends\nMost of the AI/ML methods highlighted seem to have more promise as tools for\ncomprehending novel data streams than as new approaches to social and behavioral modeling.\nThe application of RL to ABMs may prove to be the exception in time. But the addition of\nheterogeneous data comprehension and fusion capabilities to the behavioral modeling repertoire\nis substantial boon, if nothing else.\nPerhaps a key limitation of many currently popular AI/ML methods is the over-\nrepresentation of feed-forward model structures. This limits the use of such methods to sub-tasks\nof the behavioral modeling enterprise (e.g. NLP). Training statistical models that feature\nfeedbacks can be daunting or unstable. But many interesting behaviors involve significant\namounts of feedback. The feed-forward emphasis also inhibits the representation of chaotic\ndynamics that can often occur in behavioral models (e.g. in simple predator-prey models\n(Schaffer 1985)), especially complex ones. The introduction of ML models like GANs and\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 11\nLSTMs marks a growing emphasis on simple feedback in ML models. Some less popular AI\nmodels like FCMs for modeling causal networks also model feedback since causation often\nfeatures feedback loops.\n3 Data and Theory for Behavioral Modeling and Simulation\n3.1 Prefacing Comments on Fundamentals\nCertain foundational questions must be addressed if we are to model and simulate social\nbehavior. These include how to represent aspects of behavior, how to understand and establish\n\u201cvalidity,\u201d and how to compose models from smaller models (model federation). We do not\naddress all such questions here. Here, we focus on the question of: how to relate theory and data.\nThe relationship between theory and data demands further scrutiny because of the advent of\n\u201cbig data\u201d. Advances in AI/ML, driven in part by the glut of big-data sources, has pre-disposed\nmodelers to focus on data as the primary foundation for building and validating models of\nbehavior. This data focus is evident in the emphasis on predictive power in much of modern\nmachine learning approaches to modeling. The growth of ML modeling approaches is arguably\ndue to the ability to convert measures of predictive validity into concrete mathematical objective\nfunctions (e.g. classification accuracy for classification, mean squared error for regressions) that\nare directly amenable to optimization methods. Explanatory power, if considered at all, has been\na secondary goal\u2014sometimes with the rationale that increases in predictive power \u201csurely\u201d occur\ndue to increases in the intrinsic or effective explanatory power of the model, even if that\nincreased explanatory power is difficult to verify because the model complicated or opaque. That\nrationalization is neither valid nor acceptable. Explanatory power is extremely important for\nsocial and behavioral modeling, especially when that is to be used to inform decision-making\n(Davis et al., 2017). A purely data-driven modeling approach would be inadequate and\npotentially misguided.\n3.2 For want of good theory\u2026\nResearchers have multiple examples highlighting the inadequacies of purely data-driven\nmodels in complex domains. Recent discussion (Jonas and Kording, 2017; The Economist, 2017)\nargues that many data-driven neuroscience techniques aimed at uncovering brain architecture\nand function are misguided. One example involves the common approach of localizing function\nin the brain based on observations of function loss or impairment due to localized brain lesions.\nThe authors apply modern data-driven neuroscience techniques to an older simpler\nmicroprocessor. The goal was to reconstruct the known architecture of the microprocessor by\nanalysis of measured signals and localized impairments or interventions\u2014 the way a\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 12\nneuroscientist might seek to reconstruct the architecture of brain. The methods failed to identify\nhigh-level structures (e.g. the arithmetic and logic unit) fundamental to explaining the\nmicroprocessor\u2019s function.3 The failure of the methods at identifying crucial structures in a\nsimpler system raises questions about the ability of these methods to make sense or explain brain\nfunctions physiologically.\nAn older critique of heavily data-driven models of behavior is Chomsky\u2019s critique\n(Chomsky, 1959; Fodor, 1965) of B.F. Skinner\u2019s model of learned verbal behavior. Skinner had\nput forward a theoretical model of language acquisition in which infants learn language entirely\nfrom experience filtered through a sparse operant conditioning learning framework. Chomsky\nargued that Skinner\u2019s theory of verbal behavior was wrong because the stimulus-response\nmechanism it hinged on was too sparse to account for the speed of language acquisition and the\nobserved complexities of language use. He further argued that the human facility with language\nlikely exists because of an innate grammar acquisition model more complex than operant\nconditioning.\nEfforts at building social and behavioral models are subject to similar misspecification risks.\nData-driven behavioral models, without the benefit of strong hints from plausible social-science\ntheories of behavior may have poor explanatory power\u2014especially in nonlinear systems. The\nstatistical models may not even be useful for postdiction or post-hoc sense-making. To be sure,\nfully theory-driven modeling can also be seriously misguided.\nIn an ideal situation with complete relevant theory and perfect and\ncomplete data, the data validates the theories and the theories provide an\nexplanatory/interpretive frame for the data. The current situation, however, is\nvery different: we have a lot of data but it is often imperfect, incomplete, and/or biased, and we\nhave a great many social-science \u201ctheories,\u201d which are often narrow, fragmentary, unvalidated,\nand certainly not settled. 4\nKey Questions: How do we design models that are valid for purpose and\nrepresentative of the relevant reality when the data and theories are\nunsettled? What is the right balance of theory and data focus in models?\nAnd what are the best practices on weaving the two together effectively?\n3 Mathematically, a core problem is that statistical methods do not \u201cdiscover\u201d model fragments that are not part of\nthe specification used.\n4 It is notable that in the social sciences, \u201ctheory\u201d may correspond to nothing more than a single-variable hypothesis,\nsuch as \u201cMore of X should tend to increase Y,\u201d whereas in the physical sciences \u201ctheory\u201d often (but not always) is\nregarded as that which pulls together a great many considerations coherently. Thus, in conversation, a physical\nscientist may use the word \u201ctheory\u201d in a very positive way, whereas a social scientist may regard someone else\u2019s\n\u201ctheory\u201d skeptically, as nothing more than yet another hypothesis to be tested. Miscommunication occurs routinely\non this matter.\nUsual statistical\nanalysis use\n\u201cspecifications\u201d\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 13\n3.3 The Scope of Theory and Laws for Behavioral Models\nSome earlier literature on the validity of modeling and simulation (M&S) often supposed that\ncomplete systems understanding is the key to good models. In other words, good models should\nhave structural validity. This is not necessarily true; good theories are necessary but they often\ndo not need to be perfect, complete, or structurally isomorphic to the real system. This point will\nbe important as we attempt to tease out the laws and theories needed for good social-behavioral\nmodeling and simulation.\nThe most persuasive way to argue this is perhaps to appeal to daily experience. We do not\nuse detailed mental models of the world to function successfully. The taxi driver does not need a\ncomprehensive mental model of car mechanics or of petro-chemistry to operate his taxi.\nSimilarly, animals do not need a full understanding of physical theories (e.g. Newton\u2019s laws or\nquantum mechanics) to thrive.\nSo also, an agent\u2019s internal models of and behaviors in complex systems need not be perfect.\nThey should, however, reflect effective theories (Randall, 2017) to guide their behavior in the\nsystem over time. These are simplified mental models that have proven sufficiently useful for\nguiding the agent\u2019s actions even though they are not fully accurate or complete.\nKey Questions: Is the social science research community able to identify\nwhich theories of social behavior are effective theories vs. accurate\ntheories vs. just interesting-but-invalid theories? Is there a stable\nmechanism or framework for making this distinction? How\nuseful is data for this purpose?\nThis value of effective theories for useful modeling suggests a\ndiagnostic concept for modeling practice: \u201cthe model-inquiry gap.\u201d This is\nthe conceptual gap between the level of a model\u2019s representation of the world and the level of\nanalysis the model is meant to inform. It is one aspect of estimating how well a model matches\nits purpose. One example of a large model-inquiry gap would be using a quantum mechanical\nmodel in an attempt to answer questions about planetary motion. It would simply be\ninappropriate. An example of a small model-inquiry gap (i.e., a good match) might be using a\nsocial network model to study individual influence in an organization. Where a broad gap exists,\nusing the model (if it can be used at all) will require vastly more effort, to include extensive\ncalibration if good and comprehensive data exists, than if a suitably simpler model were used.\nEffective theories act as tools for reducing the gap with lower effort. This is also the reason that\nrecent discussion of DoD\u2019s modeling for defense planning decried over-dependence on detailed\nmodels and urged greater emphasis on simpler models (with more detailed models used to study\nselected issues in more detail, which is often crucial). The lesson is not to choose simple rather\nthan complex, but to have the right family of models for both broad analysis and for in-depth\nanalysis when necessary (Davis, 2014a).\nThe Model-Inquiry\nGap\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 14\nThe use of effective theories is a way to give agents some aspects of bounded rationality5\n(Cioffi-Revilla, 2014, p.132) as they try to act in complex environments. With effective theories\nit is possible to create models and simulations of poorly understood systems that are valuable and\nvalid for a purpose (Zacharias et al., 2008). Comparison of game-theoretic models in Stackelberg\ngames (used as a proxy model for critical infrastructure defense) and empirical data showed that\nhumans deviate significantly but predictably from rational expectations. Failing to incorporate\nbounded rationality in behavioral models leads to sub-optimal or invalid models (Pita et al.,\n2010).\nKey Questions: What are the standard or best-practice approaches for\nequipping behavioral models with the kinds of heuristic decisionmaking\nmechanisms that humans demonstrate? When is it important to do so?\nConsider the preceding discussion as a discussion on the depth of a model\u2019s theories. What\nabout the breadth of a model? What is the relevant scope of a model? Most systems of interest\nare sub-systems of larger systems. There will be interactions within the hierarchy of systems.\nIdentifying which interactions and systems are relevant to the modeler\u2019s interest is not always\nobvious. Casting too wide a net leads to large unwieldy models. An overly parsimonious model\nmay be too incomplete to be valid for purpose.\nHerbert Simon argues that most systems are nearly-decomposable federations of subsystems\n(Simon, 1996; Simon, 2002). This is because there are evolutionary fitness benefits to abstracting\naway functions into subsystems, rather than having a single, entangled monolithic system of\nfunctions (Simon, 2002). Near-decomposability tends to improve adaptability and reduce\nfragility. This suggests that that composite social-behavioral models need to be well designed so\nthat they have the benefits of near-decomposability.\nWe are much less sanguine about the role of federated models than was the NRC report\n(Zacharias et al., 2008). Model composition will be important for particular purposes, but the\ntendency to adopt \u201capproved\u201d model federations with \u201capproved\u201d input data should be fiercely\nresisted because the problems of interest tend to be dominated by uncertainty. Analysis in such\ncases needs to be uncertainty sensitive.\nKey Questions: When should do federated models be encouraged and, in\nthose cases, how should they be designed and used?\n3.4 The Scope of Data for Behavioral Models\nWhat about the system data? System data here refers to measurement of the system\u2019s state.\nThe typical roles of system data in modeling are tuning models, validating models, generating\n5 Herbert Simon\u2019s bounded rationality refers to making decisions under constraints like imperfect or incomplete\ninformation, limited or imperfect computational capacity, and limited time\u2014i.e., the kinds of constraints that almost\nalways apply in real life.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 15\nhypotheses of underlying systems behavior, and finally for establishing the appropriate inputs for\na given application of simulation. Systems data in our context includes behavioral or social data.\nThe emerging \u201cBig Data\u201d ecosystem is creating a steady stream of behavioral data (Ohm,\n2010). A significant body of data-driven work exists on mobility behavior (De Montjoye et al.,\n2013), financial behavior (De Montjoye et al., 2015), and personal networks (Sapiezynski et al.,\n2016). The goal of these is to help make sense of how people behave or make decisions. Such\ninsights would be commercially useful for improving targeted advertising and other applications\nthat deal with transitions from user intent to user action. Much of this work leverages newer\ndata-driven methods to highlight patterns. But they tend to fall short on making sense of the\npatterns they find.\nThis sense-making is important if behavioral models are to reach their potential. Social and\nbehavioral simulations will need to bridge the theory-data gap. Characterizing behavior without a\ntheoretical frame is often not enough to determine proper interventions. And positing theories of\nuser behavior without empirical support is not enough.\nKey Questions: Which data-driven methods are most useful for sense-\nmaking? Which methods have limited sense-making value (deep\nlearning)? What would a research program focused on developing\nmethods for sense-making look like?\nSome of the issues have been discussed recently in a volume summarizing results of DoD\u2019s\nHuman Social, Cultural, and Behavioral Modeling program (HSCB) (Egeth et al., 2014) (see,\ne.g., Chapter 10).\nCausal inference is another consideration that motivates the need for a theory frame around\nbehavioral data. Good causal theories, however, must include variables and relationships that are\noften omitted. For example, some theories and formalisms do not include feedback cycles. Also,\nThe variables used for hypothesis testing statistical work are often not very appropriate for causal\nexplanation because they are poor proxies for the \u201creal\u201d variables of interest and because they\nsometimes lock in a simplistic framework (e.g., linear dynamics and trivialized rational-actor\ndecisionmaking).6\nKey Questions: The current data ecosystem is strongly skewed towards\nthe collection of observational data. What is the state of scalable methods\n(quasi-experimental methods) for extracting causal relationships from\nobservational data? Are the limits of causal inference on observational\ndata going to diminish with a larger ecosystem? Or are these limits\nfundamental? Are there robust scalable ways of eliciting causal insight\nfrom experts?\n6 Attempting to use quantitative social-science \u201ctheories\u201d to inform policy-level issues is strongly criticized in\n(Davis, 2011, p.326ff), drawing on criticisms from within the social-science community itself (Sambanis, 2004;\nKalyvas, 2008). A major problem was said to be the tendency for the quantitative work to be aggregated and too\nlittle informed by factors known to be important from more micro-level case studies.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 16\n3.4 Bridging the Theory-Data Gap\n3.4.1 Initial Observations\nModels are sometimes starkly dichotomized models as theory-driven vs. data-driven, but it is\nbetter to think in terms of a spectrum.\n- On one end, the theory-driven approach is said to rely on deductive reasoning \u2013 using\ngeneral system laws to infer behavior in specific instances.\n- At the other end, the data-driven approach is said to rely more on inductive reasoning \u2013\nusing a collection of specific observations to abstract out governing laws and\nrelationships.\n- Abductive reasoning is a somewhat intermediate mode of reasoning. Abductive\nreasoning starts from a portfolio of general hypotheses or laws and proceeds to rank\nthem based on how well they match observed data. Abduction is concerned with\nmaking \u201cinferences to the best explanation.\u201d This bridges the gap between theory-\nfocused and data-focused approaches.7\nThe approach we urge is shifting the balance in social-behavioral search from a statistics-\nand-data-driven dominance toward a healthier abductive approach in which theory informs data\nanalysis and data analysis informs theory in a continuous dynamic tension. This corresponds as\nwell to urging a relatively greater emphasis on causal modeling rather than correlational work.8\nThinking now of modeling and simulation, an agent reasoning in an abductive mode would\nobserve state and have a number of hypotheses to explain it. It would then act using a hypothesis\n(or theory) that is as simple as possible for explanation, but no simpler [an expression of\nOccam\u2019s Razor attributed to Einstein]. The first part (as simple as possible) encourages models\nthat are more likely to be generalizable to cover new observations (Pearl, 1978). The second part\n(but no simpler) is important because, especially when data is incomplete and imperfect, it may\nbe very important to persist in using some model complexities that are rooted in knowledge or\npersuasive theory.9 Data may need to \u201ccatch up.\u201d This full process, from observations to best\n7 Charles S. Peirce discussed abductive inference (Peirce and (ed.), 1940)\n8 We recognize, of course, that many papers that have been written about how, allegedly, system models make the\nconcept of causality untenable, how \u201ceverything\u201d is correlational because we don\u2019t know the ultimate \u201ctrue\u201d theory\nif it exists, and so on. This is not the place to discuss such matters.\n9 Some 20 th century physicists noted candidly that their theoretical work, the stuff of their Nobel Prizes, sometimes\nwas driven by the \u201cbeauty\u201d of the mathematics they articulated, rather than at-the-time empirical information (Dirac,\n1939; Weinberg, 1994). At a more mundane level, some aspects of social-behavioral theory are intuitively very\npersuasive. If so, they should not be omitted without strong empirical disconfirmation. Interestingly, in DoD\u2019s\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 17\nexplanation, is a better description of what scientists do when they seek out governing laws of\nnature. The less structured process of such abductive reasoning that draws on both data and\ntheory has inhibited its automation.\nKey Questions: Are there modeling approaches that enable flexible\nexploration of alternative explanations of observations? Which analytic\ntechniques better represent the abductive process? What could it mean to\nfoster a capacity of programmable abductive model building?\nThe preceding sections discuss criteria for evaluating social simulations. It may be useful to\nexamine currently implemented social simulations through the lens of these criteria. These\nsimulations are rudimentary, but they can serve as useful caricatures of how to use data to train\nsimulation models in a theory-informed manner.\n3.4 2 Example: Modeling Belief Transmission: Memes and Related Issues at the Micro\nLevel\nThe transmission of beliefs is a social behavior of considerable interest. Belief here refers to\na unit of imitable behavior, socially shared cognition, or culture more generally. Dawkins called\nsuch a unit a meme in his 1976 book, subsequently reissued (Dawkins, 2016). Memes include\ninformation, conspiracy theories, aspects of individual identity, and even language. The flexible\nand structurally valid model of belief transmission can have significant policy relevance for\nquestions about the transmission of health, voting, radicalization, & other types of behaviors.\nBehaviors and incentives for behaviors can evolve spontaneously over time and in response\nto an individual\u2019s information diet. An important explanatory model of belief transmission sees\nan individual\u2019s or agent\u2019s beliefs and actions as a function of the beliefs and actions of members\nof the agent\u2019s social networks. Social behavior or culture propagates through social networks.\nEvery person belongs to multiple networks, but infectiousness of such memes (ideas, behaviors,\nor idioms that spread within a culture) depends on the network in which an agent encounters the\nmeme. Teenagers are more likely to adopt behaviors observed in their peer network. We can\nillustrate the phenomenon on a simple model based on social networks equipped with a\nprovisional theory of transmission.\nOur simple model draws on theories of belief fixation and the intersectional nature of\nidentity. Consider a model that is concerned with only a single binary belief. Belief fixation\nmeasures how strongly an agent\u2019s belief state resists changing when confronted with new\ninformation.10 We represent doubt about the belief using Bayesian priors. Fixation refers to how\nstrongly the agent resists changing its beliefs in light of new information. Inquiry, is the process\nmodeling of combat, many operations researchers have often omitted the factor of morale because it is difficult to\nmeasure and \u201csubjective.\u201d Senior officers, historians, as well as some modelers have recognized such practice as\nabsurd.\n10 Peirce\u2019s conception (Peirce, 1877; Peirce and (ed.), 1940) was that an agent\u2019s main goal was certainty with doubt\nbeing repugnant.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 18\nby which the agent moves from doubt to certainty. We operationalize this using the concept of\nintersectionality: an agent resolves doubt by examining the beliefs of neighboring agents in a set\nof personal networks (e.g. family, friends, workplace, & community). The strength of an agent\u2019s\nimpulse to switch belief is a weighted function of the fraction of each such network with belief\ncontrary to the agent\u2019s. This models Peirce\u2019s \u201cappeal to authority\u201d mode of changing belief; the\nauthority here is the weighted plurality of beliefs in an agent\u2019s local networks. It also reflects the\nfunction of social influence in opinion formation. In a simple agent-based simulation, then, an\nagent\u2019s belief regarding the issue in question (the meme) depends on its prior belief one time-\nstep earlier and the beliefs of the other agents in his network.11 If the initial beliefs of all agents\nare specified and the simulation is then executed, the fraction of the agents believing the meme\nwill change over time as illustrated in Figure 2.\nFor the illustration, we assumed that each agent was a member of four networks, as shown,\nthe networks being of different character. This particular simulation shows a particularly rare\nbelief/behavior (initial prevalence at 1%) spreading through the population rapidly and then\nrandomly oscillating in frequency around 45% (Figure 3). The illustrative simulation shows the\nmeme \u201ccaught on.\u201d This is the result of the parameter values assumed in the model. With other\nchoices, the meme would never catch on, or might propagate for a while and then dissipate\nagain. Thus, even this very simple model can\u2014by varying parameters\u2014generate quite a range of\nbehaviors. Conversely, if behavior is observed, then the model parameters can be inferred.12\n11 In equation terms,\n\u074c\u0bde \u073d\u0750\u0741\u0724~\u123b\u0750\u123a \u07d9\u1240\u0526 \u0bde \u0753 .\u123b\u0750\u123a\u122c\u122c\u0526 \u0d45 \u07e3. \u07dc\u0d6b\u073a \u0bde \u123a \u0750\u0d46 1\u123b\u0d6f, \u07da\u122c\u122c\u122c\u0526\u0bde \u0753 .\u123b\u0750\u123a\u122c\u122c\u0526 \u0d45 \u07e3. \u07dc\u0d6b1 \u0d46\u073a \u0bde \u123a \u0750\u0d46 1\u123b\u0d6f\u1241\nwhere\u073a  \u0bde \u074c\u0d6b\u0745\u0748\u0748\u0751\u074b\u074a\u074e\u0741\u0724~\u123b\u0750\u123a \u0bde \u123b\u0d6f\u0750\u123a,\n\u07d9 \u0bde,\u0bdd \u123a\u0750\u123b \u0d4c number of agents connected to k in the jth network who believe,\n\u07da\u0bde,\u0bdd \u123a\u0750\u123b \u0d4c number of agents connected to k in the jth network\nwho do not believe,\n\u0753\u0bdd \u0d4c relative weight or leverage of belief in the jth network\n\u0d4c \u07e3 inertia of prior belief].\n12 The illustrative model is an example of Markov Random Field (MRF) equipped with Bayesian temporal update\ndynamics. More specifically within MRFs, it is an Ising model (Br\u00e9maud, 2013).\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 19\nFigure 3 The Multiple Networks To Which Agents Belong\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 20\nFigure 4 Population Proportion of Belief as a Meme Propagates (assuming 1% initial belief)\n3.4.2.1 Evaluating the Model\nThe belief transmission model and similar such models can be useful for social and\nbehavioral modeling and simulation. This is an example of a micro-level model, specifically a\nmicro-level agent-based model (ABM). Since it revolves around a single belief, it might prove\nsimplistic when comparing it to full models of human decisionmaking. In some cases, however,\nit might be useful for exploring and building intuition about belief transmission about a particular\nmeme.\nThe question of validity is a primary concern for such models. And validity has different\ndimensions (Davis et al., 2017). The first dimension is the question of structural validity: does\nthe model actually mimic the key processes in the transmission of memes in the real world? The\nsimplicity of the model suggests that it most likely does not capture all relevant features of the\nreal process. It is an open question whether it captures enough of the relevant features. Another\ndimension is the question of replicative validity: does the model replicate overall behavior under\nidentical initial conditions? The data ecosystem may be becoming robust enough to tackle\nquestions of replicative and structural validity for this model. Social media platforms and\nCellular Data Records can provide useful estimates of both multimodal social network\nrelationships and the memes propagating through these networks. Using these data sources could\nalso enable the model to account for dynamic networks and shock events. It is thus possible, in\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nTime\nProportion of Believing Population\np\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 21\ntheory and with careful calibration, to compare meme transmission in this model to transmission\nin the real world.\nThe questions of structural and replicative validity are not synonymous for ABMs. An ABM\nmay mimic system processes closely and still fail to replicate observed macro-level system\nbehavior. And conversely, an ABM may replicate observed macro-level behavior based on\ninternal dynamics that are not identical to the true system\u2019s internal dynamics. Such mismatches\nmay be attributed to incorrect/incomplete specification of model dynamics,\nhidden/latent/unaccounted system variables, or issues of emergence (chaotic or otherwise) more\nbroadly. The question of validity for ABMs is an area of continuous research effort.\n3.4.3 Example: Static, Factor-Tree Modeling of Public Support for Terrorism\nBehavioral models may also work at a more macroscopic level. Consider, for example, a\nmodel intended to examine the factors that promote or inhibit the public support for insurgency\nand terrorism (PSOT). The macroscopic nature of the question suggests that the effective\ntheories governing the model should be macro-level to achieve a low model-inquiry gap. A large\n2009 DoD study drew on a comprehensive review of social science relating to counterterrorism\nto construct a composite qualitative model in the form of a \u201cfactor tree\u201d (a kind of primitive but\nbroad static causal model) of, e.g., public support for terrorism (Paul, 2009). A later study tested\nit empirically (qualitatively) and refined it slightly (Davis et al., 2012) (Figure 5). The work was\nsynthetic, across different fragmentary social-science theories.\nA next step (Davis and O'Mahony, 2013) went beyond the purely pictorial description to\nbuild a computational version of the factor tree, but with numerous degrees of freedom to\naccommodate different possibilities about how the factors in fact combine. That is, the model\nincorporated not just different levels of resolution as indicated in the tree, but different structures\nfor the combining relationships. The intent was to enrich the ability to discuss causal phenomena\nat a point in time. The price paid was deliberate suppression of dynamics. Although simple\nenough to present in a single page, the factor tree integrates a great deal of knowledge\u2014moving\ndiscussion away from what the alleged primary reason for public support is to the many factors\nthat affect it, with the relative significance of factors varying from one context to another as\nexpected. The same factors appeared in subsequent case studies (i.e., the qualitative theory had\nsignificant generality), but\u2014as predicted\u2014the relative significance of the factors varied with\ncase (Davis et al., 2012).\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 22\nFigure 5 A Factor Tree for Public Support for Insurgency and Terrorism\nThe computational version of the model allowed generating broad outcome maps showing\nthe circumstances (contextual variables) under which public support would be expected to be\nvery low, low, medium, high, or very high (Figure 6) (Davis and O'Mahony, 2013).\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 23\nFigure 6 An Illustrative Outcome Map Showing Public Support Versus Five Contextual\nVariables. Degree of public support is indicated by a cell\u2019s color (or number). All variables\nhave values between 0 and 10, with the points chosen having values of 1, 5, and 9.\n3.4.4 Adding Dynamics with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps\n(Osoba and Kosko, 2017) extends the simulation capacity of the Davis-O\u2019Mahony model by\nadapting the factor tree into a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM). FCMs are a type of expert system for\ncapturing and simulating causal knowledge from experts and data. Both factor trees and FCM\nmodels score high on important modeling concerns like producing interpretable and multi-\nresolution representations of systems and concepts. But FCMs have the added benefits of being\nable to:\n\u2010 flexibly represent causal dependences (even feedback or cyclic dependence),\n\u2010 fuse knowledge sources (e.g. experts and data),\n\u2010 perform data-driven automatic hypothesis generation, and\n\u2010 simulating static and dynamic what-if scenarios over short or long time horizons\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 24\nThese added benefits greatly increase the capacity for abductive model building. Analytic\nmethods like FCMs can useful for bridging the gap between theory and data for modeling and\nsimulation.\nFigure 7 A Fuzzy Cognitive Map Adding Dynamics to A Factor-Tree Model\nFigure 7 shows the graphical depiction of FCM-PSOT, the FCM adaptation of the Davis-\nO\u2019Mahony PSOT model. The FCM-POST is now directed graph (digraph) as opposed to the tree\nstructure of the PSOT. Cycles are easy to incorporate into digraphs as the figure shows. The\ndigraph\u2019s adjacency matrix combined with an appropriate signal squashing function at the nodes\n(e.g. the logistic function) allows the analyst to simulate causal progression by single time steps\nor all the way to convergence to a fixed-point or limit cycle. Progression in time on FCMs is a\nsimple matrix-vector multiplication composed with a nonlinear squashing operation on the\noutput vector.\nThe FCM\u2019s digraph structure also enables the fusion of multiple maps e.g. from separate\nexperts on the same topic. FCM fusion amounts to weighted combinations of adjacency matrices\n(augmented or zero-padded if necessary). Figure 8 shows the graphs and adjacency matrices in\nan example of such knowledge combination. The figure shows elicited maps from two experts on\nthe blood-clotting process known as \u201cVirchow\u2019s triad\u201d combining into one FCM.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 25\nFigure 8 Fusing or Combining Fuzzy Cognitive Maps\n3.4.4.1 Evaluating the PSOT Models\nPSOT and FCM-PSOT are examples of macro-level models of behavior (compared to the\nbelief transmission model). The relevant entities are populations of people, not individual agents\nor people. More specifically, the models operate on the population-level prevalence of beliefs\nand the interactions among these beliefs. The model\u2019s focus on common beliefs makes the\nvalidation process more complex. The interaction between beliefs and the more observable\nactions or events requires careful calibration in this context (and in more general contexts). The\nexisting data ecosystem currently does not (and most likely will not) inform most of the model\nvariables. We would need careful surveys and ethnographies to measure the pervasiveness of the\nrelevant beliefs or factors. Thus tests of validity (replicative or predictive) would be hard to\nimplement especially for the dynamic FCM-PSOT model.\nThe value of these models is mainly as a tool to characterize and simulate scenarios based on\ncarefully vetted expert knowledge about causal links. The correctness of the elicited expertise\nwholly underpins the structural validity of both models. The fusion capability for FCMs means\nprobabilistic limit laws guarantee the structural validity of the final FCM if a large number of\nindependent experts present individual FCMs for fusion.\nThe FCM-PSOT is an example of an AI method (an expert system) that is directly applicable\nfor social and behavioral modeling.\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 26\n4 Conclusion and Discussion Highlights\nThis discussion has outlined key changes and trends in the data and modeling environment\nsince the NRC report of 2011. The methods highlighted focused on the AI/ML domain. The data\nconversation examined the emerging ecosystem of data streams with content relevant to\nbehavioral modeling. Social media data stands out as a high-leverage stream. It is just one part of\nthe ecosystem though. The extended mind trend (in which individuals\u2019 cognition and mental\nstates leave digital footprints) suggests that the behavioral data ecosystem may be able record\nformerly unobservable useful signals.\nThe AI/ML discussion highlighted a series of innovations that could be of value to behavioral\nmodeling. The innovations seem to hold the most promise for unlocking or combining\ninformation from complex or heterogeneous data streams (e.g. language, images, video). We\ndemonstrate the value of the FCM AI approach for developing an expert system model of macro-\nlevel behavior. This suggests that older expert-system style AI methods may hold promise for\nbehavioral modeling. Alternatively, reinforcement learning may be of value to adaptive or\ndynamic agent-based models of behavior. And adversarial training may be useful for capturing\nor simulating patterns that are difficult to articulate.\nThe rest of the Working Paper focused on more fundamental questions about the interplay\nbetween theory and data in efforts to model and simulate human behavior. We identified a series\nof questions that will need answers if capacity for behavioral modeling and simulation is to\ngrow. We identified questions on:\nThe Interplay Between Data and Theory:\n1. How do we design models that are valid for purpose and representative of the relevant reality\nwhen the data and theories are unsettled? What is the right balance of theory and data focus\nin models? And what are the best practices on weaving the two together effectively?\n2. Is the social science research community able to identify which theories of social behavior\nare effective theories vs. accurate theories vs. just interesting-but-invalid theories? Is there a\nstable mechanism or framework for making this distinction? How useful is data for this\npurpose?\n3. Are there modeling approaches that enable flexible exploration of alternative explanations of\nobservations? Which analytic techniques better represent the abductive process? What could\nit mean to foster a capacity for programmable abductive model building?\nModeling Practice:\nDistribution Statement \"A\" (Approved for public release, Distribution Unlimited) 27\n4. What are the standard or best-practice approaches for equipping behavioral models with the\nkinds of heuristic decisionmaking mechanisms that humans demonstrate? When is it\nimportant to do so?\n5. When should do federated models be encouraged and, in those cases, how should they be\ndesigned and used? We are skeptical about the broad the value of model federation.\n6. Which data-driven methods are most useful for sense-making? Which methods have limited\nsense-making value (deep learning)? What would a research program focused on developing\nmethods for sense-making look like?\nCausal Inference:\n7. The data ecosystem skews strongly towards observational data collection. What is the state of\nscalable quasi-experimental methods for extracting causal relationships from observational\ndata? Are the limits of causal inference on observational data going to diminish with a larger\necosystem? Are there robust scalable ways of eliciting causal insight from experts? We\nbelieve the need for interpretable models of behavior to guide intervention makes the\ndevelopment of more capable causal modeling approaches key for useful behavioral\nmodeling.\nOur discussion ended with an exploration of rudimentary models and simulations of behavior\nat different levels of abstraction. These served as simple illustrations of the interplay between\ntheory and data driven perspectives on social and behavioral modeling. They also serve as a\nconcrete canvas on which to test our growing sophistication in evaluating behavioral models and\nsimulations.\nAcknowledgment and Disclaimer\nThis paper stems from a research project funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency.

Davis\nIntroduction\nObjectives and Scope\nGovernments intervening in post-conflict states find themselves beset\nwith numerous challenges and profound dilemmas: It is often unclear\nhow best to proceed because measures that may improve conditions\nin one respect may undermine them in another. Our study was an\nintegrative review of the scholarly social-science literature relevant to\nstabilization and reconstruction (S&R). We sought to inform strategic\nplanning at the whole-of-government level. Thus, we deal not only\nwith stability operations\u2014i.e., operations to maintain or reestablish a\nsafe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services,\nconstruct emergency infrastructure, and offer humanitarian relief\u2014\nbut also possible activities related to transition, reconstruction, and\nnation-building.\nOur research drew from such subject areas as civil wars, conflict\nresolution, conflict prevention, developmental economics, political\ndevelopment and political economy, stability operations, peacekeep-\ning, and intervention. This base reflected such disciplines as econom-\nics, political science, policy analysis, sociology, psychology, history,\nand anthropology. We also drew on practitioner-informed works by\nthe U.S. Institute of Peace, the State Department\u2019s Office of the Coor-\ndinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), foundations,\nRAND, and other civilian and military organizations.\nxvi Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nApproach\nWe took a \u201csystem view,\u201d attempting to view the entire system rather\nthan just one or another separate component. Figure S.1 is a top-level\ndepiction of the problem space.* It asserts that S&R success depends\non success in each of four component domains dealing, respectively,\nwith security, political, social, and economic issues. We treat these as\nindividually critical: Achieving some threshold level of success in each\ncomponent is necessary for overall success. Although this concept is\noften mentioned informally, we build it into analysis. Just as a military\ncommander knows that he must attend to logistics as well as to maneu-\nver, so also intervenors must attend to all of the critical components\nindicated. Further, to understand a situation or draw conclusions from\ndata, analysts need to address all of the critical components and their\nnonlinear interactions. More foreign aid to a post-conflict country, for\nexample, should be expected to do no good if the security situation is\nsufficiently abysmal.\n* Figure S.1 is a \u201cfactor tree\u201d depicting the factors that contribute to a phenomenon at a given\ntime. If one factor points to another, then more of the former will tend to increase the latter.\nThe notation \u201c~and\u201d means that, to a first approximation, some threshold values of all of the\nfactors are necessary for overall success. Such factor trees apply at a snapshot in time and do\nnot show feedback effects and other cross-factor interactions over time. Thus, they tell only\npart of the story.\nFigure S.1\nThe Four Top-Level Components and Their Interactions\nNOTE: The factors apply at a snapshot in time.\nRAND MG1119-S.1\nSocialSecurity Economic\n~and\nPolitical\n(governance)\nSuccess of stabilization\nand reconstruction\nSummary xvii\nFigure S.1 provides a static view, but the S&R challenge is\ndynamic: Over time, \u201ceverything is connected to everything,\u201d as\ndepicted in Figure S.2. This interconnectedness makes analytic work\ndifficult, but recognizing it is essential to meaningful communica-\ntion and good S&R planning. Separating the two perspectives (of\nFigures S.1 and S.2) allows us to modularize in functionally natural\nways and to reason in causal terms at a given time, while recognizing\nthat\u2014over longer periods of time\u2014interconnections are complex and\nthe usual concept of causality is troublesome. Sometimes, interactions\nare more immediate.\nA third element of our system approach is recognizing that the\neffects of an approach, or of individual factors, depend on the context,\ni.e., the situation or case. As an example, increasing intervenor troops\nto stabilize a chaotic situation (a first case) may initially be effective\nand greeted with enthusiasm, but\u2014if foreign troops become associ-\nated with occupation rather than stabilization (a second case)\u2014more\nof them may worsen a situation rather than improve it.\nAlternative courses of action, then, need to be assessed as a func-\ntion of case, perhaps as illustrated schematically by Table S.1, which\nimagines four factors. Each row would represent a different case. The\ntable also recognizes (in the last column) that, in the realm of S&R,\nFigure S.2\nOver Time, Everything Affects Everything\nRAND MG1119-S.2\nPolitical\nSecurity\nSocial\nEconomic\nxviii Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nchoosing an approach is fraught with uncertainties. Thus, the approach\nshould include hedging actions and monitoring to allow subsequent\nadaptations. This is consistent with the experience of practitioners.\nAgainst this background, the next four sections discuss the four\ncomponents of the S&R challenge. They are followed by some ana-\nlytic observations and a short set of conclusions. The full monograph\nincludes extensive references to the original literature.\nEstablishing Favorable Security Conditions\nAn Integrating Conceptual Model\nEstablishing security is a sine qua non for success in S&R: Without\nestablishing a fair degree of security first, it is nearly impossible to pro-\nceed effectively on the other fronts. Subsequently, how quickly the\nquality of security improves further will depend in part on progress on\nthe other component efforts. Although we focus primarily on what are\nnominally post-conflict interventions, some level of insurgency (resis-\ntance) may continue, and the level may escalate suddenly. Thus, deal-\ning with and deterring increases of resistance is a major part of estab-\nlishing security.\nThe scholarly literature on aspects of establishing security is frag-\nmented, but we constructed a unifying conceptual model that draws\non concepts implicit in the various literatures. Figure S.3 is a top-level\nview of the conceptual model in the form of a factor tree indicating, at\na snapshot in time, what factors affect degree of security. The values of\nthose factors can depend on previous values of the other factors.\nTable S.1\nNotional Decision Aid for Choosing Strategy as Function of Case\nCase Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Factor 4 Approach Hedges\n\u2026(many rows)\nSummary xix\nThe issue highlighted at the top of Figure S.3 is the degree of secu-\nrity. This is shown as depending primarily on the resistance effort, the\nsecurity effort, favorability of circumstances, and something we call\nthe \u201crequirements function.\u201d The resistance and security efforts depend\non the size and quality of forces, their strategy and tactics (e.g., purely\nkinetic or population-centric), their coherence, and their sustainability.\nFavorability of circumstances relates to case. For example, an insur-\ngency may be assisted by terrain that provides cover, or by the existence\nof sanctuary in neighboring countries. As indicated at the bottom left\nof the figure, both public support and external foreign support for the\nopposition are also important\u2014not just by providing resources, but\nthrough mechanisms such as tolerating the opposition\u2019s presence rather\nFigure S.3\nFactors Influencing Degree of Security\nNOTE: The factors apply at a snapshot in time.\nRAND MG1119-S.3\nDegree of security\nResistance effort\n(across factions, including\nforeign fighters)\nSecurity effort\n(government intervenors)\nSize\nQuality\nSize\nQuality\nFavorability of\ncircumstances\nfor security\nPolitical, economic,\nsocial\n\u2022 Indirect public\nsupport for\nresistance (\u2013)\n\u2022 Government\ncompetence . . .\n\u2022 International\nsupport\nPhysical\n\u2022 Area\n\u2022 Terrain\n\u2022 Safe\nhavens\n\u2022 . . .\nSustainability\nCoherence\n(across\ngovernment\nintervenors)\nStrategy\nand\ntactics\nSustainability\n\u2022 Recruits\n\u2022 Financing\n\u2022 Materiel\nCoherence\n(across\nfactions)\nStrategy\nand\ntactics\nRequirements\nfunction\n+/\u2013 +/\u2013\u2013\nInternal\nfinancing,\nsources\nExternal\nsupport\n\u2022 States\n\u2022 Diaspora\nNonstate\narms\nsuppliers +/\u2013\nCrime, lawlessness...\nOther political, economic, social factors;\nhistory; culture; exogenous events . . .\nxx Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nthan informing authorities or by arguing the case for the opposition\ninternationally.\nWe highlight the requirements function because it is currently\nunclear how much security effort is \u201cenough,\u201d even if we know how to\ncharacterize resistance and situation. This can be seen in today\u2019s opera-\ntions in Afghanistan. Historical experience suggests the need for far\nmore \u201cboots on the ground\u201d than exist currently. However, the new\ntechnology-intensive tactics may prove to be a big force multiplier. That\nhistory has not yet been written.\nFinally, along the bottom of Figure S.3 are boxes indicating fac-\ntors, such as the level of crime and lawlessness, that have cross-cutting\neffects on the factors in the tree. Some such effects may be positive or\nnegative, as indicated by a + or \u2013 symbol.\nFigure S.4 illustrates what an analytic formulation might look\nlike if knowledge were better developed. Three curves are shown for\nsubstantially different levels of resistance, but sometimes with large\nFigure S.4\nSecurity Achieved as a Function of Effort and\nResistance\nRAND MG1119-S.4\nEffective security effort\n(including local forces and police)\nDegree of security achieved\nModerate\nresistance\nHigh\nresistance\nNo or\nminimal\nresistance\nUncertainty in effects\nof strategy, tactics,\nand other factors\nSummary xxi\nuncertainties (the gray areas), reflecting uncertainties in the require-\nments function for different strategies and tactics.\nFigure S.5 addresses the key issue of whether the opposition\nchooses to resist, i.e., to restart, or escalate, conflict. Figure S.5 reflects\nboth rational-choice modeling and recognition of other factors. If fully\nrational, the opposition\u2019s leaders effectively consider the pros and cons\nof the alternatives and their probabilities. They consider not just their\n\u201cbest guesses\u201d about what would happen, but also best-case and worst-\ncase variants. For example, they may see the most likely outcome of\ncooperation (right side) as their participation in government and a\ndegree of rights and services. However, a darker possibility (risk) is that\nFigure S.5\nFactors Affecting the Decision to Renew Fighting\nNOTE: The factors apply at a snapshot in time.\nRAND MG1119-S.5\nRecruits\n+/\u2013 +/\u2013\nLikelihood of decision\nto restart conflict\nNet gains seen in\ncontinued conflict\nNet gains seen\nfor cooperating\nBeyond-\u201crational\u201d\nfactors\n\u2022 Greed, grievance\n\u2022 Weariness\n\u2022 Hope, yearnings,\nfaith\n\u2022 Inherent human\ncognitive biases\nsuch as loss-aversion\nRisk of\nlesser\ngains\n(or of\nlosses)\nUpside\npotential\n(hope)\nNet gains if\nsuccessful\n\u2022 Political power\n\u2022 Political\nimprovements\nProbability\nof success in\ncooperative\napproach\nProbability\nof success\nNet gains\nif successful\nUpside\npotential\nof conflict\nRisk of\ngreater\nlosses\n\u2013\n\u2013 Other aspects of feasibility\n\u2022 Weak opposition\n\u2022 Fragile commitment\nof intervenors\n\u2022 Public support\n\u2022 Foreign support\nArms\nMilitary feasibility\nFinancing\n\u2022 Internal\n\u2022 Diaspora\n\u2022 Lootable\nresources\nExpected\nsecurity\neffectiveness,\ngiven effort and\nvulnerabilities\nDefensibility\nSafe\nhavens\nRugged\nterrain\n+/\u2013\nValue functions, misperceptions; effects of history, culture, leaderships,\npolitical, economic, social situations; external matters . . .\n\u2013\nxxii Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nthe government will renege and repress further opposition brutally once\nthe opposition leaders come out of hiding and lay down arms. Looking\nto the option to restart conflict (left side), the opposition might expect\na long struggle with no clear-cut victory or defeat, but might also see\nthe alluring possibility of decisive victory at some point (upside poten-\ntial). However, it might see the risk that, if war starts up again, the state\nwould achieve a total victory, with no incentive for accommodation or\ninclusion; the opposition might be annihilated, not just defeated. Even\na highly rational opposition has difficulties making choices given such\nuncertainties.\nReality is even more complicated because decisions are not fully\nrational, even though most of the literature uses a rational-choice\nmodel. The blood may be running so hot that any suggestion of com-\npromise by either side\u2019s leadership will be unacceptable to its con-\nstituents. Conversely, if a leadership has the desire to fight on (or is\nmore risk-taking in nature), the rank and file may be too war-weary to\ncomply. Both practitioners and scholars refer to windows of opportu-\nnity and vulnerability.\nFinally, those making the decisions are often far more concerned with\npersonal or in group survival and power than with what might be best for\nthe people at large. Thus, even if \u201crational,\u201d leaders\u2019 actions may injure\ntheir country.\nClearly, the ability of outsiders to predict what the state or oppo-\nsition will do in a given post-conflict situation will often be quite lim-\nited. Nonetheless, this model identifies the factors and considerations\nat work.\nMeasuring the Constructs of the Security Model\nThe scholarly literature does not define how to measure the constructs\ndescribed above, but we have suggestions:\n\u2022 Degree of security can probably be measured by using an index\nvariable of the sort familiar to social scientists. Having a uniform\nstandard would allow semi-quantitative discussion good enough\nfor discussing alternative strategies.\nSummary xxiii\n\u2022 Security effort could be measured with \u201cequivalent scores\u201d reflect-\ning number of personnel, equipment and modernization, qual-\nity, and combined-arms mix. Such scoring has long been used\nfor good-enough calculations in force planning and operational\nplanning.\n\u2022 Resistance could be measured similarly, but would also need to\nreflect the differences between, e.g., active and passive support by\nthe population.\n\u2022 It might prove possible to classify situations and, for each such\ncase, reflect the effects of modern technology and tactics as \u201cmul-\ntipliers\u201d of the security and resistance efforts.\nEstablishing Favorable Political Conditions\nGeneral Observations\nThe second component of S&R noted in Figure S.1 is political, dealing\nwith establishing effective governance in a country that is at peace with\nits neighbors and responsive to the concerns of its citizens. That might\nbe accomplished in innumerable ways, but intervenors often plunge\nahead in ways reflecting their own history and ways of doing things,\nwhich can be a poor fit for the country in question for reasons of his-\ntory, culture, and circumstance.\nWhat, then, are the bare essentials? The core requirements? The\nthree most fundamental are that the government is\n\u2022 Stable: Free of internal or external threats to the nation, its consti-\ntution, and its governmental system.\n\u2022 Functioning: Able to take and implement effective decisions, pro-\nviding core services to the nation\u2019s people.\n\u2022 Legitimate and Accountable: Subject to censure or removal if offi-\ncials violate established rules, laws, and rights; and legitimate\ninternationally.\nFigure S.6 summarizes these in the form of a corresponding factor\ntree identifying general factors contributing to the quality of gover-\nxxiv Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nnance, independent of its precise form. As shown at the bottom, suc-\ncess depends also on capability, capacity, and implementation (e.g.,\nincluding control of corruption, which can infect all aspects of S&R).\nReal-world governments may fall short in some factors but still be \u201cade-\nquate\u201d in some sense. In principle, an autocratic government can be\nhigh-functioning even if it has little other political legitimacy. A demo-\ncratic government may have high legitimacy but be dysfunctional.\nA considerable degree of scholarly consensus exists on political\ngoals to be emphasized (which relate closely to the factors in Figure S.1),\nparticularly (1) dispersing benefits, (2) assuring that factions participate\nin governance and decisionmaking, (3) establishing barriers against\nexcessive centralization and exclusion, and (4) creating self-enforcing\nmechanisms to assure accountability and responsiveness. However,\nFigure S.6\nFactors Determining the Quality of Governance\nNOTES: The factors apply at a snapshot in time.

What is\nfeasible and desirable depends on the situation, including the history\nof how the war came about in the first place, root problems, and the\nnature of leaders and parties, who often operate for selfish purposes.\nSuch social-science emphasis on context dependence is sometimes dis-\nappointing to those looking for formulas, but the discussion has an\nimportant implication for intervenors:\nAn early priority should be understanding: the country\u2019s human,\neconomic, and cultural make-up; sources of contention; capac-\nities and objectives of the factions; available state-building\noptions; and an honest assessment of intervenors\u2019 commitment\nand capabilities.\nThis would be unexceptionable except that intervenors often do not\nbuild this base of information early, but rather proceed apace with\ninsufficient knowledge.\nPolitical Dilemmas\nPursuing broad goals is difficult because intervenors almost invari-\nably encounter dilemmas. Not only do they find competing \u201ctheories\u201d\nabout how to proceed, they also find that any approach taken is likely\nto have significant side effects. Table S.2 describes three conflicting\nparadigms that have been used by U.S. policymakers over the past sev-\neral decades\u2014all of which are still in play. Controlled state-building\nsees economic development as the primary engine. Liberal-democratic\nstate-building emphasizes inclusion and democratization. Decentral-\nized S&R suggests minimalist objectives overall (primarily stabiliza-\ntion) and stresses \u201cbottom-up\u201d developments in which local communi-\nties and power holders set priorities, in which case governance is more\ndistributed and local.\nxxvi Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nUpon reviewing these conflicting paradigms and a long list of\ncommon political dilemmas, we identified three composite dilemmas\nthat are common in S&R:\n\u2022 Inclusion: Should the approach emphasize short-term political\norder, which might translate into military solutions followed by\nautocracy and repression, or should it emphasize negotiated solu-\ntions that may be more inclusive and less repressive, but might\nalso be fragile and even ineffective?\n\u2022 State Capacity: Should the approach favor a strong and efficient\ncentral state, which will probably require high cost and extended\ncommitments, or should it emphasize achieving more informal\ngovernance quickly and at lower cost, but with the resulting gov-\nernment quite possibly being unable to provide services effectively?\nTable S.2\nConflicting Paradigms for Thinking About Governance Dilemmas\nParadigm Priorities\nEconomic\nConcept\nPolitical\nConcept\nSecurity\nConcept\nControlled\nstate-building\nEconomic\ngrowth,\nstate\ncapacity\nEconomics is\nengine of\nmodernization.\nDemocratization\nis the long-\nterm result\nof growth,\nbut its success\ndepends on\npreconditions.\nA strong state\nmust protect\nagainst violent\nchallenges.\nLiberal-\ndemocratic\nstate-building\nPolitical\ninclusion,\nequitable\ngrowth\nEconomic growth\nimproves\nincentives for\npeace, but only\nif equitable and\nsustainable.\nDemocratization\nis crucial to\nachieving\nstability and\nmovement\ntoward sound\nstate.\nSecurity is\nachieved through\npolitical inclusion\nand military\ntransparency.\nDecentralized\nS&R\nMinimalist\nobjectives:\nabsence of\nlarge-scale\nviolence\nLocal\ncommunities,\npower-holders\nshould set their\nown economic\npriorities.\nPolitical\ninclusion and\naccountability\nare important,\nbut may occur\noutside the\nformal state and\ndiffer between\nlocalities.\nStability is\nachieved when\nlocalities are\nsecure from each\nother and able to\nmaintain stability\nwithin their\nregions.\nSummary xxvii\n\u2022 Transition: Should the approach emphasize institutions and prac-\ntices good for securing an end to war, or institutions better suited\nto the long term, with the dilemma being that power relation-\nships created to promote an end to war tend to resist subsequent\ntransitions?\nThe dilemmas are real and no formulaic solutions exist. None-\ntheless, we can offer admonitions and suggestions, as summarized in\nTable S.3. If a relatively inclusive and legitimate state exists that exter-\nnal intervenors are willing to support, then one of the most impor-\ntant tools for stabilization is to reduce state vulnerability by reducing\nresources available to the opposition. This may require regional security\narrangements, especially when neighboring states support insurgency\nor other mischief or are part of a solution. Other mechanisms include\nbuyer cartels and neotrusteeships (i.e., governance that includes sig-\nnificant multilateral external control, as occurred in Bosnia and East\nTable S.3\nDealing with Political Dilemmas\nAdmonition\nExamples of Mechanisms for Intervenors\nto Use or Encourage\n1.

These are especially useful when\ninsurgents are using \u201clootable resources,\u201d such as oil or diamonds, to\nfund their activities.\nAchieving an appropriate power balance is often difficult (as in\ntoday\u2019s Iraq), but mechanisms include constitutional guarantees, inter-\nnational peacekeepers, and carrots and sticks to influence leaders. Early\non, power-balance issues can be crucial. The literature warns against\ncreating incentives to change facts on the ground (e.g., seizures of ter-\nritory) during negotiations. It also suggests that any incongruence\nbetween legal/constitutional dictates and those that actually apply on\nthe ground will have to be enforced by external parties, which sug-\ngests that negotiators limit their aspirations in what will be enforceable\nlater. Planning transitions is another aspect of S&R, since power bases\nchange and incentives are needed to encourage leaders, and the people\nmore generally, to join in developing institutions and activities under\nthe rule of law.\nTable S.4 suggests how strategy, including positive and negative\ninducements, might vary across cases differing in whether the external\ncircumstances for negotiated peace are favorable (e.g., are third parties\nwilling to provide guarantees; are neighboring countries supportive of\nor hostile to peace), whether the opposition is judged to be ultimately\nreconcilable, and whether the opposition enjoys broad popular sup-\nport. Table S.4 lists eight cases, defined according to these factors in\nthe leftmost four columns. In the more unfavorable cases (e.g., case 8),\nthe strategy (column 5) should focus on weakening the opponent, as\nindicated in later columns by, e.g., cutting off resources and seeking to\nwork with other regional states. It might also include (not shown) look-\ning for ways to improve reconcilability (e.g., wait for a change of leaders\nor objective realities as seen by the opposition leader). In more favorable\ncases, some aspects of the intervenor\u2019s approach may be straightfor-\nward, but others less so. For example (cases 5 and 6, in which regional\ncircumstances may not be favorable), it may be necessary to provide\n\u201cphysical\u201d guarantees by maintaining international peacemakers or\nguaranteeing intervention to enforce the protections that are essential\nin enticing the opposition to pursue peace. We see Table S.4 as the\nsketch of a tentative framework for making distinctions and commu-\nSummary xxix\nTable S.4\nA First Attempt to Suggest Political Strategies by Case Characteristics\nCase\nFavorable\nEnvironment\nReconcilable\nOpposition\nBroad Support\nof Opposition\nStrategy\nInducements\nPositive Negative\nInclusion Protections Economic Resources Military\nFaction\nEngineering\n1 Yes Yes Yes Find accommodative\nsolution\nCooptation\nwith soft\nguarantees\n2 Yes Yes No Find solution;\ninclude reasonable\nincentives\nTransparency;\npolitical\nmechanisms\nSome side\npayments\nSqueeze\n3 Yes No Yes Weaken opposition;\nseparate from its base\nCut off\n4 Yes No No Weaken opposition Cut off Defeat via\nsecurity\ncooperation\n5 No Yes Yes Improve environment;\nfind solution\nStructural\nguarantees\nPhysical Some side\npayments\n(not\npersonal)\nCut off Defeat\n6 No Yes No Improve environment;\nfind solution\nStructural\nguarantees\nPhysical Some side\npayments\nSqueeze\n7 No No Yes Improve environment;\nweaken opposition\nCut off\n8 No No No Improve environment;\nweaken opposition\nCut off Defeat via\nsecurity\ncooperation\nxxx Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nnicating, although it will often be very difficult even to know which\ncase applies. Is the opposition really irreconcilable as it claims? Are the\npromises of a neighboring state credible or mere deviousness? Such\nproblems are visible today in Afghanistan and related negotiations with\nPakistan and Iran. In any case, constructs such as a more fleshed-out\nversion of Table S.4 could be helpful in guiding discussion, although\nthey would at best sharpen issues rather than resolve them.\nLooking back to Table S.3, its last item deals with another cross-\ncutting dilemma, whether to encourage and work through a central-\nized government or instead deal with decentralized elements of gov-\nernance, including relatively informal versions where local customs\nand processes are a part of governance. Choices must be case-specific.\nIn Afghanistan, for example, the central government has always been\nweak, with most governance being local and sometimes informal.\nWorking with local leaders has many advantages, such as reduced costs\nand encouraging a bottom-up development of leaders and governance\nthat can bring with it legitimacy. However, it is more difficult to deal\nwith multiple leaderships; there are reasons for favoring a strong state,\nsuch as improving ability to defend against neighbors and economies\nof scale; and local governance may seem less desirable and benign if\nit comes with a tradition of discrimination or abuse of minorities or\nwomen, criminal control, or highly intolerant religious interpretations\n(as with the Taliban). Thus, the dilemma is nontrivial. Table S.5 sum-\nmarizes some of the pros and cons of working through informal gov-\nernance mechanisms.\nEstablishing Favorable Social Conditions\nInitial Observations\nThe third component of our system structure deals with social matters.\nThe social component is dismayingly broad and notoriously difficult\nto affect, especially for intervenors. Regrettably, we were unable in our\nstudy to deal in depth with such issues as the implications of tribal\ncompetition, corruption, or organized crime. Instead, we focused on\nthe importang but more humble challenge of achieving a degree of trust\nSummary xxxi\nand cooperation among disputing factions in a culturally appropriate\nmanner. As noted repeatedly in the scholarly literature, achieving a\ndegree of trust and cooperation is essential for success (not just a nice-\nto-have objective pursued by idealists)\u2014and can be feasible despite\npast history. A great deal is known from social science about how to\nproceed, and\u2014significantly\u2014about pitfalls and naivet\u00e9s to avoid.\nA starting point is recognizing the different types of trust, as sum-\nmarized in Table S.6, which fall into two broad categories: \u201ccalculation-\nbased trust\u201d and \u201crelationship-based trust.\u201d The former requires only\nthat each party concludes that the other can be trusted on a specific\nmatter because it is in its interests to cooperate. Relationship-based\ntrust is different, and grows with improved understanding and the\ndiscovery of some common concerns and goals. Both kinds of trust\nimprove over time with positive experiences and, of course, suffer from\nnegative experiences.\nDistrust is more than the lack of trust. Not trusting someone has a\npassive connotation. Active distrust is characterized by fear, skepticism,\nand vigilance. Even if the level of trust is low, if the more active sense\nof distrust can be reduced, then dealings among people may include\nformal courtesies and arms-length interactions, whereas if the level of\nTable S.5\nWorking Through Informal Institutions of Governance\nStrengths of\nInformal Institutions\nWeaknesses of\nInformal Institutions\nChallenges Faced\nby Foreigners\nAdapted to local realities\nInexpensive, immediately\navailable\nStrong and resilient\nCan be part of bottom-up\nlegitimization of leaders\nand institutions\nInefficiencies of scale\nWeaknesses in regulating\ninter-communal conflict\nInequality\nDegradation of traditional\nauthority over years of\nfighting\nVariation between\nlocalities\nVisibility\nTraining, experience of\ninternational personnel\nScale, personnel required\nfor decentralized\noperations\nPotential incongruence\nwith policy goals\nPotential incongruence\nwith human rights\nstandards\nxxxii Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\ndistrust is high, there may be active fear, paranoia, and the perceived\nneed to attack preemptively.\nPrescriptions for Trust-Building\nFigure S.7 summarizes a great deal of social science on how to build\ndegrees of trust and cooperation. Doing so includes orchestrating suc-\ncessful contacts and joint activities, building familiarity with each oth-\ner\u2019s concerns and narratives, creating structural and other incentives\nfor at least limited cooperation, and providing education that encour-\nages understanding and toleration while undercutting hatred and neg-\native stereotypes. Even modest progress on these matters can have large\neffects well before trust is deep and enduring. This said, much can\ngo wrong with poorly designed efforts. Contact and the experience of\ntrying to work together can, for example, deepen hostilities and rein-\nforce prejudices.\nTable S.6\nTypes of Trust\nCalculation-Based Trust Relationship-Based Trust\nSource\nof trust\nIntendedly rational calculations of\nothers\u2019 self-interest\nExperiential history of interactions\nIdentification with others by\nrelationship and association\nSome emotional attachment, even\nempathy\nActors\u2019\nfocus\nBehavior control with incentives\nand enforcement mechanisms\nInformation-gathering about\nmotives and actions\nIdentifying common goals\nBuilding positive familiarities\nEngaging in emotional reciprocity;\nencouraging empathy\nWays to\ndevelop\nEducation\nClear, consistent\ncommunication\nCredible commitments\nRepeated, equal-status interactions\nwith appropriate incentive\nstructures\nCollaborative projects\nEmphasizing commonly held\nidentities, values, and goals\nEducation about each others\u2019\nhistories, narratives, and travails\n(empathy-building)\nSummary xxxiii\nEstablishing Favorable Economic Conditions\nWhy Post-Conflict Economics Is Different\nThe last of our four components (from Figure S.1) is economic. The\neconomic dimensions of S&R are numerous, complex, and ridden with\nwhat are or often appear to be dilemmas. Figure S.8 is a general factor-\ntree depiction of what contributes to a healthy economy. As indicated\nat the bottom, economic health also depends on security, governance,\nand social conditions. This depiction could apply to either post-conflict\nor normal development settings, but with differences relating to the\nrelative intensity of effort on different factors, the sequencing of those\nefforts, the type of aid employed, and the type of market system used.\nFor a given country, some of the branches will be much more problem-\natic than others. Thus, Figure S.8 is useful for seeing the whole, but not\nfor deciding what approach to take.\nFigure S.7\nFactors Affecting Intergroup Trust and Cooperation\n+/\u2013+/\u2013\n+/\u2013\nNOTE: The factors apply at a snapshot in time.\nRAND MG1119-S.7\nFavorable history\nIdentities\nTrust and\ncooperation\nCalculation-based trust\n(~rational trust)\nRelationship-based trust\n(~identity-based trust)\nFavorable structural/\nenvironmental factors\nPositive social\nconstructions\nGuarantees\n\u2022 3rd party\n\u2022 Other\nIncentives for\ncooperation\nEnforcements\n\u2022 Justice\n\u2022 Rule of law\n\u2022 Enforceable\npenalties\nFrequency of\ncooperation\nQuality of\ncooperations\nOutgroup\nstereotypes\nand biases\nPositive\ncontacts\nPeace-\nsupporting\neducation\nCulture\n\u2022 History\n\u2022 Narrative\nCircumstances, perceptions, personalities,\nother; mechanisms for cooperation\n\u2013\n\u2013 \u2013\nxxxiv Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nIndeed, perhaps the most important conclusion from our review\nis, bluntly,\nEconomists seeking to advise in post-conflict circumstances must\nadjust their thinking substantially: The usual paradigms of \u201cgood\neconomics\u201d are counterproductive.\nThe differences between normal and post-conflict economics have\nbeen at the heart of bitter disagreements over the years between some\ndevelopment economists on the one hand and the World Bank and\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on the other. Often, policies have\nincluded immediate and unremitting fiscal and monetary austerity\u2014\nincluding not printing money, cutting public spending, setting high\ninterest rates, and constraining credit\u2014all of which can keep inflation\ndown and decrease debt. For a post-conflict situation, however, interve-\nFigure S.8\nFactors Contributing to Economic Health\nNOTE: The factors apply at a snapshot in time.\nRAND MG1119-S.8\nReliable currency\nRevenues\nFiscal policy\nBanking system\nCentral bank\nHuman capital\nDevelopment\nands\nLong-term economic health\nSpending\ndiscipline\nMonetary\npolicy\nNetwork of\nregional and\nlocal banks\nLaws\n\u2022 Rule of law\n\u2022 Reliable,\nconsistent\nregulation Education\nIncentives\nto attract\nappropriate\nnonstate\ninvestment\nOther\nstate\ninvestment\nFull use of\npotential\nwork force\n\u2022 All groups\n\u2022 Women\n. . .\n\u2022 Physical\n\u2022 Market\nmechanisms\n\u2022 Investment in\ntechnology\nInfrastructure\nfor commerce\nInvestment\nand investment\nincentives\nForeign investment\nForeign aid\nSecurity, political stability, and\nadequate social conditions\nSummary xxxv\nnors must worry first about the short run; they want to see that people\nhave incomes so that money can start flowing through the system. The\nactions may seem to be \u201cpolitical\u201d and be perceived negatively by some,\nbut the principle is that the best economics in a post conflict situation is\nheavily political and social. Jump-starting the economy is the primary\nobjective, although laying the foundations for sound longer-term eco-\nnomics is also essential. Table S.7 summarizes differences between eco-\nnomics for normal development and for post-conflict settings. Theory\nand data agree on these matters, and consensus is emerging among\ndevelopment economists even though battles continue more broadly.\nIn recent times, even the World Bank and IMF have relaxed their strin-\ngent austerity policies in some post-conflict situations.\nEconomic Practices for the Post-Conflict Situation\nEconomic strategy must reflect country-specific circumstances and his-\ntory, but the literature supports some overarching themes, which are\nmeaningful because so much past practice has violated the correspond-\ning principles:\nTable S.7\nEconomic Planning in Normal Versus Post-Conflict Development\nEconomic Planning in\nNormal Development\nEconomic Planning in\nPost-Conflict Circumstances\nFocus is on medium- and long-term\ngoals.\nFocus must often be on short-term\n(potentially distortionary) emergency\nprograms.\nChoices are largely merit-based,\nwithout regard to group affiliations.\nChoices must often include preferential\nefforts to assist groups affected by\nconflict and by social inclusion policies.\nForeign assistance is low and stable. Foreign assistance spikes immediately\nafter conflict, varying thereafter.\nGovernment institutions establish and\ncarry out rule of law.\nForeign troops support or possibly replace\nweak or nonexistent government\ninstitutions (e.g. police, army, judiciary)\nto promote rule of law.\nInternational community need not\ninvolve itself in the country\u2019s politics.\nInternational involvement in country\npolitics is often intrusive and intense.\nxxxvi Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nExpectations. Expectations are a problem. Too often, those\ninvolved in S&R set high goals, not realizing that doing so undercuts\npolitical support and diminishes the government. The more realistic\ndescription for the short term would be jump starting. What is needed\nmost is to get the engine started and to establish attitudes of respon-\nsible local ownership.\nMeasures. An important element of action should be collecting\nand analyzing data to help assess whether progress is greater where\njump-starting actions are employed. This can help both in manage-\nment and in building support for the activities, individuals, and insti-\ntutions responsible. When the actions are not making a positive differ-\nence, adaptations may be needed. Metrics are important, of course, but\nshould be developed within a system framework because more narrow\nmetrics will often have very troublesome side effects.\nSimplicity and Flexibility. The need for \u201csimplicity\u201d is often men-\ntioned, almost as a clich\u00e9. However, the admonition has substantial\ncontent. Strategy should not have too many components and, certainly,\nshould not try to drive too many factors or be sensitive to intricate\ninterconnections and subordinate controls. \u201cMoving in the right direc-\ntion\u201d along several lines of effort and \u201cdoing essential coordination\u201d\nconveys the idea. Complex orchestration, as is common and necessary\nfor efficiency in modern commercial settings, is the opposite. Simplic-\nity can also improve transparency and increase buy-in and support by\nlocal stakeholders. Finally, plans need to be flexible, so that if activities\nare not working (as will often be the case), this fact will be recognized\nand adaptations can be made. Measures to identify failure and enable\nsmooth changes need to be planned and agreed on in advance. This\nis easier when plans are simple. Interestingly, these themes will all be\nfamiliar to military commanders who deal with analogous issues in\ntheir traditional domain.\nFigure S.9 summarizes how priorities and intensity of effort might\nreasonably change between the short, mid, and long terms. We see this\nstructuring of priorities over time as resolving some of the apparent\ndilemmas in the economic component of S&R: Some issues are not so\nmuch true dilemmas as conflicts of competing theories due to failures\nto distinguish sharply among time periods.\nSummary xxxvii\nSpecial Issues of Foreign Aid\nSpecial economic issues arise with respect to foreign aid because of\nnumerous tensions:\n\u2022 short-term versus longer-term objectives\n\u2022 traditional versus more stabilization-specific objectives\n\u2022 strengthening government by funneling aid through it and allow-\ning the related buildup of patronage systems versus improving the\nefficiency of aid by delivering directly to the population\n\u2022 strengthening central government and improving some kinds of\nefficiency by working through that central government versus\nemphasizing bottom-up developments at the local and province\nlevels\n\u2022 imposing conditionalities to improve national performance versus\nattending quickly to urgent needs.\nTable S.8 is our effort to resolve the tensions. The conflict between\nshort-term and long-term issues is less of a dilemma than a matter of\ndiagnosing problems and recognizing what is feasible for the particu-\nlar country at the particular time: It matters, for example, whether the\nFigure S.9\nSummary of Priorities Over Time\nTiming\nEarly Mid-Term Later\nIntensity\nHigh\nSecurity\nGood use of\npost-conflict\nsecurity aid\nHuman-capital\ndevelopment\nRevenue\ncollection\nIncentives\nto attract\ninvestment\nMedium\nPhysical\ninfrastructure\nEducation\nRule of law\nRebuilding\ncentral bank\nNetwork of\nregional banks\nLow\nFull assessment\nof available\nworkforce\nFiscal policy Monetary policy\nRAND MG1119-S.9\nxxxviii Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\ncountry has suffered grievous damage and whether it had or still has a\nsubstantial base of human capital.\nThe tension between traditional development and stabilization-\nspecific objectives is sometimes very troublesome, but one element of\nmitigating the tensions is to improve the way in which different organs\nof government and different agencies relate to each other and to non-\ngovernment organizations (NGOs). Military-style \u201ccommand and\ncontrol\u201d is most unlikely, but much more coordination, collaboration,\nand even integration may be possible.\nA fundamental issue\u2014sometimes a dilemma and sometimes just\na difficult issue to diagnose and deal with\u2014is whether to support and\nstrengthen the central government (a natural tendency for the United\nStates and other developed-country intervenors) or to take the approach\nof strengthening governance from the bottom up by working through\nlocal leaders. Which approach is better will depend on the specific case,\nbut a cross-cutting principle is that\nWhichever strategy is adopted, implementation should support\nleaders at all levels who actually provide services to their people.\nTable S.8\nReconciling Tensions\nTension Resolution\nShort term versus long term Base relative emphasis on starting conditions.\nTraditional versus\nstabilization-specific\nobjectives\nImprove the collaboration and the integration of the\ndifferent development aid agencies.\nStrengthening government\nfrom the bottom up by\nbuilding patronage systems\nversus strengthening central\ngovernment\nBuild the credibility and the legitimacy of the\ngovernment, e.g., encourage concrete and\nobservable actions.\nImposing conditionalities\nor not doing so in the\ninterest of speed\nFocus conditionalities on matters uniquely important\nto leaders, while not putting at risk matters\nimportant to the population at large, e.g., exclude\nconditionality on humanitarian activities.

Such leaders will use or build networks of people that\nthey trust to get things done. Such leaders should be chosen by\nthe people, however, not by the intervenor.\nInterestingly, this approach might be seen as building \u201cpatron-\nage networks\u201d in a pejorative sense, with elements that might be seen\nas cronyism. However, it should also be seen positively as establish-\ning patronage networks with bottom-up \u201cemergence\u201d of talented,\ndedicated, networked people strengthening the core of the nation.\nIntervenors should influence leaders to be inclusive as they build their\nnetworks.\nConditionalities are another common source of dispute. Con-\ncerns such as fears of corruption or exclusion lead donor countries to\nset requirements to assure that their assistance is well used. However,\nthese conditionalities often have bad effects on the people. The primary\nadmonition is that conditionalities should be focused on influencing\nleaders while not interfering with immediate humanitarian efforts.\nConditions should often be tied to institution-building.\nThe last of Table S.8\u2019s issues has to do with the tension mentioned\nin earlier paragraphs, whether to work through the government or act\nmore directly. We conclude that the issue is one of correct diagnosis,\ni.e., in identifying the relevant case. As indicated in Table S.9, very dif-\nferent approaches are suggested merely by recognizing the quality and\ncapacity of the government. If both are lacking (case 1), direct delivery\nmakes sense, especially for short-term humanitarian relief. At the other\nextreme (a government with relatively high quality and capacity, as in\ncase 4), every effort should be made to work through the government\nrather than undercutting and delegitimizing it, and rather than setting\nup ad hoc processes without the benefit of local knowledge and exper-\ntise. For in-between cases, hybrid strategies are appropriate, along with\nadaptation. Intervenor resources may supplement government forces\nbut be clearly in an assistance role. In the event of rank incompetence\nor total corruption, however, a more direct role is called for. This typol-\nxl Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nogy is simple but nontrivial, because intuition is often wrong and pres-\nsures are often mischievous.\nAnalytic Observations\nMost of our study was organized around the four components of S&R\nfrom Figure S.1, but in addressing those we reviewed a great deal of\nanalytical literature and, in the course of doing so and making our\nown assessments, we reached a number of conclusions significant in\ntheir own right.\nWe drew heavily on the empirical literature. Empirical evidence,\nhowever, comes in many forms, such as case histories, more-than-\nanecdotal practitioner accounts, and statistical-empirical analysis.\nEach has strengths and weaknesses. We usually found case histories to\nbe the most useful because they provide rich contextual information\nand identify \u201creal\u201d factors rather than the variables that happen to be\nconvenient for data analysis. Ultimately, as illustrated in recent years\nby prominent researchers, there is great opportunity to combine case-\nhistory information and quantitative analysis in research, but that is\nquite demanding.\nTable S.9\nRelating Donor Strategy to Quality and Capacity of Governance\nCircumstances Response\nCase\nGovernance\nQuality\nGovernance\nCapacity\nDonor Strategy\u2019s\nRelative Emphasis Nature of\nDonor ActionsShort-Term Long-Term\n1 Low Low \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022 Direct to people\n2 High Low \u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022 Direct to people; but\ngovernment presence\nand guidance\n3 Low High \u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022 Through government\nif possible; direct if\nnecessary\n4 High High \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 Through government\nNOTE: Number of bullets indicates weight of emphasis.\nSummary xli\nIt is appropriate to comment specifically on statistical-empirical\nwork because of a common misperception that it is more rigorous and\npolicy-relevant than is the case. Some even equate it with \u201cevidence-\nbased research.\u201d In fact, we (and the strongest articles of the litera-\nture) are especially reluctant to draw policy conclusions from the past\nstatistical-empirical work relating to S&R. The reasons are many. First,\nmuch of the work has been overly \u201cmacro\u201d in nature and dependent on\nhistorical data that did not stem from the controlled experiments to\nwhich the methods apply. After a decade of study and counterstudy, it\nis clear that much of the analysis has been afflicted by hidden variables,\nendogeneity, \u201ccoding issues,\u201d and a sensitivity of results to the detailed\nform of equations used for the statistical analysis (the so-called \u201cspec-\nification problem\u201d). We find that very few results about the relative\nimportance of factors have held up well across analyses. Where a factor\nhas been shown to correlate with past results, the correlation has often\nnot been truly causal. Further, where a factor has not correlated with\npast results, we find that has not necessarily meant much. For example,\nforeign aid has often not had hoped-for effects, but the aid may have\nbeen wasted because of poor security, governance, or implementation\nthat precluded its usefulness. In summary, the rich back-and-forth in\nthe quantitative-analysis literature has been very helpful and insight-\nful in identifying factors, influences, and issues, but not very useful in\nassessing the relationships among factors or their strengths.\nDespite these cautions, past \u201cnegative\u201d empirical results from\nquantitative analysis (i.e., an instrument didn\u2019t seem to help) should be\nextremely sobering to those advocating the use of a particular instru-\nment. If the instrument has not been effective previously, then why\nshould it be more valuable this time? What will be different\u2014and\neven if there are differences (and there always are), why should they be\nthought to be so important as to lead to different results? The salience\nof this admonition was illustrated in the Iraq war and its aftermath.\nIllustrative Results\nAs noted above, many factors have been studied for their potential\nvalue in statistical prediction of war occurring or, given a cessation of\nwar, of peace persisting. Most conclusions have proven soft after suc-\nxlii Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\ncessive studies and critiques, but much has been learned. Table S.10\nis our selected abstraction from the literature that illustrates some of\nthe issues. Looking at the first row of the table, an early conclusion\nwas that prospects for peace have been best when the previous war\nended decisively, an intuitively sensible conclusion with troublesome\npolicy implications. Further study, however, has shown that \u201cdecisive-\nness\u201d is too aggregated. Some analyses indicate that when rebels have\nwon decisively, prospects have been better than if the government won\n(perhaps because the governments in question had problems that per-\nsisted). Other studies find a different result (using a wider set of cases,\nincluding cases with fewer casualties and less destruction), so the only\nconclusion is probably that who wins matters. Significantly, analysis\nindicates that intervention by external peacekeepers can trump the sig-\nTable S.10\nWhat Affects Prospects for Enduring Peace? (illustrative)\nTheory/Hypothesis Statistical Evidence Illustrative Complications\nDecisive conclusion to\nwar\nYes, but Not necessary. Also, decisive for\ngovernment or for rebels? Details\nmatter. Further, interventions by\nan external power can trump this\nfactor.\nMobilization along\nethnic lines\nYes, perhaps, but Ethnicity is probably not \u201croot cause\u201d\nbut manufactured rallying point;\ndoes it matter?\nAbsolutist objectives Yes, but Factions routinely exaggerate\ntheir firmness or hide their real\nintentions, or both.\nIntervention and\nguarantees by\nexternal power\nYes (about as strong\nas it gets), but\nNot all guarantees are equally\ncredible, nor all interventions\nequally well sustained.\nRegime type/political\ninstitutions (degree of\ndemocratization)\nYes Civil wars has been less likely with\nmore democratic governments,\nbut reoccurrence in a post-war\nenvironment has been more\nlikely with a factionalized partial\ndemocracy\nCutting off\nopposition\u2019s resources\nYes, but Constraints on government can also\nhelp.\nNOTE: Bold indicates items with persuasive and policy-relevant significance.\nSummary xliii\nnificance of the previous war\u2019s decisiveness. Such scientific back-and-\nforth is quite valuable for understanding factors and issues.\nLooking to the second row, has ethnic hatred been a major factor?\nBy and large, the conclusion from a combination of evidence is that\nethnicity has not been a root cause, but rather a manufactured ral-\nlying point exploited by demagogues. Unfortunately, once a war has\nbeen fought with mobilization organized along ethnic lines, the ethnic\nfactors become independently significant. The existence of absolut-\nist objectives has also been studied and found significant. However,\nit should surprise few readers that factions are sometimes more will-\ning to compromise than their rhetoric suggests and that, other times,\npeace-seeking language disguises more malevolent intentions. The last\nthree items in Table S.10 (shown in bold) are those that we found had\npersuasive and policy-relevant significance. Intervention and guaran-\ntees by external powers have been correlated in the past with success,\nwhich makes sense from theoretical considerations. If a faction is con-\ntemplating a negotiated peace, it will be more willing to take risks if\nthere is some credible guarantor to step in if necessary and use its influ-\nence more generally to protect the faction\u2019s interests. Continuing in\nthe table, recent research provides strong evidence that, with a good\nspecification, regime type is a strong statistical indicator of when civil\nwars occur. Again, that is consistent with theoretical considerations.\nIt is also encouraging because regime type is something that can be\ninfluenced. However, another part of the conclusion is that partial,\nhighly factionalized democracies\u2014not uncommon in a post-conflict\nsituation\u2014are especially fragile. Finally, we mention cutting off the\nopposition\u2019s resources. If the intervenor supports the government (per-\nhaps a newly formed government), then a major issue from the lit-\nerature is that the opposition may well continue fighting if it has the\nresources to do so. Both logic and statistical data support the idea that\ncutting off such resources can be valuable.\nxliv Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nConclusions and Suggestions for Future Research\nWe conclude from our work that the \u201csystem view\u201d is both necessary\nand helpful. The potential value of intervenor options depends on base-\nline values of the security, political, social, and economic components;\non the direct ways in which the proposed options can affect them; and\non indirect effects (sometimes called second- and third-order effects).\nPlanners can benefit from having concepts of virtuous self-reinforcing\nloops, as in the illustrative influence diagram in Figure S.10, where\nprogress in each component positively influences developments in\nanother. In the particular example (only one of many that could be\nFigure S.10\nVirtuous, Reinforcing Cycles\nRAND MG1119-S.10\nEconomic\nSecuritySocial\nPolitical and legal actions\npromote growth\nCooperative\npower-sharing,\ninclusiveness,\nfair institutions\ncalm tensions\nInclusion can\npromote security\nCivil society,\nengaged\ncommunities\ncontribute\nto public\ndiscourse\nInclusive economic\ngrowth promotes\npolitical stability\nEconomic stability\ndecreases competition\nfor resources, violence,\nand security burdens\nSecurity\ndecreases\neconomic\nrisk\nGrowth promotes\nsocial exchange\nSocial capital\nhelps growth\nPolitical\nSocial capital and\ntrust reduces need for\nmonitoring and security\nSecurity decreases risk\nand improves\nlaw enforcement\nmechanisms\nSummary xlv\ndrawn), levels of self-reinforcing intergroup cooperation can help estab-\nlish a norm of cooperation in political circles, which reduces the likeli-\nhood of stalemate, thereby increasing government effectiveness. That\nin turn reduces risk and increases cooperative behavior. Also, effec-\ntive establishment of transitional justice can legitimize a new govern-\nment (at the possible cost of exacerbating residual tensions with the\nsociety). Civil-society organizations can partner with government to\nprovide human services guided by government to increase social capital\nvia service delivery as well as perceptions of state capacity. Conversely,\npolitical corruption decreases trust in all levels of society, both hori-\nzontally and vertically. Political structures that encourage nepotism or\nfavoritism create disincentives to cooperation, which in turn decrease\neconomic opportunity, which creates more competition, and so forth.\nRegrettably, the possibilities here work in both directions. Fail-\nure in one component can undercut progress in others. Side effects are\ncommon. Moreover, most of the virtuous feedback effects do not occur\nautomatically, but must rather be planned for and enforced. That can\nbe difficult to achieve when the parties in question (e.g., a government\nand a prime opposition party) are led by individuals or groups of indi-\nviduals driven more by personal ambitions, greed, and power consider-\nations than by concern for the people at large.\nAnalytically, we see much value in \u201cinfluence-diagram\u201d depic-\ntions for understanding potential effects and side effects, especially for\nreasoning and communication. Many authors over the years (primar-\nily in other domains, including policy analysis and business planning)\nhave reached similar conclusions. We emphasize that the greatest value\nis in \u201cseeing\u201d the relationships, not literally building computer models\nthat generate \u201cpredicted\u201d results over time. Such models could be quite\nvaluable for exploratory analysis, which in the future could provide\nuseful analytic insights about prospects for success and about possible\nside effects to plan against, but for now the more qualitative influence\ndiagrams (and factor trees presented earlier) are the most useful.\nOperations as Experiments\nBecause of the uncertainties and complications discussed above, those\ndeveloping strategy for S&R will be well advised to think of the chosen\nxlvi Dilemmas of Intervention: Social Science for Stabilization and Reconstruction\nstrategy as an experiment, one that will probably have to be adapted\nto reinforce what is working and to find substitutes for what does\nnot. This requires monitoring developments, which requires signposts\nof success or failure. Metrics can either help or hurt in this regard,\ndepending on how well they are constructed and how well they reflect\nthe idiosyncratic nature of the particular intervention. We believe that\nimproved metrics can be constructed using the results of our survey\nand its system depictions (including competing influence diagrams\nthat represent differences of expert opinion).\nIntervernors are also likely to discover that the problems they are\naddressing are what theorists call \u201cwicked\u201d problems. At the outset,\nthere is no unique solution to be found by merely applying an algo-\nrithm: Antagonists do not yet know what they will, in the end, find\nsatisfactory; objective factors, such as the economy\u2019s development, are\nnot yet realistically predictable; the quality and motives of emergent\nleaders are yet to be determined; and what intervenors and the world\ncommunity will find it possible to sustain will be dictated by future\nand partially unpredictable events. When dealing with wicked prob-\nlems, process is important so that, if the stars align themselves properly,\nan adequate solution can emerge in due course.\nSuggestions for Research\nResearch in S&R will continue, and we offer some suggestions:\n\u2022 Reject narrow approaches to \u201cevidence-based research\u201d that\ndepend strictly on quantitative methods. A mix of methods is a\nstronger approach to using empirical information. Qualitative\nmethods, particularly case studies and comparative case studies,\nare often more insightful.\n\u2022 Within quantitative work, increase emphasis on \u201cmicro-level\u201d\nquantitative analysis in a single country, so as to hold more con-\ntextual elements more or less constant.\nSummary xlvii\n\u2022 Disaggregate to recognize different phases or regions within a\nsingle country as substantially different cases.\n\u2022 Commission experiments in operational theaters large enough to\npermit using different instruments in different areas or time peri-\nods; use people trained in quasi-experimental methods to design\nmeaningful efforts.*\n\u2022 Support further work with \u201cagent-based rational-choice\ndecisionmaking models\u201d to anticipate (and in some cases even\npredict) the maneuverings of political factions competing for\ninfluence by forging alliances.\n\u2022 Encourage quantitative analyses that are more theory-informed\nin a system-theory sense, rather than based on traditional linear\nregression and minor variants. Develop a new approach to metrics\naccordingly.\n\u2022 Adapt the methods of multiresolution modeling and exploratory\nanalysis to social-science analysis on S&R.\n* Although adding complexity to their efforts, operational commanders could see this as a\nportfolio approach to managing risk, one offering an empirical basis for reinforcing success-\nful approaches. Although we recommend such experiments, we caution against high expec-\ntations because data will often prove too sparse for the number of factors at play.",

We\u2019re still at it, working with ever\nmore sophisticated approaches and for increasingly important outcomes.\nMy own experience in this area started out when I was working at NASA to\nhelp design an autopilot for the Space Shuttle vehicle. It worked great when\nthere was no astronaut in the loop, but when they started wrangling the con-\ntrols themselves, the astronauts were not exactly enamored with my design\nand the way it behaved. Dismay would be a word that might apply here, but\nI went back to school to figure out why and soon became enmeshed in trying\nto understand human self-motion perception and control, by bringing together\nestablished theory, controlled experimentation, and computational modeling.\nIt was an eye-opener on how complicated even the simplest of human behav-\niors could be, as well as the beginning of a long foray into developing and using\ncomputational models in this arena.\nOf course, as I later discovered, there\u2019s a long history of this, perhaps going\nas far back as the 1880s with Ernst Mach and his pioneering work in visual and\nvestibular psychophysics and certainly at least the 1940s to Norbert Weiner\nwith his introduction of cybernetics and the mathematical modeling of both\nhumans and machines. Since then, many other disciplines have contributed\nand elaborated on this idea, from the basic sciences of neurophysiology and\ncognitive science to the more applied efforts in human systems engineering and\nrobotics. Moving into the domain of computational representation has forced\nmany of us to sharpen our approach to describing behaviors, formalizing our\ntheories, and validating them against real data. As one of my mentors once\ntold me (and I paraphrase a bit here): \u201cThe rubber hits the road when you start\nhacking code.\u201d\nThis movement by the research community has been documented in a\nnumber of efforts. In 1998, the National Research Council (NRC) published\na review of potential models that might be usefully embedded in existing\nmilitary simulations to provide greater realism by including the humanDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The report concluded that there\nwas no single framework or architecture that could meet all the simulation\nneeds of the services, but it did provide an extensive review of computational\nbehavioral models, in-depth discussions of different functional areas (e.g.\nattention, memory, learning, etc.), and considerations for small unit represen-\ntation (i.e. groups of individuals). A follow-on NRC study in 2008 provided a\nsomewhat broader review, covering models of not only individuals but also\norganizations and societies (National Research Council 2008). This study also\ndiscussed different categories of models \u2013 both formal and informal \u2013 and\ncommon challenges across the community (e.g. interoperability, inconsistent\nframeworks, verification, etc.). And, like almost all NRC reports of this ilk,\nthere were a number of recommendations proposed, in this case, covering\nareas from basic theory development to data collection methods and tools for\nmodel building.\nAlthough many insights from these and other studies remain relevant,\nmuch has happened in the last decade, in terms of new basic research results,\nnew applications afforded by the acceleration of technology (particularly\nin sensing, networking, computation, and memory), and, not least, a resur-\ngence of a general interest in natural and artificial cognition, with the recent\nreemergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, on\nthe basic research side, a revolution in neuroimaging methods is linking the\nunderpinning of human thinking \u2013 across individual and societal levels. On\nthe applied side, masses of data on human behavior are now being collected\nto describe and predict activity in a huge variety of applications spanning\neveryday consumer devices, socio-commercial networks, and population\nmonitoring systems installed by local and national governments, to name a\nfew. Online populations can now support crowd-sourced and A/B experiments\nthat drive how corporations interact with their customers and governments\nwith their citizens.\nA reexamination of the issues addressed by the earlier studies is clearly\ncalled for, in light of what\u2019s happened over the last decade. This volume does\njust that and is a particularly welcome addition to the research community. It\nis structured to address issues of science, modeling, and relationships among\ntheory, modeling, empirical research, and computational social science. It\ncandidly emphasizes past shortcomings in these relationships and current\nprogress that\u2019s been made in improving those relationships. One can sense a\ngood deal of excitement among the contributors \u2013 both established researchers\nin their chosen fields and fresh PhDs \u2013 because so much is happening on so\nmany fronts, including theory development, data collection, and computa-\ntional methods of inquiry. It\u2019s also a delight to see chapters bringing to bear\nnew insights from the study of nonhuman social systems, neuropsychology,\npsychology, and anthropology, among other disciplines. And, having spent\nmuch of my career concerned about real-world problems needing insightsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Social-behavioral modeling will continue to be beset by uncertainties\nbecause the social-behavioral phenomena occur in complex adaptive systems\ninto which we have imperfect and sometimes contradictory insight. Nonethe-\nless, such modeling \u2013 if undertaken appropriately \u2013 can help humans who\nmust plan, operate, and adapt in their complex worlds. One of the editors\u2019\nthemes is most welcome: complexity need not be paralyzing, especially if\nwe take a multidisciplinary use-centric approach to working on real-world\nproblems.\nAll in all, this volume is a welcome contribution that will be valuable to diverse\naudiences in schoolhouses, research laboratories, and the workplace. It is a col-\nlection, not a textbook or single-author monograph, and it conveys an excellent\nsense of the current state of the art and the exciting opportunities that are now\nbeing exploited. The editors deserve credit for bringing about, organizing, and\npersonally contributing heavily to this volume that merits a prominent place\nin the libraries of human behavior researchers, as well as those interested in\nhelping solve some of the larger socio-technical issues facing us. I heartily rec-\nommend this volume to all of you.\n22 July 2018 Greg L. Zacharias\nWeston, Massachusetts\nReferences\nNational Research Council (1998).

Davis 2 , and Angela O\u2019Mahony 2\n1 Information Innovation Office (I20), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Arlington,\nVA 22203-2114, USA\n2 RAND Corporation and Pardee RAND Graduate School, Santa Monica, CA 90407-2138, USA\nTechnology is transforming the human condition at an ever-increasing pace.\nNew technologies emerge and dramatically change our daily lives in months\nrather than years. Yet, key aspects of the human condition \u2013 our consciousness,\npersonalities and emotions, beliefs and attitudes, perceptions, decisions and\nbehaviors, and social relationships \u2013 have long resisted description in terms of\nscientific, falsifiable laws like those found in the natural sciences. Past advances\nin our knowledge of the human condition have had valuable impacts,1 but much\nmore is possible. New technologies are providing extraordinary opportunity for\ngaining deeper understanding and, significantly, for using that understanding\nto help realize the immense positive potential of the humankind.\nIn the information age our understanding of the human condition is\ndeepening with new ways to observe, experiment, and understand behavior.\nThese range from, say, identifying financial and spatiotemporal data that\ncorrelate with individual well-being to drawing on the narratives of social\nmedia and other communications to infer population-wide beliefs, norms,\nand biases. An unprecedented volume of data is available, an astonishing\nproportion of which describes human activity and can help us explore\nthe factors that drive behavior. Statistical correlations from such data are\n1 Examples include epidemiological modeling and an understanding of collective behavior that\nhas helped make it possible to blunt, contain, and then defeat epidemic outbreaks; the\ndestigmatizing of mental health problems; the use of game theory in developing nuclear\ndeterrence theory; and applications of nudge theory in behavioral economics, as in instituting\nopt-in-as-a-default policies resulting in more workers availing themselves of economic benefits in\npension plans.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

New\nexperimentation platforms have the potential to support both theory-\ninformed and data-driven analysis to discover and test the mechanisms that\nunderlie human behavior. For example, millions of users of a social website\nor millions of players of online games can be exposed to different carefully\ncontrolled situations \u2013 within seconds \u2013 across regional and cultural bound-\naries. Such technologies enable heretofore impossible forms and scales of\nexperimentation. At the same time, these new capabilities raise important\nissues of how to perform such experimentation, how to correctly interpret the\nresults, and, critically, how to ensure the highest ethical standards.\nSuch advances mean that theory development and testing in the\nsocial-behavioral sciences are poised for revolutionary changes. Behavioral\ntheories, whether based on observation, in situ experiments, or laboratory\nexperiments can now be revisited with new technology-enabled instruments.\nApplying these new instruments requires confronting issues of reproducibility,\ngeneralizability, and falsifiability. Doing so will help catalyze new standards for\nscientific meaning in the social-behavioral sciences. The massive scale of some\nsuch studies will require complex experimental designs, but these could also\nenable substantially automated methods that can address many problems of\nreproducibility and generalizability.\nSimilarly, representation of knowledge about the human condition is poised\nfor revolution. Using mathematics and computation to formally describe\nhuman behavior is not new (Luce et al. 1963), but new and large-scale data\ncollection methods require us to reconsider how to best represent, verify, and\nvalidate knowledge in the social and behavioral sciences. New approaches are\nneeded to capture the complex, multiresolution, and multifaceted nature of\nthe human condition as studied with different observational and experimental\ninstruments. Capturing this knowledge will require new thinking about\nmathematical and computational formalisms and methods, as well as attention\nto such engineering hurdles as achieving computational tractability.\nAdvances in knowledge representation will also motivate advances in social\nand behavioral science. The need for accuracy and precision in describing\nthe current understanding of the human condition will require models with\nstructured descriptions of data sources, data interpretations, and related\nassumptions. These will support calibration, testing, and integration and,\ncritically, identifying gaps in current theory and instruments. Mathematical,\ncomputational, and structured qualitative can models provide a compre-\nhensive epistemology for the social and behavioral sciences \u2013 describing\nnot only what is known but also the certainty and generalizability of that\nknowledge. This will allow comparing different and even conflicting sources of\nknowledge and resulting theories, as well as identifying future research needs.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, access to an\never-expanding body of knowledge about the human condition must be\nappropriately managed, especially as techniques for reflecting and combining\nthe inherent uncertainties in the growing knowledge base are developed. Also,\nwe must understand how to use these increasingly accurate models and how\nto quantify and share information transparently, including information about\nuncertainty, so as actually to assist human decisionmaking rather than increase\nconfusion. Accurately representing the growing bounds of our knowledge\nabout the human condition is essential for ensuring ethical application of the\nknowledge and maximizing its benefit for society (Muller 2018).\nChallenges\nWe are at the beginning of an era in which sound computational models of\nhuman behavior and its causes can be constructed. Such models have vast\npotential to positively affect the human condition. Yet, despite this heady\npromise, a great deal of creativity and innovation will be needed to surmount\nthe considerable challenges. Even describing these challenges remains a\nsubject for scholarly debate; therefore, the list of challenges below should be\nconsidered representative rather than comprehensive (see also Chapter 2,\nDavis and O\u2019Mahony 2018).\nChallenge One: The Complexity of Human Issues\nFirst and foremost, it is for good reasons that the social and behavioral\nsciences have not progressed in the same way as the natural sciences. The\nhuman condition is inherently complex with overlapping multiresolution\nfeatures across multiple dimensions (e.g. from short to long time frames,\nfrom individual behavior to group activities and governance, and from indi-\nvidual neuronal physiology to brain-region activation, psychophysical action,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n6 A Vision of the Future for Social-Behavioral Modeling\ncognitive task performance, and intelligence and consciousness). Further,\nthe factors driving behavior change at different rates as a function of the\nphysical world, technology, and social interactions, resulting in emergent,\npopulation-wide change. Such complexities contribute to what have been\ncalled wicked problems (Churchman 1967; Rittel and Noble 1989). Recognizing\nthe implications of these complexities in studying the human condition is a\ncritical first step.\nChallenge Two: Fragmentation\nThe social and behavioral sciences are fragmented within and across such\nconstituent disciplines as psychology, sociology, political science, and eco-\nnomics. Each discipline has made many contributions to our knowledge and\nmethods, but few attempts have been made to integrate that knowledge.\nFragmentation occurs as the result of (i) studying separately different aspects\nof the human condition (e.g. trust in information, mental health, community\nformation), (ii) studying at different levels of detail (e.g. psychomotor systems,\nindividual cognition, economic systems, political systems), (iii) using diverse\nmethods (e.g. qualitative observation, structured interviewing, surveys,\ncontrolled laboratory experiments, in situ experiments, analysis of existing\ndata sets, natural experiments, computational simulation), and (iv) applying\ndiffering concepts of and standards for meaningful scientific rigor as evidenced\nby variations of acceptance criteria across peer-reviewed publications (e.g.\nacceptance criteria for studies on just-noticeable differences in psychomotor\nresponses necessarily differ from those for studies on delayed gratification in\ninfants). Some prominent researchers have argued for standards within their\ndisciplines (King et al. 1994) but different standards are clearly needed for\ndifferent conceptual and empirical approaches (Brady and Collier 2010).\nA fifth important manifestation of fragmentation is the awkward and overly\nnarrow relationship between theoretical and empirical inquiry (Davis et al.\n2018) (see also Chapter 2). In the domain of social-behavioral work, the\ntheory and models are overly narrow \u2013 focusing on some particular variables\nand ignoring others. They are also not adequately related to empirical data,\nin part because such data has been hard to come by. Most data analysis is\ninsufficiently informed by suitable theory: empirical comparisons are often\nmade to particular very narrow theories, but not to theories that put the\npieces together. Relationships among theory, empirical, and computational\nwork are not yet well drawn. Let us comment briefly on some of these\nmatters.\nEmpirical Observation\nObservational approaches view behavior in naturalistic and uncontrolled\nsettings (i.e. with no managed interventions). They include traditionalDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nChallenges 7\ntrained-observer approaches (e.g. manual coding of behaviors according to\nsome schema, ethnographic observation) as well as newer approaches applying\nstatistical and other methods to the masses of data on human activity now\navailable. These approaches identify factors meriting additional experimental\nstudy and confounding factors to be managed in such experiments. One\ncomplicating issue is that analytic results can vary significantly not just across\ndisciplines but also from study to study as uncontrolled factors influence\nresults. Technology continues to change the realm of the possible in such\nwork, but the few attempts to create standard practices have quickly fallen\nbehind the state of the technologically possible.\nAnother issue is that observational data are necessarily interpreted by the\nresearcher. That is, the meaning of the observed behavior is inferred, often\nwithout standards on how such meaning is derived (e.g. the notion of economic\nhealth could be based on the price of electricity, the number of transactions at\nrestaurants, or stock market fluctuations). Another issue is that the opportunity\nto study a phenomenon may be transient and impossible to re-create because\nof the real-world circumstances that led to the phenomenon or because of lim-\nitations in access to reliable data (e.g. regulatory limits on access to financial\ndata). We must recognize, then, that the ability to derive and substantiate causal\nfactors from observation alone is likely to be highly limited, although more\nrecent work on finding natural experiments (also called quasi-experiments) is\nsometimes quite valuable. Observational approaches rely on the space of what\nhas happened or is happening and do not permit creating new situations. Ana-\nlytic results from such approaches are ripe for misinterpretation by nonexperts\n(and, sometimes, experts) who generalize outcomes without understanding the\nlimits of the observations and the quality of inferences made from those obser-\nvations. Unfortunately, the social and behavioral sciences also lack consistent\nstandards for quantifying the certainty around such analytic results (e.g. while\ndata scientists may report standard deviations, they may fail to report the span\nof the underlying data and/or noise-correction methods used).\nEmpirical Experiments\nExperimental approaches hold conditions constant except for those variables\nthat are systematically varied (sometimes referred to as managing an inter-\nvention). Such experimentation is a pillar of traditional science. Experimental\napproaches lie along a spectrum of controlled to semi-controlled \u2013 that is, the\ndegree to which potentially confounding factors can be controlled, independent\nvariables manipulated, and dependent variables measured. For example, a typ-\nical laboratory experiment will differ in these dimensions from a randomized\ncontrolled trial conducted in situ. Experiments necessarily introduce some arti-\nficiality (e.g. participants in a study may change their behaviors simply because\nthey are aware of being in a study). Managing this artificiality is difficult and\nrelies on the researcher\u2019s expertise and his or her discipline\u2019s accepted practices.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n8 A Vision of the Future for Social-Behavioral Modeling\nArtificiality in terms of the participant population is a related problem.\nThe social and behavioral science community has recognized, for example, a\nbroad bias toward Western, educated populations from industrialized, rich,\ndeveloped countries (Henrich et al. 2010). A further difficulty in experimental\napproaches is that even a carefully designed experiment may fail to accommo-\ndate some unknown confounding variable. Worse, should such a confounding\nfactor be found after the original experiment was conducted, it is unlikely that\nthat additional data on that factor was collected in the original experiment,\nmeaning that the overall validity of that experiment may be dramatically\nreduced. The discovery of new variables therefore has the ability to undermine\nthe value of past empirical work. This leads to the problem of reproducibility,\nsuch as the degree to which empirical studies adequately document all aspects\nof an experiment so that they may be independently tested and potentially\nunknown confounding factors can be exposed. These problems have been\nwell documented in a number of recent studies (Nosek and Open Science\nForum 2015). As with observational approaches, experimental data is also\nsubject to a degree of interpretation, although standards for statistical analysis\nare generally clear and accepted. Regardless, the potential for unknown\nconfounds means that while statistical confidence intervals describe one form\nof uncertainty, other forms are difficult to quantify.\nGenerative Simulation\nAs discussed above and in Chapter 2, we see computational social science as\none of the three pillars of modern science (along with theory and empiricism).\nOne crucial aspect of computational social science is its generative ability.\nGenerative simulation supports study of (i) heretofore unencountered and/or\nhard-to-anticipate situations, (ii) situations that are hard to study or measure\nbecause of access restrictions, and (iii) situations for which real-world exper-\niments could be considered overly artificial (e.g. a population\u2019s response to a\ndeadly pandemic or disaster) (Waldrop 2018). Significantly, the data from such\ngenerative models can be studied by both observation and experimentation.\nThat is, the output of simulated data can be observed in an uncontrolled way\nor after systematic changes to some variables.\nSuch simulations range in complexity. The most complex simulations\ngenerate masses of data and require advanced analytic capabilities to explain\nthe emergent behavior of the simulated system. Simpler simulations (e.g.\nsome game theory-based simulations) also have the potential to inform\nunderstanding of individual and social behavior. In both simple and complex\nsimulations, describing the propagation of uncertainty remains a significant\nissue. These approaches (even if rough) supplement empirical observational\nand experimental methods.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nChallenges 9\nUnification\nA major challenge, then, is how to unify across theoretical, observational,\nexperimental and generative approaches (and variant sub approaches within\neach). Any such unification requires understanding the qualities of each\napproach. This is akin to challenges in the natural sciences where conclusions\ndraw on theory (and sometimes competing theories), experimental data\nobtained with different instruments and methods, and computations based on\nthe best physical models available. Although no single set of standards is in\nthe offing for such unification, there is need for a common understanding of\nsound ways to unify knowledge.\nChallenge Three: Representations\nCreating mathematical or computational representations of complex human\nbehavior is itself a challenge. While applied mathematicians and computer\nscientists offer many representational formalisms (e.g. differential equations,\nhidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, theorem approaches, system\ndynamics), deciding which to use in describing a particular social-behavioral\nphenomenon requires careful consideration. For example, when and where do\nbehavior processes follow different probability distributions? A core issue is\ncoping with the multiple types of uncertainty across different data sources and\nthe under-specification of social-behavioral theories. That is, not only is the\nselection of particular computational or mathematical formalisms deserving of\nscrutiny but also their ability to represent the phenomena of interest and, crit-\nically, the many associated uncertainties and assumptions. For example, what\ncomputational representations can best integrate laboratory \u2013 experiment\ndata on a specific population with the statistical analysis of correlations across\npopulations? Selecting and integrating multiple formalisms, to include dealing\nwith the propagation of uncertainty, and developing mappings across them,\nwill be an active area for future research.\nChallenge Four: Applications of Social-Behavioral Modeling\nThe final and most consequential challenge is translating knowledge of the\nhuman condition into the decisions and actions of individual citizens, of\ncorporate or government leadership, or, increasingly, automated systems.\nCommunicating current knowledge of the human condition and its uncer-\ntainties is critical. Society does some of this today, as when engineers use\nknowledge of human behavior to design roads and place warning signs\nappropriately. However, modern social-behavioral knowledge is also being\napplied in domains that raise profound ethical and moral considerationsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

At the root of such concerns is yet\nanother type of problem \u2013 the need to ask how the consumer of knowledge\nabout human behavior can realistically use that knowledge. Fortunately, some\naspects of this challenge are already active areas of research, such as work\non communicating uncertainty, on creating explanations of complex analytic\nmethods (e.g. explaining machine learning techniques), and on how to help\ndecision-makers to assess the trustworthiness of data and analyses of data.\nSo also, research is underway on how to allow humans to better understand\nprivacy issues and how to protect themselves (see Chapter 3, Balebako et al.\n2018). In any case, given that improved and accessible understanding of the\nhuman condition can be used for both good and bad purposes, more research\nis needed to understand the issues and develop protections.\nAbout This Book\nInterest in social-behavioral modeling for complex systems has waxed and\nwaned, but is now very much ascending. This book came about because we\nrecognized that a large community was very interested and deeply involved, as\nillustrated by a large number of studies and conferences, many of them related\nto data and data analytics and others being broader in scope.2 Identifying and\narticulating common questions, challenges, and opportunities across all of\nthese activities has become a priority.\nWith that in mind, we began the book project and solicited chapters from\nprominent and diverse researchers to represent a broad perspective on recent\ndevelopments and the future of research on modeling of the human condition.\nTheir chapters offer a great deal of wisdom and numerous suggestions based\non their experience and visions. Many of the chapters posit pathways for future\nwork in specific areas, each of which could revolutionize our understanding of\nthe human condition. Although even this sizable volume is addressing only a\nsampling of the myriad efforts underway, it draws on work in at least the follow-\ning areas: anthropology, cognitive psychology, complex adaptive systems, com-\nputer science, data science, economics, electrical engineering, health research,\nlaw, medicine, modeling and simulation, neuroscience, physics, policy analy-\nsis, political science, social psychology, and sociology. Interestingly, many of the\n2 A few of many examples include the ongoing \u201cDecadal Survey of the Social and Behavioral\nSciences and Applications to National Security\u201d by the National Academy of Sciences,\nDARPA-sponsored RAND workshops on privacy and ethics (Balebako et al. 2017), and priority\nchallenges for social and behavioral modeling (Davis et al. 2018) and various professional\nconferences by, e.g. the Society for Computational Social Sciences and Social Computing,\nBehavioral-Cultural Modeling & Prediction and Behavior Representation in Modeling\n(SBP-BRIMS). Chapter 2 of this volume also cites numerous foundational documents from earlier\nwork, including an important National Academy study from a decade ago (Zacharias et al. 2008).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Many are also concerned with\napplication to real-world problems.\nWith all humility, then, we hope the book will be an inspirational crosscutting\nmilestone volume that helps set the agenda for the next decade of research and\ndevelopment. We hope that it will prove stimulating to a number of audiences:\n(i) scientists and modelers; (ii) organizations that support basic and applied\nresearch; (iii) practitioners who apply social-behavioral science and computa-\ntional modeling; and (iv) decision-makers responsible for addressing individual\nand societal-level problems. All of the chapters reflect the ultimate goal of this\nbook: to reflect on the opportunities for technology to help transform the social\nand behavioral sciences while \u2013 at the same time \u2013 honoring our duty to create\nscientifically sound knowledge and assure that it is responsibly used to bene-\nfit mankind. We (the editors) see researchers as having heavy and nontrivial\nresponsibilities for creating models with a solid basis in reality and for ensur-\ning that the models and related analytic tools are used responsibly to benefit\nhumanity.\nRoadmap for the Book\nThe book is divided into distinct parts (see Table 1.1). Part I sets the stage.\nChapter 2 is an overview of social-behavioral modeling for complex systems.\nIt structures the subject area in terms of three pillars: theory, empirical\nobservation and experimentation, and computational observation and\nexperimentation. These exist in an ecology that includes infrastructure,\ngovernance, and technology. Chapter 2 also establishes goals of usefulness\nof social-behavioral modeling and identifies priorities. Chapter 3 recognizes\nthe fundamental importance of seeing opportunities and challenges in a\nframework that recognizes ethical and privacy issues from the very start.\nSince modeling is an attempt to represent and exploit knowledge, it needs\nfoundations in science. Part II, Social-Behavioral Science Foundations, is a\nset of nine chapters about frontier aspects of social-behavioral science and\nits implications for modeling. Part III is a set of nine chapters discussing\nhow social-behavioral modeling can and should be informed by underlying\ntheory and modern ubiquitous data, not only traditional data from social\nscience research, but new forms reflecting social media, recreational games,\nand laboratory experiments. One of the themes is the need to better relate\ntheory and data: theory should be informed by data, and both data collection\nand data analysis should be informed by theory; but neither should be unduly\nconstrained by the other, and competition of inquiry should be encouraged.\nPart IV is about modeling itself, describing innovations and challenges in doing\nso.

It should inform policy-making on such\nsecurity and social-policy issues as radicalization for terrorism, weakening of\ndemocracy by foreign influence campaigns, improving prospects for stability\nafter international interventions, managing population behaviors after natural\ndisasters, and dealing with the opioid crisis and epidemics. Today\u2019s SBM is\ncontributing far less to the study of such matters than it could. Major advances\nare needed, but in what? We offer suggestions distilled from a longer study\n(Davis et al. 2018).\nBefore proceeding, it may be useful to give two examples of what may in the\nfuture be possible.\nVignette 1\nToday (March 1, 2035), the US government released its report on home-\ngrown terrorism with good news: the number of youths seeking to join\nviolent extremist groups such as the descendants of ISIS and Al-Qaeda\nhas dropped precipitously.

Early in the 2020s, the simulation laboratory tested alternative portfolios\nof intervention activities to find a package that would be likely to succeed with\nlow risks of such bad side effects as acrimonious community rejection. Many\nideas thought initially to be promising were discarded because the simulations\ncredibly suggested a significant probability of counterproductive effects. As\nthe simulations anticipated, successful implementation has also required rapid\nadaptation as social science is improved, social patterns and communications\nchange, external events occur, and data indicates what works and does not.\nOverall, models have been less about predicting the future than about helping\nto chart a roughly right course and prepare for adaptations (sometimes in\nminutes or days, rather than months).\nVignette 2\nIt is 2035. Students in the nation\u2019s best business-administration program now\ntake a labor-management negotiations course using a simulation laboratory in\nwhich computer agents represent labor and management actors at top, middle,\nand individual levels and also community governments with authority for con-\nsidering incentives and constraints. Sometimes, human teams play these roles,\ninterchangeably with agents. Students often have a background in business eco-\nnomics and game theory, in which case they imagine initially that negotiations\nwill be just a matter of finding a mutually agreeable optimum agreement. They\ndiscover, however, that the opposing teams are distrustful because of opposed\nviews and a long history of troubled relationships. Further, they seem erratic\nin their demands (due, in some cases, to factional internal disputes, as when\nworkers and their labor negotiators go back and forth, or when a corporation\u2019s\nboard and the company managers disagree among themselves about objectives\nand responsibility to the community). Neither side understands the other well\nand, at the outset, neither respects the others\u2019 values. Exogenous events also\noccur, as when recessions strike, the president announces a new trade policy, or\nthe Federal Reserve changes interest rates. Negotiations stop and start, some-\ntimes because of temper tantrums or events or sometimes because of seemingly\nimpossible impasses. Sometimes, a given simulation leads to bargains emerg-\ning; sometimes, it does not. Students learn about how to build on success and\nhow to change losing games. They learn how to adapt their own value struc-\ntures or how to understand the values of others. They practice the art of finding\npossible acceptable outcomes and then working backward to infer necessary\nor helpful ingredients in their approach.

We discuss the challenges to SBM in two groups: inherent\nchallenges and challenges relating to specific issues that are difficult to address\nwith current mainstream practices.\nInherent Challenges\nFour inherent challenges relate to individual cognition, social systems as\ncomplex adaptive systems (CAS), the dynamic and storytelling character of\npeople, and dealing with wicked problems. All are especially relevant to the\nfuture of SBM.\nIndividual Cognition and Behavior\nSocial science in the mid- to late twentieth century leaned heavily on the\neconomist\u2019s notion of a rational actor. Although very useful, it has fatal flaws.\nHerbert Simon\u2019s Nobel Prize celebrated his discussion of human bounded\nrationality, the fact that human decision-making is limited by finite and\nimperfect information, cognitive limitations, and time. As a result, humans\nemploy shortcuts to find strategies that are good enough for the purposes\nat hand (i.e. that satisfice) (Simon 1978). Simon discussed the matter as\nfollows:\n\u2026 the first consequence of the principle of bounded rationality is that\nthe intended rationality of an actor requires him to construct a simplified\nmodel of the real situation in order to deal with it. He behaves rationally\nwith respect to this model, and such behavior is not even approximately\noptimal with respect to the real world. To predict his behavior we must\nunderstand the way in which this simplified model is constructed, and\nits construction will certainly be related to his psychological properties\nas a perceiving, thinking, and learning animal.\n(Simon 1957, p. 198)Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n18 Improving Social-Behavioral Modeling\nThe items to which Simon alluded in the last sentence have been exhaustively\nstudied by psychologists for a half century. Early work revealed systematic\ncognitive biases in human reasoning, relative to that of the idealized economic\nactor (Kahneman and Tversky 1982). Subsequent research noted that \u2013 despite\nthese biases \u2013 so-called naturalistic or intuitive human behavior also has\ngreat virtues (Klein 1998; Gigerenzer and Selten 2002). Kahneman discusses\nthe virtues and shortcomings of cognitive biases, and of intuitive thinking,\ndistinguishing between what he calls fast and slow thinking, modes for both of\nwhich are built in biologically and have survival advantages (Kahneman 2011).\nThe emerging holistic view is an example of science at its best, a remarkable\nsynthesis.\nThis departure of human cognition and behavior from that of the idealized\nrational actor has profound implications, as illustrated by the rise of behavioral\neconomics (Thaler 1994; Sunstein 2014), versions of deterrence theory that rec-\nognize the role of perceptions and biases (Jervis et al. 1985; National Research\nCouncil 2014), modeling of adversaries (Davis 2018), and many other contexts\nwhere cultural factors are important (Faucher 2018). Agent-based modeling\n(ABM) represents such matters, but, so far, it has typically not incorporated\nsuch matters well (see, however, Read and Miller 2019; Sukthankar and Behesti\n2019). As discussed recently by Robert Axtell, a pioneer in ABM, numerous\nassumptions need to be abandoned if ABM is to reach its potential (Axtell et al.\n2016; O\u2019Mahony and Davis 2019). Interestingly, a different tack will be to rep-\nresent behavior as emanating more from primal considerations than reasoning,\nas suggested by behavior of nonhuman species (Pavlic 2019).\nSocial Systems as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)\nIf an individual\u2019s reasoning is complicated, that of humans as a whole is even\nmore so because humans are social: their values, beliefs, and behaviors depend\non interactions and learning. Indeed, social systems are CAS, the behavior of\nwhich is famously troublesome with even small changes in initial conditions or\nevents over time sometimes having outsized effects on the system\u2019s dynamics\n(Holland and Mimnaugh 1996; Page 2010).\nThis said, it is not hopeless to study CAS with an eye toward predictions and\na degree of influence. A CAS is uncontrollable in only certain of its states. Key\nissues are recognizing which states of the system are subject to a degree of influ-\nence and \u2013 for those that are \u2013 what can be achieved and with what risks. For\nCAS that are not in controllable states, it is sometimes possible to identify the\nalternative states that may emerge. Confronting the CAS challenge has many\nimplications for SBM, but these include the need to do better in representing\nvariable-structure systems and emergent phenomena.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nInherent Challenges 19\nThe Dynamic and Storytelling Character of People and Social Systems\nA related matter is that people and societies depend on storytelling or narra-\ntives to make ostensible sense of the world (Corman 2012; Corman et al. 2019;\nCowherd and Lende 2019; Paul 2019). The narratives can change markedly and\nsometimes unpredictably. Narratives are not simple objects, attributes, or pro-\ncesses (the building blocks of usual computational models). How should they\nbe represented in modeling? Will prospective models be able to generate these\nfeatures, i.e. to have them be emergent rather than baked in? A number of\nmechanisms for doing so may exist. One is defining alternative agents with dif-\nferent characters that embody the different narratives. These might coexist (as\nwhen humans act as if they have conflicting personas) or might be activated or\ninactivated in the course of events. Some early experiments along these lines\noccurred with Cold War modeling of Red and Blue agents in automated war\ngaming (Davis 2018). Future approaches will need to allow for narratives to\nemerge that have not previously been anticipated.\nWicked Problems\nA fourth inherent challenge has a different character, although aspects relate\nto the CAS phenomena of social systems and the emergence of narratives.\nThe success of SBM will depend on its value in aiding human decisions. Much\nformal education and modeling focuses on finding optimum solutions to\nwell-defined problems. Policy-makers, however, are often confronted with\nso-called wicked problems that, by definition, have no preordained solution\nor even a priori objectives to be achieved (Rosenhead and Mingers 2002).\nSuch problems are central to much policy analysis and strategic planning. In\nfavorable cases of wicked problems, people come in the course of interacting\nto agree on some actions and perhaps some objectives. If so, these agreements\nemerge rather than being predetermined or implied. The socialization process\nis crucial because it creates new or adjusted perceptions and values. To put\nthe matter differently, the notion that individuals have fixed utility functions is\noften quite wrong. Through interactions and other experiences, people learn,\nchange values, and sometimes find ways to compromise. Doing so is crucial\nfor humans going beyond the solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short lives that\nThomas Hobbes discussed in the seventeenth century.\nHow can SBM help with wicked problems? One imperative is confronting\nthe realities of CAS, as mentioned above. We also believe that it will be\nnecessary for SBM to move away from the common ideal of closed simulation\nto embrace man\u2013machine interaction, human gaming, and man\u2013machine\nlaboratories where people can gain experiential knowledge (Rouse 2015, 2019)Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We then discuss the\nneed for a rebalancing of the portfolio of methods and models used in social\nscience and its modeling, confronting uncertainty, relating theory to experi-\nmental information, finding synthesis opportunities, and rethinking the con-\ncept of model validity.\nBackground on Fragmentation of SB Theories\nToday\u2019s SB theories exist in bewilderingly large numbers 1 but are typically\nnarrow and fragmented and often conflicting. Part of obtaining an advanced\ndegree in social science is learning to navigate through the corresponding\nthickets. Professors strive to help such navigation, but the current situation is\nnonetheless troubled.\nThe Nature of Theory\nOne manifestation of the fragmentation is in the view of theory. In contrast to\nthe treatment of theory in physical sciences, in which theory unifies, broadens,\nand explains, social science theories tend to be simple conceptual models that\nwork in only very limited contexts rather than more generally (i.e. context dom-\ninates). Social scientists tend to be empirically driven and are comfortable with\na diversity of theories. As a contrast, imagine that physicists still talked sep-\narately about Boyle\u2019s and Charles\u2019 gas laws, perihelion theory, Bohr\u2019s theory,\nwave theory, friction theory, and so on (an observation motivated by a recent\n1 For example, browsing the Web for social psychology theories yields an illustrative list with\nattribution theory, cognitive dissonance theory, drive theory, elaboration likelihood model,\nmotivation crowding theory, observational learning theory, positioning theory, schemata theory,\nself-perception theory, self-verification theory, social comparison theory, social exchange theory,\nsocial penetration theory, socioemotional selectivity theory, terror management theory, and\ntriangular theory of love.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Physics, however, has been studied\nfor millennia, and many of its fragments have been integrated.\nIn physics, perhaps because of the field\u2019s relative maturity, theory connotes\nsomething offering generality, coherence, and explanatory power \u2013 e.g. classical\nmechanics (Newton), classical electromagnetics (Maxwell), quantum mechan-\nics (Schr\u00f6dinger, Heisenberg, Dirac), and relativity (Einstein). Although mys-\nteries persist, much is understood about how these theories relate to each other.\nThese exemplify the understanding of scientific theory expressed by the US\nNational Academy (National Academy of Sciences 1999, p. 2):\n\u2026 theories are the end points of science. They are understandings\nthat develop from extensive observation, experimentation, and creative\nreflection. They incorporate a large body of scientific facts, laws, tested\nhypotheses, and logical inferences.\nThe authors might better have said that theories are at least for now end\npoints, since even good theories are sometimes extended, corrected, or other-\nwise enriched over time. The National Academy\u2019s point, however, was correct.\nSimilarities and Differences\nIn reviewing the claimed differences between the social and physical sciences,\nwe have benefited from the more recent philosophy of science literature\n(Cartwright 1999; Haack 2011), which has come far since the discussions of\nPopper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Feyerabend that we studied earlier in our profes-\nsional careers. We conclude that the inherent differences between the physical\nand social sciences should not be exaggerated. Although the social sciences\nare dominated by different methods than the physical sciences, the primary\ndifferences probably lie in the nature of explanations and evidence. Social\nscience \u201ctries to understand people\u2019s behavior by coming up with explanatory\nhypotheses about their beliefs, goals, etc.\u201d (Haack 2011, p. 166). And, although\nfragmented in many respects, it is possible \u2013 from a remove \u2013 to provide consid-\nerable unity in the concepts that dominate social science (Nyblade et al. 2019).\nWe also pondered the ubiquitous claim that context matters more in social\nscience than in the physical sciences. We argue that that is misleading. The\nmaturity of the physical sciences consists in significant degree in their having\nidentified and defined the factors that constitute context. Physical theories spe-\ncialize for varied contexts (e.g. dilute gases vs. dense gases; fluids at ordinary\ntemperatures vs. temperatures where superfluidity appears). Indeed, the notion\nthat well-known physical theories are general is misleading because, in fact,\nthey pertain to idealized worlds. Their value in the real world depends on sub-\nstantial modifications accounting for real circumstances (Cartwright 1983).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n22 Improving Social-Behavioral Modeling\nEmergence is often mentioned as something unique to social CAS.2 It is\nworth noting, however, that physics and chemistry have analogues to CAS\nbehavior, albeit without sentient agents. Think of phase transitions, such\nas precipitation from liquids or the transition of a solid to a condition of\nsuperconductivity. Or think of self-organization in nonequilibrium systems,\nwhich was studied by theoretical chemists at much the same that CAS theory\nbegan to be appreciated, sometimes using similar mathematics (Nicolis and\nPrigogine 1977).\nDespite these cautions about exaggerating inherent differences, differences\ncertainly exist today in practice between the physical and social sciences.\nTable 2.1 shows some comparisons, drawn starkly for the sake of exposition.\nSocial science modeling tends to be empirically driven with statistical methods\nfor finding correlations that fit data with as few variables as possible. To\nsocial scientists, to say that a model explains the data usually means only that\na regression formula fits the data with acceptably small residuals. Physical\nscience models (especially system models) tend to be concepts driven, to\nemphasize causal relationships, to include more variables, and to regard a\nmodel as explanatory only if it provides a satisfying and coherent description\nof cause\u2013effect relationships. The aspirations of social science theories are\nrelatively modest, the number of theories is large, and the number of inconsis-\ntencies across theories is large as well. Although they are sometimes important\nin informing policy choices (e.g. when health trials suggest that certain types\nof exercise may prolong health into old age), correlational theories have known\nshortcomings (Pearl and Mackenzie 2018). Good system theories are better\nbecause causation is more explicit.\nReality is more complicated than Table 2.1 would have it. Great advances\nhave occurred in social science. For example, while quantitative statistical\nanalysis was once regarded by many scholars as more scientific than qualitative\nresearch even when merely correlational, today\u2019s graduate students learn about\nthe strengths and weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative approaches.\nThe latter is often insightful about causality. Further, econometricians now\nemphasize causal relationships and have developed quasi-experimental\nmethods to infer them from natural experiments (Angrist and Pischke 2009).\nSome qualitative research is now well structured and highly regarded, as with\ncomparative case studies (George and Bennett 2005). Hybrid approaches\nthat use both case studies and quantitative analysis well are especially useful\n(Sambanis 2004).\nNonetheless, on balance, most social science products are a poor match for\nthe needs of those seeking to advance SB science and apply it problems using SB\n2 Interestingly, disagreements exist on the definition of emergence and beliefs about to what\nextent simulation can generate emerge, as discussed in a panel chapter in this volume (O\u2019Mahony\nand Davis 2019).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The modeling community is not receiving what it needs from\nthe science community (McNamara et al. 2011). At the same time, many in the\nmodeling community do not try very hard to get into the scientific subtleties\nbecause of being more passionate about the programming than the science\nand because it is so difficult to translate empirically driven and statistically\ninterpreted social science into causal system models. A sore point with social\nscientists is that computerized SBM often claim to be based on a named social\nscience theory, but actually represent the body of work with nothing more than\nsome name-dropping and a parameter.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Causal models are crucial for addressing many issues. As\nJudea Pearl has emphasized,\nwe can\u2019t really deal with issues such as influence, effect, confounding,\nholding constant, intervention, and explanation without causal models.\n(Pearl 2009)\nThe issues that he identifies are crucial in policy-making (Pearl and Mackenzie\n2018).\nThe requirement for multivariate and systemic modeling reflects the fact that\nmany important SB phenomena are due to the interaction of numerous fac-\ntors. Further, system models are often nonlinear. The ubiquity of nonlinearity\nis illustrated by physical systems such as aircraft with a number of critical com-\nponents (each component must work or the system fails), the product form\nof Cobb\u2013Douglas production functions in economics, the nonlinear nature\nof many system dynamics models in diverse business or public-policy areas\n(Sterman 2000), or the nonlinear qualitative theory needed to understand the\nrise of and public support for terrorism (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2017). We have\nalready discussed the need for more models that are unifying, coherent, and\nrelatively more general than the existing set of fragmented models.\nAs noted earlier, the corresponding modeling should also allow for the very\nstructure of systems to change with new entities coming into existence and oth-\ners disappearing and with their value structures changing as well. Overall, we\nneed richer system models in which all of these phenomena can emerge natu-\nrally, as occurs with CAS. Achieving such models and learning how to use them\nanalytically is a profound multifaceted challenge.\nWhat We Are Not Saying. None of this means that we doubt the value of\nmuch existing social science theory for traditional purposes or that we harbor\nnotions of some grand overall theory of everything. Such a theory does not yet\nexist even in the more aged field of physics, and it is implausible in the human\ndomain (Cartwright 1999; Konner 2003). We do see the need, however, to move\nin the direction of more unified and general theories.\nConfronting Uncertainty\nAnother fundamental challenge for SBM is routinely building into models the\ncapability to deal with uncertainty. Doing so is crucial for CAS for which reliableDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It is difficult, however, especially when dealing with deep\nuncertainty, i.e. the uncertainty that obtains when we do not know (or agree\non) how actions relate to consequences, probability distributions for inputs to\nthe models, which consequences to consider, or their relative importance.3 For-\ntunately, much progress has been made on dealing with uncertainty in other\nfields, and the methods can be brought over into SB work (Davis 2019).\nCombination, Synthesis, and Integration\nIf fragmentation is a problem in SB science and its modeling, then the solution\nwould seem to be models that unify. But what does that mean? The available\napproaches include combining models, synthesizing new models, and devel-\noping families of models.\nA triumph of computer science has been to develop methods for combining\nmodels in what are sometimes called multimodels, to include doing so in model\nfederations. These methods assure interoperability and can assist in organizing\nmeaningful composition (Levis 2016; Gribaudo et al. 2019). Model federations\nwere highlighted in an earlier review of SBM (Zacharias et al. 2008); they have\nbeen pursued within the Department of Defense (DoD) since the 1990s (K\u00f6tt\nand Citrenbaum 2010), notably for training and exercising of military forces\ndistributed across the country and globe. The subject is mature enough to have\nprofessional societies and texts (Tolk 2012).\nWe are much less sanguine about using such federations to aid higher-level\ndecision-making. Good analysis requires that the analyst team understand\nand control its models. After all, the analysts are responsible for the soundness\nof their conclusions or suggestions. Using federations of models for analysis\nwithin a tightly knit group is possible, but often requires considerable code\nchecking and adaptation, not simple stapling together of models.\nThe second problem is that while the model federation approach has great\nallure for organizations seeking to improve efficiencies, such organizations rou-\ntinely desire standardization. In the DoD, for example, this led in recent decades\nto a standardization of large combat models, scenarios for investigation, and\ndatabases to feed the models. This standardization had notable value for estab-\nlishing shared baselines of knowledge, but profound problems when supporting\ndecision-makers planning military forces and capabilities for a highly uncertain\nworld. Uncertainty analysis was severely circumscribed, as was ability quickly\nto respond to decision-maker what-if questions. Because of such concerns, a\nlarge DoD modeling group was disbanded with prejudice (Davis 2016). Given\nthe current state of SB science and its modeling, the last thing needed is stan-\ndardization on allegedly authoritative models and databases. Instead, what is\nneeded is vigorous competition of ideas and rapid evolution.\n3 Definitions vary somewhat. See the website of the society for decision-making under deep\nuncertainty (www.deepuncertainty.org).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n26 Improving Social-Behavioral Modeling\nAnother profound problem with the federation approach, especially as it\nis usually pursued, is that it is often neither analytically sensible nor prag-\nmatically desirable to be working with large, complex assemblages, especially\nhigh-resolution assemblages, when conducting analysis. Instead, analysis\nrequires simpler models, albeit ones that deal with uncertainty.\nFamilies of Multiresolution, Multiperspective Models\nIn some fields, it has long been customary to develop families of models that are\nseldom used at the same time but that have known relationships and that can\nbe used to mutually inform each other and, ideally, can be used together with\nall available data for self-consistent calibration across the model family. The\nmembers of the family may differ in resolution, formalism, and other matters.\nFigure 2.1 illustrates this schematically for DoD modeling, which has different\nmodels at the engineering, engagement, mission, and campaign levels (Mullen\n2013). The number of low-level (detailed) models is large (more than a 1000),\nwhereas only a few campaign-level models exist, the purpose of which is to\nprovide an integrative higher-level view. For details, one must go deeper into\nthe pyramid. Even military modeling has SB aspects. The relationship between\nmission and campaign levels, for example, depends on the complex behavior of\nvast numbers of individuals at different levels of organization. This is affected\nby factors such as morale, physical state, discipline, and doctrine.\nExamples of model families are also possible from physics. We mentioned\nearlier the unity provided by its major theories. Much is known about how\nthose theories relate to each other and when they should be used together\nor separately. For example, the macroscopic laws of thermodynamics used\nby engineers have understood foundations in quantum statistical analysis.\nNewton\u2019s laws are fully valid in certain understood limiting cases; in some\nother cases, quantum corrections are needed; and in still other cases (e.g. on\nCampaign\nMission\nEnagagement\nEngineering\nRun Time\n(multiples of\nreal time)\nNumber of\nsimulations in use\n100 \u2013 1,000\n10 \u2013 100\n0 \u2013 10\n.001 \u2013 1\n<10\n10 \u2013 100\n100 \u2013 1000\n>1000\nDecreasing\nresolution\n(greater aggregation)\nFigure 2.1 A pyramid of military simulations.

Similarly, cases exist in which relativity theory\nmust be invoked to correct what might naively be expected to follow classic\nmechanics. This is the case when exploiting navigation satellites (Ashby 2002).\nMany examples could also be drawn from systems engineering, to include\nallowing for and anticipating emergent phenomena (Rainey and Jamshidi\n2018).\nNothing analogous to a mature family-of-models approach yet exists in\nsocial and behavioral research. This suggests questions for SBM, such as the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Can ABM be used experimentally to better inform macroscopic modeling\nsuch as might be accomplished with system dynamics?\n\u2022 Can conclusions from system dynamics research and empirical work inform\nhow most productively to go about ABM research and where regularities\nmight be expected?\n\u2022 How should modules be conceived given that it is often important to con-\nsider both issues of resolution or scale and issues of constancy as discussed\nelsewhere in this volume (Brashears 2019)?\n\u2022 When does it make sense to directly couple different types of SBM, rather\nthan have one level of analysis inform another? How is that informing to be\naccomplished? The influences should run both ways (Orr 2019).\nComposability\nAs mentioned above, achieving interoperability among models has been a\ntriumph of computer science. Achieving meaningful composition is different\n(Davis and Anderson 2003; National Research Council 2006; Zeigler and\nHammond 2007; Tolk et al. 2013; Taylor et al. 2015). At a simple level, suppose\nthat model B requires an input X, which model A is said to provide as an\noutput. A and B can then be connected and run. Suppose, however, that\nmodel A\u2019s variable X has the same label as the input to B, but actually means\nsomething different. Or, more subtle, suppose that model A calculates X using\nassumptions that seemed to the model builder reasonable, but were actually\nvalid only for the context of his immediate work, with model B requiring an\nestimate of X that comes from a different concept of how X comes about\n(e.g. is a decision based on rational actor theory or heuristics and biases?). In\nseveral of the latter cases, A and B can be combined and will run (i.e. they\ninteroperate), but the composition makes no sense. Successful composition\ndepends on the modelers understanding both context and the models to be\ncomposed. Obviously, it will be easier to the extent that the separate models are\ntransparent and comprehensible (i.e. subject to inspection and understandable\nas a whole, respectively).\nModel composition demands a deeper understanding than is sometimes\nrealized by those doing the composing. Further, pressures may exist to do a\nquick composition to demonstrate the idea without claiming validity.

That\nis, a composition should be fit for purpose. This should be much easier with\ncommunity-available libraries of well-vetted modules (including competitive\nmodules) and sufficiently rich parameterization visible at the interface. How\nshould such modules be developed, peer reviewed, and shared? We conclude\nthat two general admonitions apply:\n\u2022 No general solution exists for assuring valid composition. This situation will\nnot change with new technology. Subject-area expertise will often be neces-\nsary.\n\u2022 It is more reasonable to seek relatively general processes and procedures by\nwhich to validate a composition for a given context and to identify methods\nand tools to help.4\nConnecting Theory with Evidence\nIf theory and both empirical and computational experimentation are the pillars\nof science, it is hardly controversial to say that they should be well connected.\nTheory should inform observation, and experimentation should affect theory\niteratively and constructively. However, SB research is out of kilter in this\nrespect: the linkages are often not very strong. Improving the linkages may\nprove controversial because of deep-seated differences in philosophy between\nthose who are data driven and those who are theory driven, but examples of\nlinkage seeking occur in recent work in this volume (Gabbay 2019; Rand 2019;\nSliva et al. 2019). Another chapter discusses a structured way to do such way\n(Garibay et al. 2019).\nRethinking Model Validity\nThe Five Dimensions of Model Validity\nGiven the difficulties in measuring faithfully the many variables important\nto human and social behavior, and given the difficulty and sometimes the\nimpossibility of predicting CAS behavior, it is necessary to redefine validity\n4 The process will often involve ontologies to assure consistent vocabularies and consistent\nmeanings of variables, mappings from one set of variable names to another, and other devices by\nwhich computer science can help (Gribaudo et al. 2019). A useful formalism is fuzzy cognitive\nmaps (FCMs), which allow straightforward combining of FCMs from multiple experts (Osoba\nand Kosko 2017).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nSelected Specific Issues and the Need for Changed Practices 29\nof theories and models. Much discussion has already occurred, and it is time\nto draw conclusions and move on rather than debate the matters endlessly.\nFortunately, it is possible to proceed by merely extending the classic concept.\nAs discussed earlier (Davis et al. 2018, pp. 25\u201330), we suggest the following\nredefinition of validation:\nValidation: The process of determining the degree to which a model\nand its associated data are an accurate representation of the real world\nfrom the perspective of the intended uses of the model (Department of\nDefense 2009). Validation should be assessed separately with respect to\n(1) description, (2) causal explanation, (3) postdiction, (4) exploratory\nanalysis, and (5) prediction.\nFor the five criteria, we have the following in mind:\n\u2022 Description: Identify salient structure, variables, and processes.\n\u2022 Causal explanation: Identify causal variables and processes and describe rea-\nsons for behavior in corresponding terms.\n\u2022 Postdiction: Explain past behavior quantitatively with inferences from causal\ntheory.\n\u2022 Exploratory analysis: Identify and parameterize causal variables and pro-\ncesses; estimate approximate system behavior as a function of those param-\neters and variations of model structure (coarse prediction).\n\u2022 Prediction: Predict system behavior accurately and even precisely (as\nassessed with empirical information).\nThe criterion of description is straightforward, but causality is more difficult.\nThe concept of causality is deep, ambiguous, and debated. Whether two\nvariables have a causal relationship, and what the direction of that relationship\nis, depends on the model and context, including assumptions about what\nis normal (Halpern 2016). Effects often have multiple causes, and it seldom\nmakes sense to ask whether B is caused by A, but rather to ask whether A is one\nof the causal influences on B. Feedback effects are also common in systems.\nAs a result, it is sometimes more appropriate to think in terms of balances and\nabout different regions of the system\u2019s state space. Such thinking is familiar in\necology where the populations of predators and prey rise and fall over time.\nPostdiction (sometimes called retrodiction) can have the negative conno-\ntation of after-the-fact rationalization, but the connotation here is positive,\nthat of explaining previously observed system behavior using theory. Physicist\nSteven Weinberg uses the example of Einstein\u2019s explanation of the observed\nanomaly in Mercury\u2019s orbit. Weinberg argues that explanatory and postdictive\nanalyses are as important and persuasive in science as predictions (Weinberg\n1994, p. 96ff ). Explaining Mercury\u2019s behavior was in part persuasive to\nphysicists because of the theory\u2019s elegance, even though the agreement ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Geological\nscience, of course, also depends on postdiction. A more recent example might\nbe that economists can persuasively explain the economic crash of 2007\u20132008\nby looking at information about the state of the economy (and central-bank\npolicies) before the crash \u2013 information that was available in principle before-\nhand, but that was not adequately appreciated at the time. In retrospect, the\ncrash was avoidable (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 2011).\nExploratory analysis and coarse prediction refer to studying the model\u2019s\nbehavior over the uncertain space of inputs (also called scenario space),\nperhaps to identify regions with good and bad characteristics. The purpose is\nnot to predict what will happen, but to understand what may happen, and to\nestimate the circumstances under which various behaviors are most likely. But\nhow might one judge validity for such purposes? The primary observation here\nis that exploratory analysis (analysis across the case space implied by the values\nof all model parameters) is not useful if the model used is structurally incorrect,\nas with omitting key variables or significantly misrepresenting their effects\nand interactions. A military example would be to use a model that ignores the\ninfluence of airpower on ground-force maneuver. In the social-policy domain,\nan example would be to evaluate various urban-planning options without\nconsidering the value that people ascribe to community, parks, and safety. To\nconclude that a model is valid for exploratory analysis of a particular problem\narea, then, is nontrivial and often depends on qualitative social science as well\nas more usual methods of evaluating models. Sometimes, a model will be\ngood enough to help disentangle conflicting influences and to help motivate a\nrough understanding of events (Lofdahl 2019). Sometimes, it will be adequate\nfor recognizing high- and low-risk regions of a system\u2019s state space (Davis\nand O\u2019Mahony 2013). Sometimes, the model is deemed good enough to give\ndecision-makers valid insights about measures to consider and avoid and\nabout how to monitor and adapt as empirical information comes in (Rouse\n2015 and Thompson et al. 2019).\nFigure 2.2 illustrates how a model might be characterized in this five-\ndimensional framework. The strength of a given model along a given\ndimension of validity is measured on a 0\u20135 scale, and the result is a spider plot\n(sometimes called radar plot). The notional model characterized in Figure 2.1\nis said to be descriptive, to have a good sense of the causal variables and\nprocesses, and to be good for postdiction and exploratory analysis, but to\nbe poor for prediction. Why the latter? Perhaps the values of the key causal\nvariables are not known currently \u2013 i.e. they are knowable in principle, but\nnot currently (a circumstance common in strategic planning and science).\nThis is why so much social science is expressed in contingent terms. That\nwishy-washiness may make decision-makers unhappy, but predicting the\ndetails of future states of the world is often not in the cards. In such cases, good\ntheory is contingent, not narrowly predictive.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For example, is the model being asked whether a\npolicy intervention will have a positive effect or what the magnitude of that\neffect will be? Is the question being asked when the state of the system is near\nequilibrium and the intervention effects would be marginal and captured by\nelasticities, or is it being asked when the system is on the edge of chaos?\nA related question is whether the system has stationary behavior or whether\nits structure or basic relationships are changing (a point mentioned in a chapter\nin this volume by Kathleen Carley that also discusses validation, including\nincremental validation; Carley 2019). Weather models were long considered to\nbe statistically valid, as in characterizing once-in-a-century storms. They are\nno longer valid because the frequency of high-intensity storms is increasing,\npresumably due to climate change.

Further, polarization has increased with\nthe disappearance of moderates.\nSome General Criteria for Validation\nTheorists and modelers have been struggling with the issue of validation for\nmany years. A good deal of de facto consensus exists at the practical level. Some\nmethods apply to each of the five dimensions discussed above. Our own sum-\nmary is that judgments about the validity of theories and models are and should\nbe based on:\n1. Falsifiability (if a model cannot be falsified, it fails as meaningful science).\n2. Roots in deeper theory regarded as valid.\n3. Logic.\n4. Confirmational evidence, especially model successes in cases chosen to\nattempt falsification, but also in broad patterns of success.\n5. Elegance: Theoretical physicists are famous or notorious for their attention\nto matters such as coherence and beauty. Others look for consistency and\npower of description and explanation.\n6. Due diligence: Since judgment is involved, a key is whether due diligence has\noccurred in considering all of the foregoing.\nOur list is pragmatic. We do not attempt to define necessary and sufficient con-\nditions for validity, which would arguably be to chase a red herring because\nvalidity is ultimately about whether we have adequate confidence in the model\nfor a particular purpose.\nTable 2.2 summarizes the way we recommend discussion of model validity in\nthe SB regime (and, actually, more generally).\nStrategy for Moving Ahead\nAn earlier report (Davis et al. 2018) provided more details on our recom-\nmendations on how to move ahead in SB research. What follows is a brief\nsummary. Figure 2.3 from that report suggests a way ahead with three pillars\nof progress in social science: theory and modeling, empirical observation,\nand the newer pillar of computational experimentation. Activity occurs in a\nlarger ecology of enabling activities. The first step in moving forward may be\ndefining a few difficult national challenge problems for multiyear efforts forc-\ning interdisciplinary work and providing the concrete context that motivates\nproblem-solving.\nEach such problem would have sub-challenges: (i) tightening links among\ntheory, modeling, and experimentation; (ii) seeking better and more unifying\ntheories while retaining alternative perspectives and narratives; (iii) chal-\nlenging experimenters to find new theory-informed ways to obtain relevantDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For the purpose of comparing these options for this purpose, we\nconclude \u2013 on the basis of independent studies and workshops to debate issues and find\nholes \u2013 that the model is certainly falsifiable, has not been falsified, is logical and\nmotivated by broader knowledge, has significant empirical evidence to support it, and\nseems to characterize our knowledge as well as possible at this point in time. It seems\ngood for description and explanation, but it (and our uncertainties about its input values\nand certain details of structure) is not adequate for either postdiction or prediction. It is\nas valid as anything we have for exploring the problem across the range of uncertainties\nto decide which of the options available would be most flexible, adaptive, and robust.

To do so sensibly\nrequires defining the relevant experimental frame, i.e. specifying the conditions\nunder which the real and model systems are to be observed and how model\nresults are being used (Zeigler 1998). A model can be considered valid for a\nparticular application in a particular context if the result of using the model\u2019s\noutputs is believed \u2013 using all available knowledge \u2013 to be adequately close to\nthe result of using the real system\u2019s behavior for that experimental frame. The\ncycle continues (dotted arrow). Overall, Figure 2.4 shows a virtuous research\ncycle with a holistic view in which theory, models, empirical inquiry, and com-\nputational inquiry are all part of a closely networked system. Today\u2019s actual\nresearch process in SB work is quite different. If the idealization is attractive,\nwhat can be done to move toward it? There is need for new ideas, debate, and\nexample setting.\nImproving Theory and Related Modeling\nTables 2.3 and 2.4 list some priorities for SB research, with some of the items\nhaving been discussed earlier in this chapter. For the purposes of SB system\nmodeling, the primary focus of this chapter and the larger volume, Table 2.3\nurges an approach to theory and modeling that is closer to the science, puts a\npremium on multivariate causal models, translates context into concrete vari-\nables and cases, and confronts uncertainty seriously. Such modeling should\ninclude multiresolution, multiperspective families of models, should synthe-\nsize across current simplistic theories, and should allow translations among\ndifferent views of the system. Models should be designed to promote main-\nstay features of good science, including reproducibility, comprehensibility, peer\nreview, and iteration. Table 2.3 suggests going about this by organizing for both\ncollaborative and competitive interdisciplinary work.\nTable 2.4 lists a similar summary relating to priorities for both computational\nand empirical experimentation. It recommends moving away from statistical\nwork using data of convenience toward seeking to find the data most relevant\nto the underlying phenomena, even though doing so is notoriously difficult and\nwill require more in-depth case studies and fieldwork, as well as new methods.\nExploiting opportunities and shortening cycles are straightforward admoni-\ntions, but the next one is not.

This will require hav-\ning some more unified theories to test, as well as new data-driven methods for\nfinding such theories with computational methods.

For other purposes,\ntheory-informed work may improve better\nexplanation and better ability to anticipate\nconsequences of major changes\nUse exploratory analysis routinely Analyze computational data with the methods of\nexploratory analysis, looking at outcome landscapes\nand phase diagrams rather than point outcomes\ntypes, should be to encourage competition between theory-informed and more\ndata-driven approaches. Data-driven approaches will sometimes be superior\n(especially as artificial intelligence methods improve with respect to generat-\ning explanatory models) and sometimes faster to develop and faster to adapt to\nchanging circumstances. In other cases, theory-informed modeling will prove\nsuperior, especially for explaining, exploring, more deeply understanding phe-\nnomena, and for anticipating changes. Let the competition proceed.\nAttending to the priorities of Tables 2.3 and 2.4 requires methods and\ntechnology, some of which do not yet exist. Some priority questions for\nproviders of modeling theory, methods, and tools are: how do we do the\nfunctions called for above, such as routine multidimensional deep-uncertainty\nanalysis, variable-structure simulation, and theory-informed empirical and\ncomputational experiments? Some other examples are: how do we make the\nbest use of modern data sources, infer causal relations from observational data,\naccomplish heterogeneous fusion, and otherwise manage knowledge across\nvariations of scale, formalism, and character? So also, there are profound issues\ninvolved in finding ways to build conceptual and formal models that are com-\nprehensible to subject-area scientists and that are subject to reproducibility,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Validation has always been a\nchallenge but is even more problem when accommodating analysis under\nmultidimensional deep uncertainty and improving comprehensibility and the\nability to check composition validity.\nFinally, a pressing challenge is improving methods for aiding decision-\nmakers, which requires substantive analysis and effective communication.\nGreat strides have been made over the last 25 years related to model-based\nanalysis for complex problems, and some of the corresponding lessons need to\nbe assimilated in conceiving and nurturing research on SBM modeling (Davis\n2019).\nSocial-Behavioral Laboratories\nOne mechanism for proceeding is to have, for each national challenge, a vir-\ntual social-behavioral modeling laboratory (SBML). This might be an organized\nprogram akin to the Genome Project of years past, but we use the term labora-\ntory to convey a sense of purposeful and organized scientific inquiry to crack a\nparticular challenge (Davis et al. 2018).\nA given SBML (Figure 2.5) would exist for 5\u201310 years and would enable\ninterdisciplinary sharing and synergism. An SBML approach would not seek\na monolithic standardized model federation with approved structure and\ndatabases. Instead, the approach would be dynamic and iterative with routine\ncompetition, iteration, and evolution. Meaningful model compositions would\nbe constructed for specific purposes. The SBML activities would include both\nsimulation modeling (generating system behavior over time) and other forms\nof qualitative and quantitative modeling, to include participative modeling\nand such other forms of human interaction as gaming.5 Related conferences\nwould focus on the national challenge, the state of related social science, the\ndegree to which modeling represents that science, the products of empirical\nwork and computational experimentation, and how to characterize knowledge\nand inform decisions. Comparing lessons from multiple national challenges\nwould reveal further generalizations.\nA successful SBML approach would foster a new epistemic culture in SB\nresearch: those participating would be building knowledge in a different\nand more multifaceted way than is customary. The result might reflect not\njust scientific knowledge and craft, but also what Aristotle called phronesis\n(practical wisdom and thoughtfulness, reflecting an understanding of ethics\nand situational subtleties). The word may be Greek, but the ideas endure.\n5 Some chapters in this volume describe interactive methods that use agents (Miller et al. 2019),\ngaming (Lakkaraju et al. 2019), and simulation analytics (Swarup et al. 2019) in laboratory\napproaches.

Doing so would represent cognitive biases, the fast and slow\nmodes of thinking, and social analogues (i.e. we believe organizations and\neven societies have analogous characteristics). This should be in addition to\nmodeling that represents some behavior as having more primal basis (Pavlic\n2019).\nCAS: We recommend an emphasis on beyond-what-if simulation and analy-\nsis that asks questions such as \u201cUnder what circumstances will the optional\nintervention probably be useful and relatively free from side effects, rather\nthan making things potentially worse?\u201d This can mean major changes in the\nform of analysis based on simulation (Davis 2019). We also recommend that\nsimulation be supplemented with interactive activities, to include human\ngaming and collaborative exercises. Some of the most profound applications\nof modeling and simulation occur when they are used interactively and col-\nlaboratively so that relevant decision-makers and stakeholders understand\nand buy into the modeled representation of issues and have a substantial\nbody of common knowledge. Such circumstances are more likely to gener-\nate ways ahead that are broadly acceptable and moving developments in the\nright direction. Decision-makers will draw upon insights from modeling and\nsimulation (e.g. understanding the potential adverse consequences of actions\nand the need to plan for adaptation), but will not need to believe the detailed\npredictions of models. The modeling itself may recede to the background,\nrather than being touted as the basis for decision, but the exploratory expe-\nrience with model-generated scenarios may have a profound and beneficial\neffect (as, historically, human gaming has helped educate policy-makers).\nNarratives: Modelers need to develop effective methods for representing nar-\nratives in a combination of inputs and outputs, in part because narratives\ncan sometimes be seen as important causal factors and in part because com-\nmunicating about the system and the implications of system interventions\nwill be more effective when it connects with competing narratives. Because\ncompeting narratives are a major source of tension and conflict, SBM should\nalso seek to falsify seriously incorrect narratives in convincing ways while\ngiving visibility to alternative competing but legitimate narratives. Analy-\nsis should sometimes seek options that can be attractive under alternative\nnarratives. It should sometimes seek options that could influence the preva-\nlent narrative or options that would be effective in a societal context with aDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

All of this may require alternative agents and alternative\ndepictions of system processes. It should also be possible for research-level\nSBM to demonstrate realistic emergence of new or altered narratives in pop-\nulations, whether by conceiving them in advance and allowing the simulation\nto choose the more appropriate ones in a situation or by allowing intelligent\nagents to recognize and report on new narratives.\nWicked problems: Dealing with wicked problems must confront differences of\nvalues and perceptions, which is difficult to do in modeling without using\ninteractive methods (including gaming) to bring out the relevant tensions. In\nsome cases, the resulting insights can then be mapped into agents with the\nexpectation of simulation in which resolutions (or failures) will emerge. In\nother cases, as in the paragraph above, it will prove more valuable to think in\nterms of interactive settings, including games, with modeling and simulation\nsupport.\nAcknowledgments\nThis chapter derives from research accomplished for the Defense Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency (DARPA) as in a previous report (Davis et al. 2018).\nReferences\nAngrist, J.D. and Pischke, J.-S.

Davis 2 , and Osonde Osoba 2\n1 RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA 90401, USA\n2 RAND Corporation and Pardee RAND Graduate School, Santa Monica, CA 90407, USA\nIn today\u2019s environment, personal data collection and exploitation is pervasive.\nGovernment, industry, researchers, and society grapple with dilemmas about\nhow to make use of data to provide benefits to individuals and society while\nsafeguarding individuals\u2019 privacy and following ethical procedures. Another\npuzzle for public policy is how and when the government should collect\nor use data (and protect them), particularly when those data are already\nbeing collected by industry, researchers, criminal networks, and even foreign\nadversaries. It is difficult to develop guidelines on such matters, and it is also\nlikely that what makes sense will change over time, suggesting the need for\nadaptive policies. However, as we contemplate increasing the effectiveness\nof social-behavioral modeling and populating these models with data drawn\nfrom our everyday lives, how to balance privacy and efficacy is of paramount\nimportance. The social-behavioral modeling community needs to be informed\nby a deep appreciation of current privacy and ethical issues and be prepared\nfor new challenges that will emerge in the future.\nThis chapter is the result of a small workshop held at the RAND Corpora-\ntion in December 2016 to understand what scholars and practitioners working\nin the field of data privacy considered the most troublesome tensions, where\nstrict boundaries must be erected, and how tensions might be mitigated or\nresolved, in part with technology. Based on previous research and the work-\nshop discussions, we identified six important topics to consider for reducing\nproblems related to privacy and harms caused by misuse of personal data, rang-\ning from how individuals are notified of data use to how to deter harms arising\nfrom data use. The topics were how to:\n\u2022 Assure meaningful user notice and choice.\n\u2022 Provide usable and accurate access control.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

For\nexample, providing mechanisms for redress are intertwined with increasing\ntransparency about how data are used.\n\u2022 Single-approach solutions are unlikely to be effective. Decision-makers\nshould adopt a portfolio approach that looks for mixes of incentives, edu-\ncation, market solutions and related technologies, government regulations,\nand standards. The either-or fallacy should be avoided: it is evident that in\nmost of the problem areas, a mixed approach is necessary for success.\nWhat follows identifies priority topics for attention and action and summa-\nrizes considerations. In each case, much more in-depth work will be necessary\nin moving toward effective and feasible solution mixes that deal appropriately\nwith dilemmas and trade-offs. We include possible solution elements that may\nor may not turn out to be feasible and attractive. Some related technologies\nmay arise naturally from market forces; others are likely not to arise without\ngovernment sponsorship and/or coordination. 1\nImproved Notice and Choice\nDiagnosis\nAn approach with long precedents in legal affairs is for vendors to provide\nindividuals with long-form notices about what will and will not be done with\ntheir data (Ware 1973; Cranor 2012; Solove and Hartzog 2014). Long privacy\npolicies such as those posted on websites or in smartphone apps have been\ntypically relied to provide consumers notice about company\u2019s data protection\nand privacy practices. Individuals who use products with long-form notices are\npresumed to have read and agree with the data practices, simply because the\nnotices exist, regardless of the placement or clarity of the notice. However, long\nprivacy policies, especially with legalese and hedging terms, often do not serve\n1 The importance of these issues was dramatized in 2018 by the discovery that a private\ncompany, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly harvested Facebook data on 87 million users,\nincluding political beliefs, interests, and friends\u2019 information. In some cases, this even included\nthe full content of private messages (Frenkel et al. 2018). The issue arose in connection with\ninvestigation of Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US election. Attempts to identify remedies\nwill require dealing with all of the issues discussed in this chapter.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nImproved Notice and Choice 51\nthe implied purpose of informing the user as they are vague or ambiguous\n(Reidenberg et al. 2015). To understand and compare privacy policies would\nrequire users to spend significant time and effort \u2013 perhaps 81\u2013253 hours each\nyear just to skim privacy policies from websites that they use (McDonald and\nCranor 2008). As for granting vendors permission to use data, users cannot\nrealistically understand, internalize, and appreciate the consequences of data\nsharing practices that may be invisible and untraceable by the user (Acquisti\nand Grossklags 2005).\nAlthough notice and choice has long been an important part of privacy\nprotections in the US legal system \u2013 including being a central element of the\nFederal Trade Commission's (FTC) protection of consumer privacy in the\nUnited States (Solove and Hartzog 2014) \u2013 more recent and upcoming regu-\nlations, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR), have recognized the failure of such forms of notice and are pushing\nfor more user-friendly notices.\nWhen parties such as researchers or governments use data that are nominally\npublicly available (such as open social network profiles or content), notice and\nchoice is particularly problematic. Generally, these data are considered public\nsince they have already been shared with minimal controls on who can access it.\nIn this case, researchers may wish to use such data without providing additional\nnotice to the individual, assuming the long-form privacy policy of the social net-\nwork is sufficient. In these cases, the data subject, e.g. the person who wrote the\ntweet, Facebook post, or about whom the public record concerns, is not given\nnotice that the data will be repurposed for research, health, or financial deci-\nsions. However, reusing data ignores the context in which people shared data\n(Hartzog 2016). Data subjects may not be aware that social network data have\nbeen used to make inferences about behavior that is often considered private,\nsuch as health information (Inkster et al. 2016). People who have logged on to\na service using an account name and password may have some privacy expec-\ntations for their data and may not fully understand the implications of public\ndata sharing, including the availability and power of data reuse (Acquisti and\nGrossklags 2005).\nWe see prospects for the existing model of long-form privacy policies to mit-\nigate data harms as dismal. More recent and upcoming regulations, including\nthe EU\u2019s GDPR, have recognized the failure of such forms of notice and are\npushing for more user-friendly notices. Furthermore, technological changes are\nmaking possible more nuanced and personalized approaches.\nPrescriptions\nMany possibilities exist. These include:\n\u2022 Strongly protective software defaults that provide security protection both\nagainst malicious, illegal attacks and opportunistic privacy invasions by third\nparties.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n52 Ethical and Privacy Issues in Social-Behavioral Research\n\u2022 Standardized easy-to-understand user agreements prohibited from includ-\ning harmful permissions as a default or in order to use basic features of the\nservice and that provide transparent implications for optional user choices\nthat would increase risks.\n\u2022 Context-specific user authorization. This would require services to reask\nusers for permission to use their data as new contexts arise. This may be\nparticularly useful for technologies in which no single default setting meets\nthe majority of users\u2019 needs.\n\u2022 Tools that make it easy to review and adjust permissions and preferences\nacross programs and service.\n\u2022 Tools that alert users at the time as to how their data may be used and the\npotential or likely implications (including harms) and that offer users the\nopportunity to tighten or loosen their agreements.\n\u2022 A user privacy-authorization clearinghouse \u2013 a centralized (virtual) location\nthat maintains user privacy preferences so that users can receive notice and\nmake choice at a central point (by analogy, a few examples of information\nclearinghouses are law school applications, international financial transac-\ntions, and international police databases).\n\u2022 An adjudication process to review changes to user agreements. User agree-\nments are a contract in which currently only one side can easily modify the\ncontract. Service providers can (and do) update user agreements frequently.\nUsers\u2019 only options are to accept the change or opt out of service. An\nadjudication process, potentially under the authority of an administrative\ncourt judge, would provide both parties to user agreements, the user and\nthe provider, opportunity to control the contract.\nUsable and Accurate Access Control\nDiagnosis\nIt is important that the right people have access to individuals\u2019 data as needed\n(e.g. a medical specialist to whom they have been referred). The general\nproblem, however, is that too much information is available to the wrong\npeople at some point, particularly after sharing, sales, and interceptions of\ninformation occur over time. To make things worse, information may be avail-\nable indefinitely. This can lead to harms related to long-ago events, or news,\nfake or otherwise that never goes away, and so on (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2011).\nHowever, the ability to control access to data can be difficult not just for end\nusers, but also for more sophisticated system administrators, who may need to\ndecide who can get access to data and for how long, what the exceptions might\nbe, and how blacklists and whitelists interplay (Kim et al. 2010; Mazurek et al.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nAnonymization 53\n2010). So while access control can be difficult to implement and use, access\ncontrol might be necessary tool for protecting the privacy of the data subjects\n(Byun and Li 2008; Kagal and Abelson 2010; Raykova et al. 2012).\nPrescriptions\nThe suggestions that arise about this class of problems include mechanisms\nallowing for the right to be forgotten and managing data access permissions.\nMany have to do with attaching metadata or tags to individuals\u2019 data. While\nthese approaches can be applied relatively easily to their initial uses, enforc-\ning them when data are used in other contexts and updating them to capture\nchanges in individuals\u2019 preferences are more difficult. For example, Snapchat\nphotos disappear quickly \u2013 unless someone took a photo of the screen before\nthey disappear. Twitter allows individuals to expunge their tweets, but cannot\ncontrol access to tweets that have already been downloaded. Also, even nom-\ninally protected and encapsulated data may be vulnerable to hacking. These\nspeculative prescriptions raise questions about the extent to which, even in\nprinciple, data can be or should be erased. Possibilities (all with shortcomings)\ninclude:\n\u2022 Data expiration dates: Develop mechanisms for expunging data included in\ndatabases on an announced timetable. A key challenge for this prescription\nis attaching the expiration date to the information so that it is applied even\nif the data are copied.\n\u2022 Data access permissions for end users: Develop mechanisms to specify what\ntypes of users and uses have rights to access information.\n\u2022 Data access permissions for system administrators: Develop sophisticated\nmechanisms to understand and build complicated access control policies\nfor institutions and groups.\n\u2022 Data tracking: One of the more speculative prescriptions discussed in the\nworkshop was the possibility of an individual-specific digital ID that would\nbe included as metadata for every piece of information recorded about that\nindividual. Users would be able to track what individual data were collected\nand how they were used.\nAnonymization\nDiagnosis\nOne of the more unpleasant realities is that much current discussion about\nanonymization is based on myth. In reality, identities can often be backed out\ndespite alleged anonymization (Sweeney 2000; Golle 2006; Narayanan andDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n54 Ethical and Privacy Issues in Social-Behavioral Research\nShmatikov 2010; Ohm 2010; de Montjoye et al. 2013; Caliskan-Islam et al.\n2015). Another unpleasant reality is that with ubiquitous cameras, tracking,\nfacial recognition, and the like, the potential for individual-level inference is\ngrowing extremely fast. Although stronger methods of anonymization of data\nare available (Sweeney 2002; Dwork and Naor 2008; Davis and Osoba 2016),\nsuch approaches raise serious problems because any such method involves\na trade-off between preserving information because it is useful and reducing\ninformation to protect privacy. The availability of flexible and relatively cheap\ncomputing resources makes it easier to implement de-anonymization algo-\nrithms at scale. Which information is to be preserved depends on the particular\nactivity and context, whether research, design of medical protocols, or, say,\nterrorist detection. Moreover, emerging analytic techniques are leveraging the\navailability of massive amounts of information rather than focusing on limiting\nthe amount of information necessary. There are not yet widely agreed-upon\nstandards to determine what the right trade-off between anonymization and\nindividual data is for accurate analysis of the data.\nPrescriptions\nPrescriptions range from guidelines for how to use data effectively while pre-\nserving individuals\u2019 anonymity to strategies that individuals can take to remove\nobservation of their information. In particular, a level of data anonymization\ncould arise naturally if some people adopt multiple identities and go out of their\nway to defeat tracking and recognition methods. It is conceivable that some new\nmethods and tools for re-identification and inference could defeat countermea-\nsures (e.g. disguises, multiple identities) but would be practically feasible only\nby motivated and highly resourced agencies. Possibilities include:\n\u2022 Curated data for research and analysis: Although researchers often are con-\nstitutionally uncomfortable with anything less than all the available data, not\nall data are equally important. Speculatively, on-demand data anonymiza-\ntion tools could enable more flexible and adaptive data access. Researchers\nmight initially access limited, potentially synthetic data sets for analysis. If it\nturned out that crucial information had been excluded, an iteration could be\nmade that would provide that crucial information while still cloaking other\ninformation.\n\u2022 Digital identity makeovers: Workshop participants predicted a burgeoning\nbusiness in providing individuals with new digital identities. This could\ninclude services to expunge and/or obfuscate past information about them\nand to create the basis for new digital identities.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Many of these are referred to\ninformally as being the result of bias in data analytics. Yet algorithms and\nother data-driven systems have proven very useful at handling hard problems\neven if they are fallible.\nDiscussion of such matters is complicated by the sloppiness of language. In\nparticular, we need to distinguish among types of bias:\n\u2022 Analysis is wrong. Someone may be categorized incorrectly because of algo-\nrithms and data characterizing an over-aggregated population, an irrelevant\nsmall population, biases inherited from previous human decisions, or a lack\nof feedback and updates to a system when people or society change. Even\nwhen analysis is seemingly competent, it may be biased because the base\nrates used (the baseline frequency against which observed events are com-\npared) are inappropriate. This problem is rampant because the data for highly\ndifferentiated base rates often do not exist.\n\u2022 Results of analysis and inference are unacceptable to society, even if statisti-\ncally reasonable. Societies prohibit certain kinds of inferences because they\nhave such deleterious effects on individual rights. Examples of this often\narise in connection with racial or other kinds of profiling. Algorithms may\nbe accused of bias, but the issue is not so much the technical competence of\nthe algorithm as a matter of balancing objectives and values.\nIt should be recognized that the bias problems are real and serious (Gandy\n2010). People do suffer harm by being denied insurance (or charged enormous\nrates), by not getting a fair shake when applying for jobs, or when applying for\npassports or visas and being improperly deemed high risks (Bollier and Fire-\nstone 2010; Gangadharan et al. 2014; Office of the President 2016).\nPrescriptions\nPrescriptions for mitigating harms that can arise from using algorithms for\ndecision-making involve greater transparency, validation, and auditing of algo-\nrithms and their uses. Possibilities include the following:Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n56 Ethical and Privacy Issues in Social-Behavioral Research\n\u2022 Create transparent algorithms: Increasing transparency will not be easy\nbecause machine learning algorithms are often opaque and there is no\nclear-cut theory for reviewing them. Further, the data on which they depend\nmay have complex and questionable provenance or relevance. There are\nmany opportunities for scientific and technological innovation here, to\ninclude tests for bias (of both kinds).\n\u2022 Validate algorithms: Validating algorithms is also challenging. As anyone\nfamiliar with the concept of validation knows, validity must typically be\njudged with respect to a particular context and purpose. This means that\ngood tools must accommodate particulars of context and purpose when\nneeded: generalizations are not sufficient.\n\u2022 Audit algorithms and their use: Even if the science underlying an algorithm\nis excellent, its application practices may be sloppy or at least inconsis-\ntent. Thus, a class of prescriptions involve what we call auditing: does an\norganization using data, perhaps for social-behavioral research, routinely\nconduct audits of process and routinely test particular results to assure that\neverything is being done according to best practices?\nChallenge and Redress\nDiagnosis\nOften, people (or organizations) are unaware that their data are being used in\na way that may cause them harm. Much less are they aware of what inferences\nhave been drawn from their data (e.g. a higher propensity for cancer, for being\na terrorist, or for not repaying debts). If they become aware, they often lack any\nmechanism for challenging the results (e.g. pointing out errors and getting off\na no-fly list) or seeking redress.\nPrescriptions\nDeveloping effective mechanisms to allow for challenge and redress to occur\nwill need to build on the foundations elucidated above for greater transparency\nof process, methods, data, inference, the uses to which data is being put, and\nthe potential harms thereof. In addition, we see the need for fresh thinking and\nmechanisms for challenge and appeal (a kind of due process) and, important,\nmechanisms for redress (e.g. apologies and generous compensation). While\nthese issues were touched upon in the workshop, few concrete suggestions were\nforwarded. This may reflect the fact that mechanisms for challenge and redress\nare likely to involve policy choices rather than technical solutions and that chal-\nlenge and redress are tied so closely with notice and choice.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Within\nindustry, the incentives include professional advancement, responsibility,\nsalary, and \u2013 for the companies involved \u2013 profit and market share. Strong\ndisincentives exist for raising doubts, or pushing back. Within government,\nthe incentives include catching criminals, detecting terrorists, and coercing\nsuspects or prisoners into providing confessions or information. Consider that\nin novels and movies, it is seen as normal and virtuous for the hero to cut\ncorners as necessary to catch the villain. For scientists, the incentives include\nbeing able to answer a vexing question, discovering causal relationships, or\ndiscovering methods for, e.g. early detection of cancer. Some of the incentives\nare good; some are bad; all are very human.\nPrescriptions\nAs in other domains, deterring problems requires both carrots and sticks \u2013\nincreasing benefits and self-esteem for doing the right thing and increasing\ncosts for doing the wrong thing. It is necessary both to include active and pas-\nsive defenses (e.g. better security, better practices) and to reduce the likelihood\nthat people with access to data will abuse their access by using it in illegal or\notherwise harmful ways. One aspect of deterrence is to reduce the attractive-\nness of attempting to do what would constitute abuse. Another is to catch and\npunish those who do so. For researchers, guidelines for ethical research exist\nand continue to evolve. Possibilities include the following:\n\u2022 Increase awareness of and sensitivity to potential data harms. Serious data\nuse problems occur in part because those involved are insufficiently aware\nof the dangers, harms, and their own personal options and responsibilities.\n\u2022 Develop training programs on how to prevent data harms. Organizations\nneed to provide training in recognizing and deterring data harms. This\nwould be akin to current training on cybersecurity, discrimination, and\nhuman-research-subjects protection.\n\u2022 Increase options for tracing data across systems to understand which deci-\nsions were made based on information.\n\u2022 Update ethical principles for research in line with emerging changes in data\nand analysis. The Department of Health and Human Services has updated\nthe Common Rule specifying US federal policy for the protection of human\nsubjects. However, these changes do not fully reflect changes in risks to\nhuman subjects stemming from data and analytic innovations.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n58 Ethical and Privacy Issues in Social-Behavioral Research\n\u2022 Develop enforcement mechanisms. These can take many forms:\n\u2013 Mechanisms to challenge and demand redress for data abuses.\n\u2013 Mechanisms and protection for whistleblowers.\n\u2013 Laws and regulations that punish abusers, including officials, by fines and\nincarceration.\n\u2013 Research-grant criteria in which grantees are held accountable for data\nprotection. Precedents for this exist. Research houses have become\nacutely aware of the need to protect health data in part because of some\nwell-known instances in which large research contracts were denied\nbecause of past errors.\n\u2013 Feedback into the system: Algorithms may make decisions that turn out to\nbe incorrect; these data points need to be fed back into the system so that\nthe decisions can be revised. Naturally, there is a concern that individuals\nwho were incorrectly labeled by a system must remain tracked by that\nsame system in order for mistakes to be corrected. Thus, allowing for such\nfeedback may only be appropriate in specific circumstances.\nAnd Finally Thinking Bigger About What Is Possible\nDeveloping solutions to prevent data harms will be necessary for maintaining\nsocietal trust in and support for publicly funded research in social-behavioral\nmodeling. As a community, we need to ensure that our research is conducted\nethically if it is to remain a valuable and effective contribution to social\nwelfare. These solutions will need support, particularly from government\nresearch agencies. While many of the investments needed to accomplish the\nprescriptions discussed in this chapter are likely to focus on technological\napproaches, given the deep entanglement between technology and society, we\nbelieve social-behavioral approaches should be emphasized as well.\nLooking across all of the prescriptions, two technologically focused research\nareas appeared to us to be particularly strong candidates for government\ninvestments in data privacy \u2013 they are real challenges, they are unlikely to\nbe adequately addressed in the absence of investment, and they hold the\npromise of significant advances to deter data harms. Other challenges, such as\nadvancing data anonymization techniques, already have strong and ongoing\nresearch streams or rest more squarely in the realm of regulations than\nresearch, such as developing adjudication procedures for redress and contract\nnegotiations.\nOne promising research area is to build a context-specific data-use autho-\nrization framework to take context seriously.

As the magnitude of data and the power of big data\nanalytic techniques increase, data algorithms are playing an increasingly impor-\ntant role in decision-making. However, no commonly accepted process exists\nfor evaluating algorithms. Developing such a framework raises important ques-\ntions about technologies (how can algorithms be made transparent, what is\nrequired to validate algorithms) and responsibilities (who can be trusted with\noversight and enforcement authorities, and for what purpose).\nWe are struck by the degree to which discussion of ethical procedures and\nprivacy protections is dominated by acceptance of the inexorability of trends\nand behaviors that infringe in myriad ways on individual rights. There is need,\nin our view, for deeper systemic studies to understand how, if it chooses, society\ncould bring about major changes. Such studies would require deep looks at, e.g.\nincentive structures for business, government, and individuals and how they\ncould be changed. Can market mechanisms be brought to bear by changing\nsome incentives over which society \u2013 through its government and educational\nprograms \u2013 has some influence?\nOur current project has only touched upon privacy issues as one part of a\nmuch larger effort, but we hope that some of the ideas we have discussed will\nprove useful in stimulating subsequent result-oriented work.

While researchers in these fields may not always be conscious\nof the philosophy of science underpinnings of their work, the vast bulk of\nsocial and behavioral researchers are drawn to a middle ground when it comes\nto beliefs about the generalizability and universality of social and behavioral\ntheories. Most researchers reject both the claim that generalizable social\nscientific theories are impossible or unhelpful and the claim that theories must\nbe grounded in a universal covering law model of the scientific enterprise.\nSocial and behavioral researchers tend to work with theories that they do not\nclaim to be universal, but that they instead suggest should be generalizable\nto those contexts or situations in which the researchers expect the causal\nmechanism to operate similarly.\nThe fact that social and behavioral researchers are thus working with\ncontextual mid-level theories makes reviewing the state of the social science\ntheories challenging, and for modelers who seek to speak to researchers across\nthe social sciences, the diversity of social scientific theorizing can be daunting.\nIn this chapter we highlight key common building blocks used in theories\nacross the social sciences, focusing on three broad classes of theory: atomistic\nmicro-level theories that can explain individual behavior without reference to\nsociety or social dynamics, social micro-level theories that explain individual\nhuman behavior focusing on how social factors influence individual behavior,\nand theories of collective or group behavior and interactions.

Not only are these theories among the most important\nand widely used in the social and behavioral sciences, but also these atomistic\ntheories include some of the key building blocks used in social scientific theo-\nries of broader social interaction.\nPerhaps the most common building block in the social sciences is the\nbelief\u2013desire model of human behavior. In this approach, individual actors\nhave desires and beliefs about how they can achieve their desires, and their\nactions reflect their decisions as to how best achieve their desires in light\nof their beliefs. Belief\u2013desire models and their variants go under many\nguises. Most prominently, belief\u2013desire psychology underpins the rational\nactor model. These are models of rational actors in the Humean sense of\ninstrumental rationality, in which reason is a \u201cslave of the passions.\u201d\nThe belief\u2013desire model is also perhaps the most common folk psychology\nof human behavior \u2013 the informal models by which people commonly explain\nthe behavior of those around them. The simplest answer one can give to \u201cWhy\ndid she do X?\u201d for many people is \u201cShe did X because she wanted to do X.\u201d\nInstrumental theories of intentional human behavior typically go at least one\nstep further, suggesting that one can answer the same question by saying, \u201cShe\ndid X because she wanted Y and believed doing X would help her achieve Y.\u201d\nAmong academic disciplines, this simplistic but commonsensical approach\nto explaining human behavior is perhaps most dominant, explicit, and formal-\nized in economics. In most economic research, individual actors are modeled\nas utility maximizers.1 Formally, Della Vigna (2009) and Rabin (2002) lay out\nthe canonical approach, which can be traced back at least as far as von Neu-\nmann and Morgenstern (1944) if not farther as follows. Individual i at time\n1 There are long-standing and wide-ranging alternatives that have had some influence in\neconomics, including work that has resulted in multiple Nobel Prizes (Simon, Kahneman);\nhowever even scholars long associated with these lines of work recognize that it continues to have\nonly a niche role within the discipline (e.g. Camerer 2003). We discuss some of the key strands of\nbehavioral economics later in this section.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This equation\nis merely a formal restatement of the same idea expressed above: an individ-\nual actor will make choices at a given time that she believes will maximize\nher discounted future utility given her understanding of the world. Thus the\nframework requires understanding two key types of variables: actors\u2019 beliefs\nand desires (utility). The assumed cognitive process \u2013 whether conscious or\nunconscious \u2013 that maps beliefs and desires into choices is that actors maxi-\nmize their expected utility in light of their beliefs about the state of world and\nthe consequences of their choices.\nWe discuss below each of these components of desire\u2013belief psychology,\nwhich underpin many formal and informal causal theories in the social and\nbehavioral sciences, but before that let us briefly note four major critiques of\nthe general belief\u2013desire approach. The first two push on the framework at\ntheoretical and philosophical perspectives, while the third and fourth highlight\nsystematic efforts from within the social and behavioral sciences to modify or\nsupplant the framework.\nFirst, when this model is taken in isolation, utility maximization has been cri-\ntiqued as trivial or empty (e.g. Barry 1988). As the framework, in and of itself,\ngives little elucidation as to what beliefs or desires people hold, how they come\nto hold such beliefs and desires, and how those beliefs and desires may change,\npeople have suggested there is inadequate substance to the framework to be\nof value in understanding human behavior. Indeed, as we will see below, this\nbasic framework is frequently combined with other atomistic theories of indi-\nvidual human behavior, as well as social theories of individual human behav-\nior and interaction. To its critics, the fact that the belief\u2013desire framework is\npromiscuous \u2013 frequently combining with a wide range of theories of actors\u2019\npreferences and desires \u2013 makes it less compelling. To its defenders this flexi-\nbility of the framework is a strength.\nSecond, the key pieces of this framework \u2013 desires, beliefs, and cognition \u2013\nare for the most part unobservable, which critics suggest combines with the\nflexibility of the framework to allow almost any behavior to be explained\npost hoc (e.g. Green and Shapiro 1996). Thus critics have suggested that\nthe framework cannot be falsified: when a defender is confronted with\nbehavior that appears at first glance to contradict the framework, she can\ninvariably rationalize the apparently irrational behavior by suggesting that\nbeliefs or desires have been improperly understood.

In the standard belief\u2013desire framework,\nthinking is costless, and decision-making optimal (in light of the information\nactors have).3 Rational actors never make a mistake on a math test or have\nbad breath (cf. Cox 2004). However, decades of research point to instances in\nwhich people appear to satisfice rather than optimize (e.g. Simon 1972) and\nsystematically fall prey to a large number of cognitive biases in processing\ninformation that are inconsistent with (at least prototypical versions of )\nrationalist theories (e.g. Kahneman 2011). For the most part, most defenders\nof rationalist theories, or of belief\u2013desire psychology more generally, consider\nmany of these critiques to be friendly. Just as all maps are both simplifica-\ntions and wrong, defenders of the framework suggest that models based on\nbelief\u2013desire psychology are simplified maps of human behavior that are useful\nin many cases and that the systematic critiques mentioned are cases in which\nhaving another (more detailed) map to guide our understanding is useful.\nA fourth major line of critique of belief\u2013desire psychology grounded in\nalternative understandings of cognition is the suggestion that much of human\naction is driven by subconscious choice. If people\u2019s beliefs and desire may in\nfact result from their mind rationalizing their subconscious choices rather\nthan the choices being driven by (prior) beliefs and desires, then the basic\nbelief\u2013desire psychology framework has reversed cause and effect. Newer\n2 As a matter of pure logic, utility maximization as an explanation certainly can be empirically\nfalsified (for example, one could seek to identify situations in which outcomes vary despite\nutilities and beliefs remaining constant). However, such falsification rests upon accurate\nmeasurement of utility and beliefs \u2013 a challenging endeavor.\n3 This is not to say the decisions are correct or optimal, but rather that the decision-making\nmodel envisioned suggests that decisions made are optimal in light of the information available at\nhand as to how the options are believed to affect actors\u2019 utility. Search (information acquisition)\nneed not be costless even in the basic framework, and of course, it is common in rationalist\nmodels that lack of information can lead to suboptimal decision-making. But without a more\ncomplex cognitive model, the actual process of thinking through the choice between options\nentails no cognitive burden.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nAtomistic Theories of Individual Behavior 69\nwork on cognitive processing similarly hints that even complex actions can\nbe executed before a full decision-making process may come to conscious\nawareness (e.g. Bechara et al. 1997; Strack and Deutsch 2004; Custers and\nAarts 2010). While slightly different than the rationalization critique, it sim-\nilarly challenges the basic premise that actions are a response to deliberative\ndecision-making and reverses the order of cognitive processing.\nThis critique is deeper than a generic concern about the beliefs and prefer-\nences being driven by (inter)action rather than the converse. It is not a concern\nthat beliefs and preferences at time t + 1 are influenced by what occurred at\ntime t; rather it is that beliefs and preferences at time t in fact are rationaliza-\ntions of (effectively) simultaneous choices at time t. Fundamentally, this critique\nsuggests that people (and researchers) may be subject to false consciousness\nwith regard to what drives human behavior: our beliefs and desires may adapt\nto conform to our behavior rather than our behavior being driven by (causally\nprior) beliefs and desires. This critique is compatible with a range of alternative\nexplanations of the subconscious decision-making that occur.\nGiven these extensive and long-standing critiques of the rationalist frame-\nwork and simplistic versions of belief\u2013desire psychology, it strikes many as odd\nthat reliance on utility maximization as a framework for understanding human\nbehavior remains so widespread. Rather than provide a full-throated defense\nof the framework, at this point we should highlight two basic arguments that\nmost social scientists rely upon for not discarding the framework. The first is\na pragmatic Friedman-esque argument. Many social scientists believe that, at\nleast in the context they study, humans behave \u201cas if\u201d they are instrumentally\nrational. The second argument is that even social scientists who do not rely on\nrationalist assumptions rarely argue that we should ignore beliefs and desires\nin explaining social behavior. This suggests that even if social scientists wish\nto adopt alternative approaches still must consider the same crucial questions:\n\u201cWhat do people want?\u201d and \u201cWhat do people believe?\u201d These are the questions\nwe turn to in the next sections.\nDesires\nTo the extent that individual actors have agency and they are consciously mak-\ning choices to pursue that which they desire, an understanding of what people\nwant becomes a central concern for modeling human behavior. Indeed, bet-\nter understanding of the question of what people want (and why) is central in\nclassical philosophy, in a wide range of religious traditions, and in the contem-\nporary social and behavioral sciences. The list of approaches to understanding\ndesires is sufficiently extensive that we focus here on theoretic approaches that\nneed not be based on social interaction, turning to the social bases of human\naction in later sections.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

So a fully developed theory of\nhuman desires also must become a theory of the hierarchy or prioritization of\nthose desires \u2013 thus the emphasis in rationalist theories on developing theories\nof preferences. Theories of preferences are definitionally ordered (preferences\nentail, at a minimum a preference of X over Y), but frequently theories require\ncardinal utility functions (knowing how much actors prefer X to Y) in order to\nexplain the choices people make.\nThe most common family of theories of human desires is purely self-\nregarding theories, most of which in turn focus on materialist interests\n(although overreliance on materialistic notions of utility has long been cri-\ntiqued as well; see Mill 1863). There is nothing intrinsic to rationalist theorizing\nthat requires pairing it with materialist theories of human desires, although,\nas previously discussed, some critics have argued that rationalist theories are\nempty without being paired with such an individualistic theory of human\ndesire. However, although materialist theories need not be rationalist in either\nform or substance, as an empirical matter materialist rationalist theorizing is\nquite common in the social and behavioral sciences.\nGiven the potential importance of nonmaterial factors in understanding\nactors\u2019 utility, why do many social scientific theories rest on assumptions\nthat human behavior is primarily driven by people\u2019s desire to improve their\nindividual material well-being? A normative argument about the nature of\nsocial scientific theorizing might point to the strong norms among researchers\nconcerning the validity of such theories (more so in some social sciences than\nin others) or to a Friedman-esque argument that such theories have proven\nempirically useful in many cases, which by itself may be a pragmatic reason to\nrely on such theories. However, there are theoretic reasons that researchers\npoint to in justifying materialist understandings of human desire as a basis for\nsocial and behavioral theories. Some have pointed to psychological theories\nabout fundamental human needs, such as Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, as\njustification for a focus on materialistic concerns. At the base of such models\nof human needs are material concerns \u2013 air, water, food, shelter, etc. \u2013 that\nscholars can use to justify, suggesting that the material wherewithal to ensure\nsuch needs are met is the most central and fundamental factor driving human\nbehavior. In a similar vein, cultural materialism (cf. Harris 1968) posits that\nbasic survival needs are a primary driver of both individual behavior and\ncollective action, resulting in many of the social institutions that define\nhuman life.\nHowever, while a materialistic focus may be common, it is certainly not\nthe only basis of understanding human desires. Some scholars focus more on\nhuman biology and physiology as a basis to understanding human behavior.\nOne version of this approach is in scholarship that focuses on the biological\nand neurological basis of human behavior. To do something of a disservice toDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nAtomistic Theories of Individual Behavior 71\nthe more nuanced versions of scholarship in this line of thinking, one approach\nis to understand humans as hedonists, at least in the sense that their behavior\nis driven by what rewards the pleasure centers of their brain and a desire\nto avoid what causes pain. This approach to understanding human desires\nsuggests that understanding the science of pleasure and pain is crucial for\nunderstanding human behavior. While it is beyond the scope of this chapter\nto review the extensive literature in psychology and neuroscience that seeks\nto ground our understanding of human behavior in a biological foundation,\ninterested readers should look to the discussions in Read and Miller (2019)\nand Thompson et al. (2019).\nAnother approach to understanding human desire rests on evolutionary biol-\nogy. This work views human behavior through a broader historical lens and\nposits that behaviors that enabled the successful propagation of the species\nmust fit into the contexts that defined our evolutionary past or the environ-\nment of evolutionary adaptedness (cf. Bowlby 1969). In some areas, theories of\nhuman behavior based on evolutionary biology may overlap with either phys-\niology of pleasure/pain or psychology of needs approaches, but evolutionary\nbiology approaches explicitly place not just desire for survival of an individual\nfront and center, but desire for successful procreation and the success of those\nwho will carry on one\u2019s genes (cf. Dawkins 1976). These biological theories of\nalternative desires may (but need not necessarily) be combined with the idea\nthat human beliefs and desires may in fact be rationalizations of subconscious\nprocesses that make decisions before conscious thought even comes into play.\nOne aspect of an evolutionary biology approach to understanding human\ndesires is that it typically places certain very specific other-regarding prefer-\nences (i.e. a desire for furthering the well-being of one\u2019s genetic successors) at\na more fundamental level than the other two nonsocial approaches to under-\nstanding human preferences discussed above. We see this reflected in devel-\nopments in studying the neurobiology of altruism and social connection that\nextends the \u201cshort and brutish\u201d model of our evolutionary past to include the-\nories beyond selfishness, pleasure, and pain (e.g. de Waal 2008).\nOne clear consequence of building on any of these approaches to under-\nstanding human desires is the recognition that context matters. In particu-\nlar, each approach can be taken to suggest that when the most fundamental\nhuman needs or wants are at stake, humans are more likely to act in their nar-\nrower (often material) self-interest, whereas when people feel assured as to their\ncurrent and future material well-being, they may place greater emphasis on\nnonmaterial desires.\nBeliefs\nEven when social scientists have a clear understanding of people\u2019s desires to\nthe extent that people are making conscious decisions to pursue their desires,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The theories that people hold \u2013 their beliefs as to how\nto achieve those desires \u2013 thus are a second fundamental building block in\nsocial and behavioral theories of conscious human choice. While beliefs may\nnot play as central a role in theories of human behavior that do not rest on con-\nscious decision-making, relatively few theories of human behavior rest solely\non subconscious or unconscious decision-making.\nHow do people develop beliefs about how the world works and the (likely)\nconsequences of choices they face? There is a vast literature across a wide range\nof social and behavioral sciences on this topic, but for the most part, it is fair to\nsay that most theories of beliefs focus on how they are learned. Beliefs about the\nconsequences of one\u2019s actions may be learned through direct experience (typ-\nically this is modeled as learning from trial and error), beliefs may come about\nfrom reasoning (an internal cognitive process through which people extrap-\nolate from preexisting beliefs to develop new beliefs), or they may result from\npersuasion by or learning from others (direct modeling/instruction or feedback\nabout the appropriateness of any particular course of action).\nOne common approach to modeling how beliefs change is to treat people as\nBayesians who update their beliefs about the state of the world and the con-\nsequences of their actions following Bayes\u2019 law. When they become aware of\nnew information, they use this to update their beliefs in an optimal manner\nbased on the strengths of their prior beliefs and their beliefs about the quality\nof the new information. A vast literature explores the extent to which people\nfail to be perfect Bayesians because of having a wide range of cognitive biases\nand engaging in motivated reasoning, such that new evidence about the world\nis not incorporated into people\u2019s beliefs in a neutral fashion or in certain cases\nmay not be incorporated at all. As most of the more complex models of change\nin beliefs rest on richer understandings of social interaction, we return to this\ntopic in our later section focused on interactions.\nCognition\nA fully specified set of desires and beliefs takes social and behavioral scientists\nof a rationalist persuasion much of the way toward developing a fully specified\ntheory of human decision-making, but in and of themselves, they are limited.\nThese beliefs and desires must be processed by actors as they determine how to\nact and what choices to make. In these sets of theories, beliefs and desires are\nmapped to choices through a cognitive process.\nThe default cognitive assumption in most belief\u2013desire models of human\nbehavior is utility maximization. Desires have cardinal weights, allowing for\na fully specified utility function, actors rely on their beliefs about the conse-\nquences of choices to calculate the relative costs and benefits of their options,\nand they choose options that maximize their expected utility.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

There is no cognitive burden, nor\nany other sort of challenge to coming to a decision. And there are no mistakes\nor decisions that are not optimal, at least from the perspective of the actor at\nthe moment of the decision.\nWhile it is possible that actors may learn that past choices may have been\nwrong \u2013 at least in the sense that they may develop a belief that making a dif-\nferent choice in the past would have resulted in higher utility \u2013 decisions are\nalways optimal in the sense that the choices they make maximize expected util-\nity in light of the beliefs actors hold at the time the choice is made. While an\nactor may be indifferent between options they face, or the calculations may\ninvolve many factors, that does not make them hard or costly in any sense that\nis built into the model.\nThis simplistic version of cognition involved in canonical utility maximiza-\ntion theory has long been criticized. One of the most influential early lines of\ncritique came from the decidedly cross-disciplinary work of Herbert Simon\n(1955, 1956, 1957, 1972), whose influence spanned psychology, economics,\npolitical science, and organization theory. Simon was an empirically grounded\nversatile social science theorist whose work pointed to the fact that infor-\nmation is costly and decisions are not necessarily easy. In an informal sense,\nSimon suggested that decisions may involve so many options with unclear\npayoffs that trying to maximize utility is unrealistic and actors may prefer to\nsatisfice \u2013 latch on to a satisfactory alternative rather than search interminably\nfor that which is optimal. More recent research, indeed, finds more direct\nevidence that decisions may, in fact, be costly. In multiple studies, researchers\ndocument decision fatigue (cf. Vohs et al. 2008) and track impaired quality\nof decisions as people make multiple choices through a day. The subsequent\nliterature on heuristics (e.g. Tversky and Kahneman 1974) and additional\napproaches to bounded rationality (e.g. Gigerenzer and Selten 2002) can trace\ntheir roots to the influence of Simon as well.\nFor modeling purposes, there are multiple approaches to incorporating satis-\nficing into decision-making, at both the individual and organizational levels. At\nthe broadest level, these approaches generally assume decision-making occurs\nunder incomplete information and model a cost to searching for information\nand/or evaluating options. Thus, actors develop a threshold of acceptability\nthat determines whether they should stop searching/evaluating once they have\nidentified a satisfactory choice. There is an extensive literature in psychology\nthat highlights substantial individual variation in the extent to which people\nare satisficers or maximizers. Schwartz et al. (2002) is a particularly promi-\nnent study that finds that satisficers generally report higher levels of happiness,\nself-esteem, and life satisfaction and lower levels of depression.\nDecision-making under uncertainty also induces people to rely on heuristics\nto cut down on information search and decision-making costs (Tversky andDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Heuristics are rules of thumb\nor information shortcuts that may not be optimal, but cut down on the infor-\nmation search and cognitive burden of decision-making under uncertainty.\nFor example, while an individuals\u2019 and politicians\u2019 policy preferences may\nnot match perfectly with a particular political party, those individuals and\npoliticians may rely on party labels or endorsements and vote the party line\n(or engage in straight ticket voting) rather than investigate every option they\nmust consider in detail (Lupia 1995). While the reliance on heuristics may be\nadvantageous for individuals and at times be in the collective interest, it can\ninduce systematic biases in collective decision-making (Kuklinski and Quirk\n2000; Lau and Redlawsk 2001).\nThere are three additional dimensions of cognition that are particu-\nlarly well studied that researchers have suggested systematically influence\ndecision-making in ways that may be worthwhile for modelers to consider as\nwell: asymmetries in valuation of losses and gains (e.g. the prospect theory of\nKahneman and Tversky (1979)), inconsistencies in valuation of present costs\nand benefits relative to future costs and benefits, 4 and biases in processing low\nprobabilities and large numbers (which may have multiple neurological bases,\ne.g. Doya (2008)).\nWhile most of the cognitive models discussed above posit systematic direc-\ntions in which decision-making departs from optimization, other models of\ndecision-making have been developed in which choices are intendedly opti-\nmal but people make errors. Unlike the decisions that are suboptimal post hoc,\nactors at the time a decision is made know it is a mistake, but they pressed the\nwrong button. In some instances, theories may be agnostic as to the cause of\nerrors (e.g. the trembling hand equilibrium in Selten (1975)), although in oth-\ners there may be specific theories as to the nature of the errors (see K\u02ddoszegi\n2014, Section 6 for a review of modeling approaches to systematic mistakes in\nan economic context).\nAlternative Atomistic Theories of Individual Behavior\nWhile the bulk of individualistic theories of human desires rest on some ver-\nsion of a belief\u2013desire framework, a range of psychological theories can be\nunderstood (in certain contexts) as having an atomistic basis and may be used\nas either complementary or alternatives to a belief\u2013desire perspective. These\ntend to be theories that highlight that people differ along a range of cognitive,\n4 The experimental and observational evidence for a \u201cpresent bias\u201d appears fairly compelling, but\nthe preferred functional form to incorporate both present bias and future discounting continues\nto be extensively debated (e.g. the extensive debate over hyperbolic discounting; see also Halevy\n2008, Benhabib et al. 2010).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

People who are happy may desire\ndifferent things than those who are sad, and those who are angry may engage\nin a different cognitive process than those who are calm.\nThese sorts of emotional and personality-based theories of human desires are\nless frequently used in general social scientific models of human behavior (out-\nside of disciplinary subareas), but they are increasingly popular in the business\nworld where they are used in employee screening tools, in performance review\nmatrices, and for segmentation analyses. However, to the extent that there are\ncalls for richer models of human behavior in social scientific modeling, this is\none direction that modelers could pursue.\nSocial Theories of Individual Behavior\nNorms\nThe dominant approach to understanding individual human behavior in\neconomics is the individualistic belief\u2013desire framework discussed above,\nwhich has been characterized as laying out a theory of humans as homo\neconomicus, which can be contrasted to homo sociologicus, whose behavior\ncannot be understood without reference to the social forces that have shaped\nher over time (e.g. Elster 1989). Whereas homo economicus is pulled by her\ndesires, homo sociologicus is pushed by the norms she has internalized.\nIn thinking about norms, it is worthwhile to lay out three distinct (but related)\nusages of the concept. One way of using the term norm is primarily descriptive\nand empirical: one observes norms by looking at what behavior is normal (the\nfrequency or descriptive side of norms). A second use of the term norm is a\nsocial expectation: norms are how society expects individuals to behave (the\nsocial expectation aspect of norms). A third use of the term norm is that of\na moral prescriptive: norms are how one should behave (the moral obligation\naspect of norms). While most social and behavioral science researchers would\nno longer suggest that that which is most frequently observed is necessarily\nwhat is socially expected or morally imperative, the fact that the term can reflect\neach of these three usages reflects a historical belief among many early social\nscientists that things that are abnormal are socially and morally problematic\n(e.g. Galton).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The most natural way descriptive norms may drive human behavior is\ndue to mimicry. Mimicry can be conscious or unconscious. We may adopt the\nbehavior and mannerisms to the people around us even without a conscious\nintention to do so (\u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d). We may also consciously\nchoose to attempt to mirror the behavior around us, and this choice may be\nstrategic (driven by a belief that doing so will help us achieve our desires, as\nper the framework discussed earlier) or normative (driven by either norms\nas social expectations or moral imperatives as discussed in the subsequent\nsection). Moreover, from a developmental perspective, behaviors that were\nonce consciously learned and practiced may subsequently become second\nnature to us and require little thought or effort. For example, children learn\nappropriate personal space through direct teaching, but as they mature, these\nlessons become just part of the way we do things.\nExtensive experimental research has demonstrated unconscious mimicry in\na variety of circumstances. For example, when people are exposed to emotional\nfacial expressions, they spontaneously mimic those expressions faster than\nwould be possible through conscious thought (Dimberg et al. 2000), and\na substantial literature examines the neurological basis of such mirroring\nbehavior (e.g. Rizzolatti et al. 2001). Indeed, perceiving the pain of others\nmay stimulate the same areas of the brain that are activated when someone\nexperiences pain directly (Jackson et al. 2005). Thus we may be hardwired to\nmimic and even empathize with others (at least in some circumstances). Work\non mirror neurons (Gallese and Goldman 1998) provides a unique perspective\non how critical social engagement skills may be hardwired for our species\nsurvival.\nNot all mimicry is unconscious. It is often a conscious choice to mimic the\nbehavior of others; indeed it has long been suggested as one of the wisest rules\nof thumb to guide people\u2019s behavior. While the idiom \u201cWhen in Rome, do as\nthe Romans do\u201d has been attributed to both St. Augustine and St. Ambrose,\nsimilar aphorisms are found in around the world.5 Choices to mimic others may\nin some cases be based on conscious cost\u2013benefit calculation but may also be\ndriven by normative consideration of social expectations and/or moral beliefs.\nThe fact that certain normative behavior may be internalized and exhibited\neven when it appears to conflict with cost\u2013benefit calculation buttresses the\nemphasis many social scientists give on social norms in their theory building.\n5 In Japanese the equivalent aphorism to \u201cwhen in Rome\u2026\u201d is \u201cwhen in the city\u2026\u201d\n( ). In some languages such as Czech and Russian, the more common phrase\nsuggests that if \u201cyou wish to live with wolves, you must howl like them\u201d (Chce\u0161-li s vlky \u017e\u00edti, mus\u00ed\u0161\ns nimi v\u00fdti).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

That social norms can drive human behavior even when they\nare not in a social situation is key to the argument that norms are central to\nunderstanding human behavior.\nNorms as Social Expectation\nWhile the frequency dimension of norms is the most directly observable\nfacet of norms, most social scientific theories of norms focus on them as\nthe embodiment of social expectations. And while the is, the expected, and\nthe ought frequently go together, this need not always be the case. It is possible\nthat most norms may be like those regarding theft: norms against stealing\nthings from other people in your own community are typically strong, with\nalmost all people abiding by the norm, expecting others to do so, and believing\nthat it is the ethical thing to do. However, there can be cases in which people\nperceive social expectations that in fact are at odds with what is the behavioral\nnorm (in the frequency sense of the term). For example, adolescents routinely\noverestimate the amount of sexual activity engaged in by their peers, conflat-\ning social expectation norms (engage in intimate behavior) with the actual\nbehavioral norms (Black et al. 2013).\nSuch conflicts may arise for a variety of reasons. On the one hand, we must\nremember that societies and cultures are dynamic, and norms can and do\nchange over time, especially in response to new technologies or major shifts in\nother contextual factors (e.g. trade partners, social institutions). Alternatively,\npeople may hold to norms that govern one situation when they transition into\na new context and either miss or forget that a new set of expectations governs\ninteractions (Goffman 1959). Such frame violations (Shore 1996) are a key way\nin which norms are learned and discussed.\nAnd, of course, social expectations and frequency aspects of norms need not\nmatch up with moral prescriptions. Some social norms may be local conven-\ntions that are not tied to an ethical or moral perspective (e.g. the side of the\nstreet on which to drive), while other social norms may conflict with the moral\nor ethical beliefs of many or even most members of a society. For example, in\nmany European countries, the majority of people believe that there is nothing\nimmoral per se about public nudity, but as a matter of norms, public nudity is far\nmore circumscribed than would be suggested by the ethical beliefs people hold.\nThis example of public nudity also highlights that the frequency, expectation,\nand ethical components of norms may change differentially over time. These\nnorms dynamics tend to come about through social interaction and as such are\ndiscussed primarily in a latter section when we focus on social interaction as a\ndriver of belief dynamics.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, as individuals\u2019 moral and ethical code may not match social\nexpectations, understanding how people behave when social expectations and\nindividuals\u2019 personal normative (moral and ethical) commitments conflict can\nbecome quite important.\nUnder what circumstances might we see conflict between social expectations\nand personal ethical codes? Perhaps the most frequent normative conflict is\ncombined with social expectations: when individuals are members of multi-\nple social groups or communities that have different norms. People are often\nmembers of distinct social groups concurrently, thus leading to perennial con-\nflicts such as when people are torn between the norms of behavior among their\nfriends and their families. But people also may transition from one group to\nanother, as in major life cycle transitions (e.g. completing school and entering\nthe workforce) or migration. When social expectations of groups differ, peo-\nple may become more uncertain about the moral and ethical component of\nnorms.\nEven when social expectations are clear and consistent to a person, it is\npossible that her ethical and moral views develop in such a way that she\ndevelops an individual moral code that is distinguishable from social norms in\nthe communities she is part of. This is because culture and social norms are\nnot a rigid imprint on people, but embed themselves through the more unique\ncircumstances of each person\u2019s life. In this case, the individual may feel more\nlike Cassandra than the prototypical person torn between groups; however to\nthe extent that development of a moral code always involves the creation of an\n(in part) imagined community of ethical people to which the individual strives\nto be part of, it is not clear that this needs to be theorized in a qualitatively\ndifferent fashion than other instances in which norms come into conflict.\nThese points are elaborated in another chapter in this volume (Cowherd and\nLende 2019).\nAn additional point is that cultures build in space for conflict in social and\nmoral norms as a way to create a dynamic tension that enables the society to\ngrow and evolve over time (Turner 1995 [1966]; Nuckolls 1998). If we recall that\nmoral dilemmas are perceived as tensions between competing goods or com-\npeting evils (never simply between good and evil), this dialectic may become\nparticularly salient in moments of social, economic, and cultural transition. For\nexample, the increased salience of a pro-choice/pro-life debate was not simply\nabout changing moral or ethical norms, but came about as a by-product of\nmedical advances in fertility control and infant survival, economic advances in\nopportunities for women, and legal advances in women\u2019s rights.

The\nbelief\u2013desire framework discussed earlier sees human behavior as driven by\na logic of consequences: actions are instrumental, as actors strive to achieve\ntheir desires by choosing actions that they believe will best help them achieve\ntheir ultimate ends. Normative approaches see human behavior as driven by a\nlogic of appropriateness. People do what they perceive to be most appropriate\nin a situation given the norms they have previously been exposed to and have\ninternalized.\nIt is not difficult to understand how either approach might be seen as encom-\npassing the other. Behavior that appears consistent with an instrumental\nrationalist logic may be driven by social norms suggesting that \u2013 to an actor\nthat in this situation \u2013 cost\u2013benefit calculation is normatively appropriate.\nThus instrumental rational action could be circumscribed to situations in\nwhich norms permit such behavior. Alternatively, it may be that people\u2019s\nbehavior that appears to be driven by norms in fact results from a rational\nchoice being made by individuals. Individuals may rationally believe that norm\nabidance maximizes their individual utility (in particular instances or more\ngenerally).\nHowever, it is important to note that even if it is the case that one of these\napproaches does truly encompass the other, this may not have as much prac-\ntical effect on applications of social and behavioral theorizing as one might\nexpect. The typical efforts to encompass one theory in the other (in either direc-\ntion) result in a situation in which social and behavioral researchers still need\nto understand the particular context in which we are seeking to understand\nhuman behavior, and these resolutions will typically suggest that in some con-\ntexts, rational theorizing will be more efficient (even if rational action rests on\na normative logic of appropriateness) and in others normative theories will\nbe more efficient (even if normative action rests on a rational logic of conse-\nquences).\nWhat is likely to be more important than a fundamental resolution of\nthese competing approaches is a clearer understanding of the situations in\nwhich human behavior is driven more by instrumental logic or by a logic\nof appropriateness. Perhaps equally as important, social scientists need to\nbuild better models of how these drivers of human behavior may interact.\nIndeed, it is clear that in many cases people seek to take advantage of or alter\nsocial norms in an instrumental fashion and that people may also respondDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

There are a\nrange of modeling strategies that seek to account for the interaction of rational\nself-interest and social norms, an excellent example of which includes the\nmodels of smoking cessation efforts developed in Chapter 27 of this volume\n(Sukthankar and Behesthti 2019).\nTheories of Interaction\nFrom Individual Behavior to Social Interaction\nHumans are deeply social animals. This is fundamental and has biological roots.\nHumans have one of the longest phases of dependency among all animals, and\nwe cannot survive without intensive investment by others (Konner 2010). This\nincludes more than the provision of food and basic safety \u2013 infants reared with-\nout adequate social and emotional interaction fail to thrive and die (Spitz 1952).\nSocial scientific theories often recognize not just that social factors influence\nindividual behavior, as discussed in the previous section, but that human behav-\nior in groups is distinct from how they act when people are not around.\nWhile there is an extraordinarily diverse set of models of social interaction,\nwe highlight four key areas of the development of social and behavioral theories\nof social interaction. First, we consider two lines of social scientific theoriz-\ning and research that highlight that even apparently straightforward attempts\nto aggregate individual behavior may be challenging: first we consider collec-\ntive action and social dilemmas, and then turn to models of bargaining. These\ntheories demonstrate how relatively minimal assumptions about how social\ninteraction affects individuals\u2019 beliefs and identities result in group behavior\nthat would not be predicted based on simply aggregating individuals\u2019 prefer-\nences. We then turn to how social interaction can dynamically affect the drivers\nof human behavior, considering how social interaction affects beliefs and then\nhow social interaction affects identity and culture. These theories demonstrate\nthat understanding individuals\u2019 beliefs and identities in the absence of the social\ninteractions that shape them can profoundly misunderstand the social roots of\nhuman behavior.\nWe suggest that modelers face three key challenges in moving from the deter-\nminants of individual behavior to modeling social interaction. First, modelers\nneed to understand the micro\u2013macro distinction, and their models inevitably\nmust make assumptions about how individual and collective actors may (or may\nnot) differ. For many applications, this will require modelers to work at multi-\nple levels of analysis (for a more detailed consideration of the factors involved\nin making levels of analysis choices, see the discussion in Brashears (2019)).\nSecond, modelers must consider the possibility of recursive dynamics: they\nneed to consider whether and how to incorporate the dynamics by which socialDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Third, modelers need to determine\nthe scope of social interaction to include. Each of these challenges is apparent\nin the four types of interactive models explored below.\nSocial Dilemmas and Collective Decision-Making with Common\nInterests\nA social dilemma, broadly speaking, is a situation in which people acting in\nwhat appears to be their individual best interest make themselves worse off\ncollectively. One of the major changes in the social and behavioral sciences\nin the second half of the twentieth century, compared with the social theory\nthat predates that period, is the recognition that even when people share\nsimilar \u2013 or even identical \u2013 preferences, beliefs, and norms, social dilemmas\nare a common challenge. While most social scientists today take for granted\nthat social dilemmas are a central concern of the social sciences, this under-\nstanding is a fairly new development in the long scale of social theory and\ntheories of human behavior. To take a prominent example, whereas the bulk\nof Marx\u2019s work (and that of most other nineteenth-century social theorists)\nsimply assumes that similarly situated members of a group will work together\nin their collective interest, many of the most influential works of social science\nin the twentieth century call into question the premise that collective interests\nresult in collective action.6\nCounterexamples certainly exist: it is not hard to point to prominent\nexamples of social dilemmas in earlier social theory and philosophy \u2013\nRousseau\u2019s discussion of the stag hunt and Hobbes\u2019 explication of the\nchallenges of cooperation in a (hypothetical) state of nature are examples.\nHowever, in these examples the dilemmas are discussed as isolated in a\npre-society (pre-social contract) setting. Perhaps the most distinctive break in\nthe social sciences in the twentieth century was the emphasis on how these\nsorts of dilemmas are far more pervasive.\nGiven that social dilemmas are now widely recognized as a central concern\nand that models treating them are well established, we briefly highlight\ntwo families of social dilemmas: collective action and instability of majority\ndecision-making.\n6 Olson\u2019s Logic of Collective Action, Axelrod\u2019s Evolution of Cooperation, Coleman\u2019s Foundation of\nSocial Theory, Putnam\u2019s Bowling Alone, and Ostrom\u2019s Governing the Commons all have this as a\ncentral theme (despite their differences) and are among the 50 most cited books in the social\nsciences (http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-\npublications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/).

Self-interested actors may have desires that are best\nachieved through collective action, but even if faced with the choice to join\nin collective action, individuals may have incentives to free ride (Olson 1965).\nThis logic of collective action has been relied upon to suggest that policies\nwith concentrated costs and diffuse benefits will face more intense opposi-\ntion than policies with diffused costs and concentrated benefits (e.g. diffuse\nenvironmental benefits vs. concentrated job losses). And while the classical\nportrayal of collective action problems has been that the dilemma arises due\nto rationalist calculation of narrow self-interest, researchers increasingly have\nrecognized the role of social norms in both creating and mitigating collective\naction problems (e.g. Ostrom (2009) on the range of local strategies used to\nmanage common pool resources).\nA second, perhaps less widely appreciated, sort of social dilemma is the\ninstability of collective choice. Drawing on classic work by Condorcet and\nbuilding on the seminal work of Arrow (1950), which highlighted the theoret-\nical challenges in moving from individual ordinal preferences over multiple\nchoices to a coherent understanding of social welfare, social choice theorists\nstarting in the 1970s came to emphasize that when preferences over particular\ngoods or policies are multidimensional, there may be no stable choice that\ngarners the support of a majority (e.g. McKelvey 1979). Even when individual\npreferences are stable, collective choice may be unstable, as a majority could\nrationally cycle among multiple options.\nA simple example illustrates this counterintuitive concept. Suppose that\nthree people must agree over what flavor of ice cream to buy in the supermar-\nket. Anna prefers Vanilla to Chocolate to Strawberry. Bill prefers Chocolate\nto Strawberry to Vanilla. Cathy prefers Strawberry to Vanilla to Chocolate.\nA majority of the group (Anna and Bill) prefers Chocolate to Strawberry. A\nmajority (Anna and Cathy) prefers Vanilla to Chocolate. If collective prefer-\nences were transitive the way rationalist theories typically assume individual\npreferences are, we should thus expect that the group would also prefer Vanilla\nto Strawberry \u2013 and yet a majority (Bill and Cathy) in fact prefer Strawberry to\nVanilla. Thus whatever ice cream is chosen, a majority would support replacing\nit with a different flavor.7\nWhile easily established theoretically, the extent to which such major-\nity cycles are a major empirical challenge in understanding collective\ndecision-making has been debated (e.g. Kurrild-Klitgaard 2001). However the\nfact that aggregation of individual interests may be unstable has played an\n7 Unfortunately, Neapolitan ice cream is not a solution to all of life\u2019s problems.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The collective interest of a group may not be defined, and even\nwhen it is defined, it is not always the case that collective actors will pursue that\ninterest.\nBargaining over Conflicting Interests\nSocial dilemmas are most starkly presented when individuals have clearly\nidentified collective interests and may arise even when actors have identical\nbeliefs and desires and operate under common norms. However, in other cases\nwe seek to understand the behavior of actors with competing interests. A wide\nrange of models and theoretic approaches would fall under this umbrella,\nbut consider a simple two-actor situation in which interests are in conflict:\na fixed-sum bargaining situation in which whatever one actor garners comes\ndirectly at a cost to the other.\nInformally, analysts refer to the relative bargaining power of the two actors\nto predict outcome. In the literature on negotiation, bargaining power is\ntypically seen as deriving from the \u201cbest alternative to a negotiated agreement\u201d\n(BATNA). In practice, this bargaining power may derive from a variety of\ndifferent means: for example, if only one party can easily leave the negotiation\nand garner similar gains by bargaining with another actor, or the bargaining\noccurs in the shadow of credible threat of coercion by one party, these\nunsurprisingly give the actor greater leverage. However, bargaining power is\nnot necessarily solely a function of material power or outside options (e.g.\nScott 1985). Much of the bargaining power of weak actors may derive from\ntheir greater patience and commitment. Rubinstein (1982) developed the\ncanonical bargaining model formalizing how an actor\u2019s willingness to outwait\nor outlast another leads to the more impatient actor being willing to make\ngreater concessions.\nBargaining models, both formal and informal, have been applied to a wide\nvariety of social contexts. For example, Fearon (1995) relies on bargaining\nmodels to assess explanations for war, suggesting that only a few rationalist\nexplanations account for the fact that as war is costly, there should be incen-\ntives ex ante to strike bargains to avoid wars. From Fearon\u2019s perspective, warDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These include incentives to misrepresent private\ninformation about capabilities or resolve, a lack of credible commitment\nmechanisms, and the indivisibility of issues over which there may be conflict.8\nFearon (1995) is explicitly focused on rationalist explanations for war and\ntreats war as a discrete choice. However, if going to war is not simply a discrete\nchoice, but a series of sequential steps in a bargaining process, as in Slantchev\n(2003), war is one of many possible equilibrium outcomes, even in a full infor-\nmation model in which actors may credibly commit. Furthermore, as Fearon\n(1995) recognizes, if the choice by states (which are collective actors) is not\nabout maximizing some version of their collective good, but the interests of\nindividual decision-makers, it may be that war is in the interests of leaders even\nwhen it is not in the interest of the state as a whole. Thus, models that define\nthe scope of the decision or the nature of actors differently might result in very\ndifferent results.\nIn addition, a sizable literature in a number of disciplines has suggested\nthat social and cultural norms, including norms of fairness, influence human\nbehavior in bargaining contexts, suggesting that the assumptions of the\nbargaining used by Fearon may not be universal. For example, Gintis (2009)\nsuggests norms of inequity aversion and (strong) reciprocity are crucial to\nincorporate in social scientific models of bargaining and interaction, and the\nwork of Henrich (2004) and his work with various colleagues provide strong\nevidence of systematic cross-cultural variation in bargaining behavior that\ntypical rationalist models fail to capture. Henrich et al. (2010) go even further\nin noting the strong biases and limitations inherent in the bulk of social\nscientific research that has both built theory and tested empirics based on\nWestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations.\nHenrich et al. (2010) note that there is a growing recognition in the social and\nbehavioral sciences that many of the cognitive and motivational processes that\nthe scholarly literature has previously assumed to be universal may be in fact\nbe more context bound than has been appreciated.\nSocial Interaction and the Dynamics of Beliefs\nWhile the drivers of individual human behavior \u2013 desires, beliefs, cognition,\nnorms, emotions, and personality \u2013 are frequently taken as fixed, essentially\nevery theoretic approach suggests that they can be influenced or even deter-\nmined by social interaction. Dynamic models that incorporate change in these\ncharacteristics as a consequence of social interaction thus are particularly\nimportant in improving the match between models and social scientific theory.\n8 The indivisibility of particular issues should only undermine bargaining when divisible side\npayments of sufficient value are unavailable to compensate for the indivisible issues.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Most people currently believe the Earth is round because\nof social interaction (what they have learned from others, what others believe,\netc.) rather than because they have clear personal experience or have done\nexperiments or carefully reasoned this out from evidence they themselves\nhave experienced. If your neighbors do not believe in unidentified flying\nobjects (UFOs), anthropogenic climate change, or the health benefits of eating\nvegetables, you are less likely to believe in them.\nThe relevant question among social and behavioral scientists is not whether\nsocial interaction influences beliefs, but rather by what mechanisms it does so,\nand whether this dynamic is important to include in a given model. In this\nsection we briefly explore four basic mechanisms through which social interac-\ntion might influence beliefs: mimicry, Bayesian updating, motivated reasoning,\nand social persuasion.\nPerhaps the simplest mechanism is mimicry. As discussed earlier, the basic\nlogic is that people\u2019s beliefs will come to mimic those of the people around them\nover time. The cognitive theory underpinning mimicry may vary: it may be\nconscious or unconscious, driven by adaptation to social expectations, ratio-\nnal self-interested calculations, etc. But from a modeling perspective, changes\nin an individual\u2019s beliefs can be simply modeled as a function of (probabilistic)\nadoption of the beliefs of people they interact with (see Osoba and Davis (2019),\nin this volume, for a more sophisticated example regarding meme propagation).\nAnother common approach to modeling changes in beliefs is to assume that\nactors are intendedly rational when it comes to assessing the evidence for their\nbeliefs and that they update those beliefs according to Bayes\u2019 rule (adjusting\ntheir prior beliefs in accordance with the relative strength of new evidence\nthey may come across as a result of new experiences and new interactions).\nFor example, the contact hypothesis (aka intergroup contact theory; e.g. All-\nport, 1979 [1954]), which suggests that intergroup prejudices can be reduced\nthrough positive social interaction between members of different groups and\ncan be interpreted as reflecting individuals updating their beliefs about others\nin a Bayesian fashion (e.g. Lupia et al. 2015).\nHowever, neutral Bayesian models of information updating have been exten-\nsively critiqued, with the bulk of the psychological and cognitive literature\nsuggesting that people exhibit a wide range of biases in updating their beliefs.\nPerhaps most extensively studied is various forms of motivated reasoning\n(Kunda 1990), including confirmation bias (Nickerson 1998). People tend\nto seek out information that confirms their prior beliefs, contributing to\nselection bias in the information an actor receives. Furthermore, when faced\nwith evidence that conflicts with their beliefs, they tend to counterargue, while\nuncritically accepting evidence that reinforces their prior beliefs (Taber andDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Motivated reasoning and biased updating have consequences\nranging from political polarization in an era of greater media diversity (Stroud\n2010) to people tending to be overly optimistic in estimating of how long tasks\nwill take (Buehler et al. 1997).9\nReviewing the psychology literature on social influence and persuasion,\nWood (2000) suggests that changes in attitudes and beliefs occur from three\nprimary mechanisms, including two normative mechanisms: (i) ensuring\nbeliefs about the self are coherent and favorable, (ii) ensuring good relations\nwith others (given the rewards and punishments they can provide), and one\ninformational mechanism: (iii) a desire to hold beliefs that conform to reality.\nThus persuasion and social influence may occur along multiple tracks, with,\nfor example, those seeking to influence others appealing to various aspects of\nidentity and social ties, as well as tying their appeals to empirical evidence.\nThese multiple tracks of influence and persuasion are well understood in\nbusiness and marketing. Sales pitches for cars are almost never solely based\non providing information that a neutral Bayesian will use to update her beliefs\nabout whether to buy a car, and if so, which to purchase. Rather, advertise-\nments highlight how the vehicle would reinforce a positive self-perception (e.g.\ncertain SUV advertisements reinforcing a rugged outdoor sports self-image)\nand enhance the positive perception of a person by others (e.g. the number of\ncar commercials in which the purchase of a new vehicle apparently leads to\ngreater adoration by a devoted spouse and the awe of coworkers). The goal is to\nsell more cars by influencing beliefs about how certain cars are associated with\npersonal identity, self-worth, and social esteem.\nWhile the literature on how beliefs change in response to social interaction\nis well established, the consequences for modelers will vary based on the social\nphenomena modelers seek to understand. While beliefs are clearly influenced\nby social factors, beliefs can be resistant to change due to motivated bias and\nadditional reasons for status quo bias discussed in Samuelson and Zeckhauser\n(1988). Thus, one of the most important decisions a modeler must consider is\nwhether including the possibility of dynamic change in beliefs in a particular\nmodel will be valuable.\nSocial Interaction and the Dynamics of Identity and Culture\nTo many social scientists, identity is more than a set of beliefs: identity\nis intrinsically a social phenomenon, i.e. something constituted primarily\nthrough social interaction. Crucially, an individual\u2019s identity is understood\nthrough how that person situates themselves vis-\u00e0-vis the various groups to\n9 This, of course, is not something that would ever apply to the writing of this chapter (or any\nother project any of the authors have ever been involved in).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Understanding and modeling identity thus becomes\na challenge of understanding a person\u2019s relations with a wide range of groups.\nAt the crux of this challenge lies the idea of boundaries: When, where, and\nhow are social groups defined? Where does one group end and another begin?\nWhat is entailed in joining or being a member of the community? What are the\ndynamics that produce new communities or mobilize existing ones? How do\nthe boundaries between groups flex and shift? What drives those changes?\nThese questions \u2013 long a concern of anthropologists and sociologists \u2013\nbecome increasingly complex and urgent in our hyperconnected world. We\nmust recognize that, however defined, boundaries are fluid, flexible, and\noverlapping. When effects of American policies and media permeate daily\nlife in countries across the globe, just as Japanese anime and Al-Jazeera\npercolate through US communities, researchers must question the value\nof traditional bounded communities from an analytical standpoint. Can we\nidentify something distinctive as American vs. Korean among cohorts of young\npeople whose lives are parallel on many fronts?\nOne way to address these questions is to assume that identities are neither\nequal nor neutral, but are experienced and managed by people in accordance\nwith hierarchies, relations of power and prestige, and ability to control the\npresentation of self (Goffman 1959) in different circumstances. How people\nrepresent race in the U.S. Census is one relevant example of how even allegedly\nfixed categories shift over time (Harris and Sim 2002). To address these ques-\ntions, researchers must understand why people tie allegiance to some models\nof identity over others in situations of competing demands. Research on\ncognitive and cultural motivated models (Holland and Quinn 1987; D\u2019Andrade\nand Strauss 1992) and acts of meaning (Bruner 1990) is part of more recent line\nof work aimed at establishing broader theories about how humans negotiate\nand create self amid competing social categories.\nHow might these approaches be useful for modeling? Understanding how\npeople prioritize and align to different identities in different situations is impor-\ntant for modeling dynamic change. For example, we may hypothesize that a\nparticular identity will become the grounding/salient driver of behavior when\nit is the marker of difference for those in a minority role: a woman physicist will\nbe more cognizant of her status as a woman when at a professional conference\ndominated by men, whereas she may be more cognizant of her status as a pro-\nfessional physicist when among a group of at-home mothers. Alternatively, we\ncan hypothesize that people seek out points of connection to others when they\nare in the minority category; the dominant behavioral expectations will govern\nbehavior. Both hypotheses, while essentially positing opposite dynamics, could\nbe born out through research and data and then modeled into a simulation that\ndoes not assume all identities are equally interchangeable.\nThe focus on the idea that identity drives behavior \u2013 that is to say, the ideas,\nattitudes, and beliefs that people hold about themselves and others shape andDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Failure to abide by a code of conduct for one\u2019s chosen\nrole/identity will often inspire social groups to take efforts to bring individu-\nals back in line, enforcing and reinforcing the power of the social expectations\nside of norms.11\nHowever, identity may similarly change in response to new behaviors.\nLightfoot\u2019s (1997) work on the way risk-taking behaviors shape adolescent\nsocial group dynamics, and thus each teens\u2019 perceptions of herself, is a nice\nexample of identity responding to behavior: when teens refused to cross\nnew risk lines with their peers, they shifted identity from one social network\nto another. We see similar findings in Csordas\u2019 (1997) study of charismatic\nCatholics and Masquelier\u2019s (2001) work on bori possession cults in Niger, in\nwhich unexplained behaviors drive the search for a new identity that better\naligns and explains the behaviors. Luhrmann\u2019s work on schizophrenia and\nprayer (2012) is a fascinating example of how people align new behaviors to\nspecific social categories and thus transform something that is a disorder into\nan acceptable path.\nThis line of research may in part help explain the common not me response\nin the wake of everything from gang rapes to soccer mobs to raves or even\nmarathons. Specifically, in post hoc reflections on such experiences, partici-\npants often cite that their behavior was atypical and unusual given their past\nhistory. Such responses are challenging for rationalist models of behavior\nbecause people behave in ways that they themselves describe as nonsensical\nand suggest an important area in which more common models of social\ninteractions come up short.\nEven in areas like the interactive evolution of group identity and cultural\ninformation, which have long been central in sociology and cultural anthropol-\nogy, there remains a great deal of room for the development of more sophisti-\ncated models. These topics are explored further in Cowherd and Lende (2019)\nand Matthews (2019) later in this volume.\nFrom Theory to Data and Data to Models\nEven the most cursory overview of social scientific theories should make\nclear at least two interrelated challenges for the collection of data for\n10 At a fundamental level, this makes intuitive sense as we look at people who change their\nbehavior to align with their identity. For example, religious renunciates explicitly align their\nactions to conform with a particular chosen identity, as do military personnel, the newly married,\nand new parents. A more developmental take on this dynamic include studies of gender and racial\nbias among young children in which they self-limit their actions based on perceptions of what is\nacceptable for kids \u201clike me\u201d (Maccoby 1988; Witt 1997). In every case, the role/status assigned to\na person is expected to drive behavior.\n11 The nail that sticks out will be hammered back in (in Japanese, ).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

First, almost all of the crucial moving pieces of\ntheories of human behavior are mental states that are unobserved and often\nintrinsically unobservable. Working with concepts that can only be measured\nthrough imperfect proxies is not unique to the social and behavioral sciences \u2013\nit is common throughout the sciences. Second, the extent to which theory\nand measurement of data in the social sciences are context dependent is all\ntoo frequently overlooked or misunderstood. The combination of unobserved\nmental states and often unclear context dependency means that social science\nresearchers typically are working with data for their key concepts that are weak\nproxies and may have limited external validity.\nTo take a simple example, consider how we can learn people\u2019s desires (one\nof the most frequent mental states social scientists wish to understand). One\ncan derive some ideas from theory, but there often exist competing theories,\nand the theories are rarely specific enough to generate either universal or\ncontext-specific cardinal values for the weights people place on their various\ndesires.\nSo, if people\u2019s desires matter, how do we overcome this challenge? Multiple\napproaches exist, but they most frequently boil down to first-person explica-\ntion, third-party interpretation, or revealed preferences \u2013 that is to say, our\nempirical evidence about what a social actor wants is based on what that per-\nson says, on what another person says, or on behavior that the analyst believes\naccurately reveals what the person wants.\nTo take a prosaic example, how does a parent know what his 10-year-old child\nwants for dinner? Well, the child might announce as the parent picks her up\nfrom school, \u201cI want sushi for dinner,\u201d and most people would take that as fairly\nclear evidence that was what the child wanted. And if she does not announce it,\na parent (or a researcher) could ask her. Of course, it is clear that these speech\nacts may not be true revelation of desires, but may intentionally 12 or uninten-\ntionally13 fail to accurately capture what the child wants. And often researchers\nare interested in the desires of people with whom they cannot interact for whom\nthere is no detailed record of stated preferences.14\nOverreliance on first-person explication of desires can also bias the subjects\nwe study. A 10-year-old child may be very vocal about her desires, but when\nshe was 10 months old, her parents could not necessarily expect her to tell\nthem what she wanted for dinner \u2013 at least not in words. At times like this\n12 This may be strategic misrepresentation of desires. For example, the child may not actually\nwant sushi but knows that getting her parent to say no makes the parent feel guilty and thus be\nmore likely to indulge her in other ways.\n13 This may be false consciousness: i.e. the child may believe she wants sushi for dinner, but she\nin fact does not truly want sushi for dinner.\n14 Although perhaps with the move to much richer big data more may be possible than was in\nthe past.

New parents\nintroducing foods to a 10-month-old might ask other parents or a pediatrician\nwhat foods their child would like. Social scientists frequently ask third parties\nor experts their informed opinion about the mental states of subjects of interest,\nand this entails many of the same challenges as to reliance on first-party expli-\ncation: the measurements are filtered through the a third-party perspective \u2013 a\nperspective that is, at best, differently subjective than a first-party explication of\nmental states. And concerns about strategic misrepresentation and false con-\nsciousness still arise.\nHow do experts develop beliefs about the mental states of human subjects?\nThe same way social scientists do: through a rough mix of extrapolation from\ntheory, projection of their own mental states to others, and drawing on a\nlifetime of inferring mental states from human behavior. Revealed preferences\nare perhaps the most commonly relied-upon source of information regarding\npreferences, but they too face comparable challenges to the other approaches.\nWhile we might infer that a 10-month-old child does not like the latest blended\nmush being offered because she pushes it away or onto the floor, we typically\nwish to make inferences about mental states for something beyond the\nimmediate context. Is the 10-month-old refusing pumpkin\u2013squash\u2013blueberry\nfor dinner making only a simple comparison (eating the bland blend vs. no\nfood)? Or is a 10-month-old sufficiently cognitively developed that the fact\nthat she had the much tastier apple\u2013banana\u2013spinach mush for lunch and\nliked it consciously or subconsciously influences this decision? One might\nimagine that pushing away the bland blend could increase the probability of\ngetting more of the food that was previously a hit. The behavior may not be a\ntrue preference revelation that pumpkin\u2013squash\u2013blueberry is less desirable\nthan no food, but in fact a strategic gamble that pushing it away increases the\nlikelihood of receiving apple\u2013banana\u2013squash.\nSocial scientific disciplines have emphasized different data sources to a differ-\nent degree. In economics, the emphasis in most subfields has been primarily on\nhow the researcher can interpret choices and actions in terms of revealed pref-\nerences. In some branches of psychology, researchers have typically adopted\nthe role of expert and assess for themselves what humans want, need, or desire\nin a particular context. In contrast, anthropology has long held that people are\nthe experts on their lives, and the work of the ethnographer is not to reinterpret\nreports about choices, beliefs, and so on, but to provide the contextual frame-\nwork within which such reports make sense. Ultimately the sources for data\nregarding the mental states that form the fundamental building blocks of most\nsocial scientific theorizing are often both crude and imprecise proxies for the\nunderlying concepts, and the external validity of the measurements is highly\ncontext dependent.\nGiven the inherent challenges in measuring mental states discussed above,\nmuch of the empirical work in the social sciences is behaviorist in the sense thatDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While a theory linking civil war to relative economic deprivation\nwill likely ultimately involve the mental states of members of different groups in\na society, a researcher might simply black-box that relationship in their analyses\nand test for a relationship between (observed) relative economic deprivation\nand (observed) civil war. This behaviorist approach has the advantage of not\nrelying on data on unobservables.\nHowever, to the extent that key links in a causal chain are black-boxed, we\nhave difficulty distinguishing between theories that give similar predictions\nfor the observed outcomes but may have different theoretical or policy\nimplications. For example, an observed association between relative economic\ndeprivation and civil war might be driven by beliefs held by members of\nmarginalized socioeconomic groups that civil war is superior to the status\nquo in terms of extracting economic benefits for their group relative to other\ngroups (a materialist group conflict model). Or perhaps the empirical pattern\nresults from beliefs about violation of certain societal norms (a normative\nsocial contract model). While the empirical pattern might appear the same, the\ndistinct mental models underpinning the observed correlation could very well\nsuggest different policy prescriptions for helping resolve or prevent civil wars\nand could have different implications for models predicting civil war. When\nour research fails to get at the actual mechanism(s) that underpin empirical\nrelationships we seek to understand, the value of our research is ultimately\nmuch more limited.\nThe rise of new sources of data, and the scale of data we can now analyze, may\nsuggest a greater opportunity to draw on empirical evidence to parameterize\nmodels. While we believe this to be the case, the rise of big data has not obviated\nthe intrinsic challenges entailed in properly collecting and understanding social\nscientific data. Fundamentally, the challenge of inferring unobserved mental\nstates from imperfect proxies remains, and new sources and greater quantities\nof data do not change this. Modelers must choose between relying on imperfect\nmeasures and relying on untested assumptions about key components of the\nsocial and behavioral dynamics that they explore.\nWhile detailed discussion of the challenges of going from data to models is\nbeyond the scope of this chapter, the fundamental importance of understanding\nthe data-generating process that underlies measures is difficult to underesti-\nmate. Modelers need to be particularly concerned with the validity of the data\nthey use to parameterize any model across three dimensions: concept validity,\nmeasurement validity, and external validity.\nIn thinking about concept validity, modelers need to consider the correspon-\ndence between what the concept they are modeling and the measure they are\nrelying on. For example, empirical indicators of mental states can be affected\nby multiple unobserved factors. Indicators of aggressive anger may also par-\ntially be measuring fear.

Data collected\nfrom small samples or from particularly noisy processes may exhibit greater\nrandom variation, and the assessment of the validity of data that purports to\nmeasure unobserved mental states is particularly challenging, because there is\nno objective standard by which to validate the measure. For example, relying on\nspeech as a true representation of a mental state without accounting for how\nspeakers may tailor their speech to different audiences runs substantial risks of\npropagating measurement bias into a model.\nFinally, modelers must consider concerns of external validity. In some ways,\nthis is the most crucial concern, given the emphasis in the social sciences on the\ncontext-dependent nature of both empirical and theoretical research. Model-\ners who wish to draw on empirical data, like all other researchers, must grapple\nwith the challenge of generalizing from measures taken in a particular time and\nplace to other contexts. While visible behaviors in discussion among friends\nand family might candidly reveal anger or angst, the same person\u2019s emotions\nmight be suppressed or expressed differently when interrogated by authorities\nor enemies. The expression of political attitudes may be quite different dur-\ning wartime, election campaigns, and economic booms (to highlight just three\ndistinct contexts).\nUltimately, two of the key challenges of theorizing in the social sciences \u2013 that\nmost theories rest on factors that are unobserved and potentially unobservable\nand that most theorizing is mid level and bounded \u2013 present serious challenges\nto researchers who simply might wish for the data to speak for itself. Model-\ners thus need to take care to understand any data they wish to incorporate in\nparameterizing or empirically assessing their models. While these problems\nmay seem basic and perhaps even trivial to some readers, in truth they are\nenduring challenges intrinsic to social science research and modeling efforts.\nFor more detailed consideration and applied examples, the discussions in both\nCarley (2019) and Grace et al. (2019) in this volume consider the challenges of\nvalidating models using empirical data in more detail.\nBuilding Models Based on Social Scientific Theories\nSocial scientific research builds on a wide range of theoretic building blocks.\nThis chapter has discussed many, including beliefs, desires, cognitive pro-\ncesses, norms, emotions, personality, and identity. Even so, the discussion in\nthis chapter still gives short shrift to several important topics considered in\ndetail in other chapters of this volume, including culture and the neurologicalDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While the former point may be frustrating for developing and\ntesting general social science theory (just as the limits of physical observation\nhamper our ability to develop a more unified set of physical laws), it is the lat-\nter point that is most crucial for most modelers and social scientists. This is\nbecause most social scientists and modelers are more like builders than theo-\nretical physicists.\nBuilding a sturdy home does not require knowledge of subatomic physics.\nA builder needs to know which building materials go together well and are\nsuited to the local environment. Houses built in different climates often rely\non different techniques and materials, and when builders move, their preferred\nmaterials are often less well adapted to their new conditions. And yet, borrow-\ning building materials, techniques, and styles developed in other environments\nis one of the most powerful forces for innovation and advancement in architec-\nture and construction.\nIn the social sciences we see a similar dynamic. It is at the interstices of\ndisciplinary boundaries where researchers draw on new types of building\nblocks and often push fields forward. For example, in recent decades in\neconomics, behavioral economics, political economy, and neuroeconomics all\nhave become active and innovative subfields. We should not expect all such\nefforts at cross-disciplinary construction to be successful \u2013 efforts to incorpo-\nrate distinct building styles or materials often lead to spectacular architectural\nfailures. But over time these efforts are crucial in driving innovation in the\nsocial sciences.\nThe other major source of innovation in the social sciences (and in architec-\nture) is the development of new technology. Over the past century, the rise of\nexperimental social science, developments in sampling theory, and advances\nin computing all have dramatically altered social scientific and behavioral\nresearch. We have tools to observe, measure, and analyze social behavior today\nthat social scientists a century ago did not even dream of. Opportunities to\nleverage new technology are likely to continue to drive innovation in social\nscience in the future.\nModelers are particularly well suited to identify opportunities to leverage\ntechnological innovations and interdisciplinary perspectives in the social\n15 We commend to readers the discussion in other chapters of this volume of culture (Matthews\n2019), motivational systems (Read and Miller 2019), and neuropsychological bases of behavior\n(Thompson et al. 2019).

Most social scientists are firmly ensconced in their discipline;\ntheir research relies on well-established building blocks that are perceived\nto be appropriate and (hopefully) well suited to the disciplinary terrain. In\nkeeping up with advances in modeling, modelers are inevitably exposed to\ncross-disciplinary perspectives and technological developments that may not\nbe as visible to those who are primarily based on a single social scientific\ndiscipline.\nThe fragmented nature of social scientific theorizing can be frustrating. And\nyet the diversity in conceptual building blocks generates opportunities for cre-\native and innovative modeling that draws on these building blocks to improve\nour understanding of social and behavioral dynamics.\nAcknowledgments\nThis chapter builds on many conversations that the authors have had, both\nwith each other and with colleagues and students over the years. In particular,\nthis chapter draws on many years of teaching social science theory to political\nscience graduate students at the University of British Columbia, conversations\nwith members of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research\u2019s interdisci-\nplinary Institutions, Organizations and Growth Program, and wide-ranging\nconversations that took place at a workshop focused on the frontiers of social\nscience modeling held at RAND in Santa Monica in April 2017.\nReferences\nAllport, G.W.

A New Approach to Defining\nLevels of Analysis for Modeling Social Science Topics\nMatthew E. Brashears\nDepartment of Sociology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA\nIntroduction\nWhen modeling social processes, what level of analysis is most appropriate?\nShould we stand back to a macro-level and treat nation-states as unitary enti-\nties? Should we stand at the micro-level and attempt to model the knowledge,\nmotivations, and choices of millions of simulated actors in the hope that they\naggregate into consistent results? Or should we try to locate ourselves some-\nwhere in between, in the meso-level, where predictions are easier and data\nrequirements are lighter? The answer is critical to producing useful results, but\nit is often not obvious which level of analysis offers the most promise. This prob-\nlem is further exacerbated by the fact that each descriptor, micro-, macro-, and\nmeso-level, applies to a range of scales rather than just one, depriving these\nterms of analytic precision. Here, I argue that the appropriate level of analy-\nsis is often difficult to identify because our concept of levels is inadequate. The\nappropriate level of analysis depends not solely on the size of the subject to be\nmodeled but also on the constancy of the system itself, or the degree to which\nits behavior varies between fully determined and complex. By explicitly con-\nsidering the interaction between the size and the constancy of the system, we\nimprove our ability to build rigorous social science models.\nThese challenges are worth confronting because the construction of accurate\npredictive social science models is of primary importance. The key existential\nthreats facing society in the twenty-first century, including global climate\nchange and transnational terrorism, reflect the unintentional by-products of\nour highly developed physical technology. The legacy of the industrial revo-\nlution and medical advances permitting rapid population and consumption\ngrowth can literally be felt in rising global temperatures. Likewise, improve-\nments in chemical, biological, and nuclear technology make greater levels\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

These threats can be\nreduced in part through better technology (e.g. improved radiation sensors),\nbut to a large extent their solutions require social change (e.g. decreased carbon\nfootprints, demobilization of hostile forces, verification of arms agreements).\nAs such, the critical frontier for science in the twenty-first century is firmly in\nthe realm of the social.\nIn the remainder of this chapter, I begin by reviewing how levels of analysis\nare usually regarded in the social sciences. I draw attention to how this concep-\ntion is inadequate in many instances and especially how it creates difficulties\nwhen attempting to produce reliable models. I argue for a revised perspective\non levels of analysis that attends to both scale and constancy. While I cannot\nclaim to have solved the problems of multi-level modeling in social science, this\nchapter will hopefully spark fruitful consideration of how new conceptions of\nlevels are necessary in order to make progress.\nTraditional Conceptions of Levels of Analysis\nWhat level of a phenomenon should a scientist focus on? All scientific disci-\nplines grapple with issues of scale. For example, the behavior of steel beams\nin a bridge is partly dependent on the behavior of individual molecules in the\nbeams\u2019 structures. In turn, the behavior of these molecules depends upon their\nconstituent atoms, subatomic particles, and perhaps vibrating strings. Like-\nwise, the behavior of human collectivities, including nation-states, cultures,\nsocial movements, and mobs, is at least partly determined by the behavior\nof smaller constituent elements (e.g. individuals). International alliances are\nshaped by the behaviors of countries, which are shaped by the behavior of\ntheir civil societies, which are shaped by smaller communities, which are made\nup of individuals, who possess specific thoughts, feelings, desires, and beliefs.\nIn short, almost every phenomenon in nearly any science rests upon a set of\nnested smaller elements and in many cases supports a further set of nested\nlarger elements. On what level should one focus? For many social sciences, this\nissue of scale is what is most often referred to as level of analysis: the decision\nof how large a social entity one will attempt to describe, explain, and predict\nand with how much detail.\nIn social science disciplines, levels of analysis are most often referred to as\nmacro-, meso-, or micro-level. The macro-level encompasses large social for-\nmations (e.g. nation-states, cities) and studies them as, essentially, coherent\nentities. At this level, the beliefs and ideas of individual people are typically\nviewed as irrelevant or as outcomes of larger-scale processes.

Certain social science dis-\nciplines are sometimes thought of as having an affinity for particular levels, such\nas psychology with the micro-level or political science with the macro-level, but\nthis affinity is more apparent than real. Relevant processes (e.g. voter behavior)\noften happen off of the supposedly native level of analysis for a discipline. Like-\nwise, certain disciplines, such as sociology and economics, consciously span all\nlevels (e.g. microeconomics, which deals with individual economic decisions,\nand macroeconomics, which grapples with the function of entire economies).\nThe centrality of the level of analysis is often far greater than the attention it\ngarners. This is somewhat surprising in that the level of analysis fundamentally\ndetermines the units that will be studied, as well as the types of measurements\nthat can be used, and by extension the kinds of conclusions that will be reached,\nthus making it one of the most consequential decisions in the research pro-\ncess. Moreover, questions of proper level of analysis are often confused with\nother related issues. This can be observed in the study of social networks, where\nthere has been much discussion of the boundary specification problem (Lau-\nmann et al. 1992). The boundary specification problem refers to the difficulty\nin determining which nodes should be regarded as within, or a part of, a partic-\nular network.1 For example, when conducting a network analysis of a corporate\ndepartment, who should be regarded as a member? Only permanent employ-\nees, or do temporary workers also count? What about suppliers or customers?\nTypically, the boundary of a network is determined using either a realist or a\nnominalist approach. In the realist approach,2 researchers define the network\nbased on the views of network members (i.e. the network consists of those\nindividuals who are consensually agreed upon by most other members). In the\nnominalist approach, the network contains those nodes that fit a set of criteria\nspecified by the researcher (e.g. all those who worked in Department A more\nthan 20 h/wk). These two strategies have obvious advantages and disadvantages\nbut also inadvertently drive the analysis toward a particular level of analysis. In\nthat the realist approach relies on the views of network members, it increases\nthe relevance of their individual beliefs and ideas, pushing the analysis as a\nwhole toward the micro-level. Likewise, by emphasizing analyst-set factors, the\nnominalist approach tends to favor a more meso- or macro-level perspective. It\n1 There is a parallel problem in deciding which types of edges (e.g. friendship, material exchange,\nauthority) should be measured. This issue is not usually viewed as quite as significant, however,\nbecause node-based sampling is dominant in network research.\n2 Readers from political science should be especially cautious as the term, as used here, differs\nfrom how it is often used in that discipline. However, the difficulties imposed by the\ncross-disciplinary proliferation of terminology are beyond the domain of this chapter.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Thus, decisions that are often not viewed\nin terms of level of analysis nonetheless partially decide it. By extension, these\nanalytic decisions that shape or constrain the level of analysis may play an out-\nsized role in determining the conclusions that will be drawn from the research,\nwithout the researcher necessarily being aware of it.\nThe result of this confusion is that earlier choices of what is to be studied\nare often partially made by logically subsequent choices of how to study it. For\nexample, a significant body of research shows that individual perceptions of\nnetworks do not match actual contact patterns in a straightforward manner.\nIndeed, the disconnect between who individuals claim to have interacted with\nin a given period of time and who they can be observed to interact with over\nthe same period is so large that researchers have questioned whether humans\ncan be said to recall their interactions at all (e.g. Bernard and Killworth 1977;\nBernard et al. 1979/1980). Reassuringly, subsequent work has shown that while\nhumans are often poor at remembering specific interactions, they are quite\ngood at remembering typical interactions and at identifying subgroups and\nsubgroup members (e.g. Freeman and Romney 1987; Freeman et al. 1987; Free-\nman 1992). Yet, consider this finding in light of the boundary specification\nproblem \u2013 a network defined by the perceptions of its members will necessar-\nily be skewed toward their perceptions of typical patterns of contact and away\nfrom specific and concrete interactions. As a result, this simple decision of how\nto draw a boundary around a network ultimately determines not only which\nnodes are included but the meaningfulness of the resulting network. As such,\nit is necessary to make deliberate decisions about the level of analysis before\nrelated analytic decisions are made. Obviously, decisions can be revisited and\naltered later in the research process, but choices should be made deliberately by\nresearchers and should be made early given the reflexivity of human research\nsubjects. Likely, the failure to proceed in such a manner derives partly from the\ndifficulty involved in identifying the proper level of analysis, an issue to which\nI now turn.\nIncompleteness of Levels of Analysis\nThe difficulty with the traditional conception of levels of analysis is that in many\ninstances it is quite simply insufficient to describe the actual level of inquiry.\nMoreover, this insufficiency makes effective modeling exceptionally difficult.\nThis can be seen especially clearly in two papers deriving from the structuralist\ntradition in sociology (e.g. Blau 1977; Mayhew 1980, 1981), which emphasizes\nmaximal parsimony and minimal attention to the beliefs and ideas of individ-\nuals. The first (Mayhew and Levinger 1976a) attempts to explain the level ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The possible number of\nundirected relations, LMax , increases as n(n \u2212 1)/2 where n is group size; as a\nresult linear increases in group size generate greater than linear increases in\nthe potential number of relations. Since individuals have limited resources to\ndevote to interaction (e.g. time), large systems must include large numbers of\npotential relations that are either null (i.e. totally unused) or contain close to\nzero investments of time and energy. Consequently, if residents of small towns\nseem friendlier than those of large cities, it is not necessarily a cultural distinc-\ntion, but rather is likely a direct mathematical result of the interaction between\nsystem size and limited individual resources.3\nThe second paper (Mayhew and Levinger 1976b) attempts to explain the\nrobust tendency toward oligarchic forms of government using human bio-\nlogical limitations. The authors argue that decisions must be made during, or\nfollowing, an interaction sequence (e.g. series of speaking or influence events).\nHowever, while increases to the size of a group require longer interaction\nsequences in order for each member to have a say, human working memory\nhas a more or less fixed capacity at approximately seven elements (Miller 1956;\nBaddeley 1986). This limitation means that longer sequences cannot be held\nin memory and thus decisions must be made based on smaller sequences\ninvolving interaction between a subset of group members. Moreover, since\nthis limitation does not scale with system size, larger groups must be governed\nby smaller, more oligarchic subgroups.\nThe most obvious point that can be drawn from these two papers is that nei-\nther of them works strictly at a single level of analysis. The first paper uses a\nmacro-level feature of a system, its size, partly in order to predict behavior at\nthe micro-level, the richness of interaction. Likewise, the second paper uses\nindividual-level limitations, in the form of human memory constraints, in an\neffort to explain a macro-level outcome, the centralization of power in large\ngroups. In both cases these efforts are imperfect; the size of the system requires\nthat many interactions become less rich, but says nothing about which interac-\ntions will suffer, while memory limits provide little traction in estimating how\nlarge an oligarchy will be or how it will be structured.\nA second issue is that both explanations are fundamentally compromised\nby an attempt to bridge between levels without paying sufficient attention\nto processes occurring at either. While it is true that increases in system\nsize must produce a decrease in interaction richness overall, the interactions\nthat are preserved will not be randomly distributed. Instead, interactions are\nguided by homophily (Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954; McPherson et al. 2001),\nor the tendency for individuals to associate with similar others (e.g. \u201cBirds of\n3 Improvements in technology can make interaction more efficient, partially counteracting this\ntendency, but they also tend to increase the practical size of the system (e.g. cell phones make it\nless costly to interact but also dramatically increase the number of people who can be interacted\nwith). As such, efficiency gains tend to be overwhelmed by system size increases.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While\nintergroup interaction rates are partly governed by population proportions\n(Blau 1977), homophily tendencies are typically measured as departures from\nthis baseline rate (Marsden 1987, 1988), and homophily varies by sex (Bras-\nhears 2008a) as well as over time (Smith et al. 2014; Brashears 2015). Doubtless\nforces beyond homophily would also play a role, but the broader point should\nbe clear. System size ultimately provides very little insight into how decreases\nin interaction richness will be expressed and provides little predictive power\nfor the inevitable fragmentation of the social system or quality of life therein.\nMoreover, not all characteristics on which individuals can be homophilous are\nsocially meaningful, or salient, and which characteristics confer meaningful\nstatus is itself the outcome of a social process (Ridgeway 1991; Ridgeway\nand Balkwell 1997), leading to cross-cultural variation (Brashears 2008b). As\na result, the macro-level interaction density is fundamentally impacted by\nmicro-level conceptions of what is, or is not, relevant in particular circum-\nstances. Similarly, while it is true that working memory is a limited resource,\nhumans exhibit numerous strategies for circumventing these limitations (e.g.\ncompression heuristics that allow more relations to be accommodated in the\nsame memory space; Brashears 2013; Brashears and Brashears Forthcoming).\nBy failing to take account of these strategies, the underlying connection\nbetween working memory and oligarchy is weakened to the point of irrele-\nvance. Put another way, the limits to working memory are considerably more\nflexible than Mayhew and Levinger (1976b) realize and, as a result, allow quite\na range of solutions to the problem of oligarchy. Additionally, working memory\nis paired with long-term memory as well as various artificial memory aids (e.g.\nwritten language), allowing decisions to be made using a wider range of views\nby trading off against the capabilities of each system. By sprawling awkwardly\nacross levels of analysis, these papers are able to make useful statements in a\nbroad sense (e.g. small towns do not seem more friendly than cities because\nthe inhabitants are qualitatively different) but do so imprecisely, hampering\nefforts to construct models or empirical tests.\nThe third, and most significant, issue is that within and across levels, the\nnature of the predictions made is highly variable. System size influences the\ndensity of interaction in a deterministic way (more people necessarily leads to\nlower interaction density), but the allocation of those interactions is stochas-\ntic. Indeed, with the intervention of homophily, individuals within the system\nmay fail to notice that overall interaction density is decreasing because their\nlocal density remains essentially unchanged (i.e. the system becomes more clus-\ntered). Similarly, while cognitive limitations restrict the scope of interaction\nthat social groups can productively track, this argument is at best stochas-\ntic, in that many approaches to circumventing these limits are available and\ncan be linked to the emergence of a particular oligarchy only through a vastlyDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

As a result, it is unclear what level of evidence would\nbe necessary to support or falsify the models\u2019 predictions and what time scale\nis needed for model outcomes to manifest. For example, is a precise mathe-\nmatical agreement between system size and density of interaction required or\nonly approximate? Without a more precise definition of what is being stud-\nied, accurately specifying the necessary outcomes becomes difficult verging on\nimpossible.\nWhat becomes clear in the above is that the level of analysis, as typically\nconceived, only partly describes the phenomenon to be studied. Because this\ndescription is only partial, it is more likely that the analysis will yield vague,\ndifficult-to-model predictions, at worst making hypothesis testing a matter of\nrhetoric rather than evidence. This is not to say that the above papers are entirely\nirrelevant, but rather only that their impact is blunted and their utility for con-\nstructing predictive models is reduced. To produce the best research, it is nec-\nessary to think deliberately about the proper level of analysis. Moreover, it is\nnecessary to employ a conception of level of analysis that accounts not only\nfor the scale of the phenomenon, as the level of analysis is usually thought to\nspecify, but also for its constancy, a concept to which I now turn.\nConstancy as the Missing Piece\nUseful empirical analysis and modeling requires not just an understanding of\nthe level of scale that characterizes the phenomenon, but the tendency of the\nphenomenon to unfold in consistent, easily predictable ways. I refer to this as\nconstancy in an effort to capture the variation in whether the underlying con-\nnection between inputs and outputs, or causes and effects, is reliable. While\nconstancy is most safely viewed as a somewhat smoothly varying property, we\ncan conceptualize three ideal types to capture how variations in constancy mat-\nter for modeling and analysis.\nAt the highest level of constancy, the phenomenon is deterministic. In this\ncase, a given input will invariably yield a specific output, and thus the phe-\nnomenon behaves in a manner consistent with classical conceptions of physical\nlaw. Much as Newton\u2019s laws of motion deterministically explain many mechan-\nical systems,4 a phenomenon exhibiting maximal constancy will yield identi-\ncal outcomes given identical inputs. The above theory linking system size to\ninteraction (Mayhew and Levinger 1976a) is situated at this level of constancy,\narguing that system size will, by itself, always yield consistent decreases in inter-\naction density. For obvious reasons, many scientists, including social scientists,\n4 It goes without saying that Newton\u2019s laws are only approximations that have been supplanted\nby newer conceptions (e.g. relativity), but they remain valid at the scales and energies humans\ntypically operate at and thus remain a useful exemplar.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The collective inability\nto derive such high constancy rules has generally been blamed on the large\nnumber of factors at work in determining social outcomes. Yet, whether this\naccount is correct or not, the lack of deterministic theory has led social science\nto focus on probabilistic models instead. 5\nAt intermediate levels of constancy, the phenomenon can be described\nas stochastic. In this case, inputs are linked to outputs via a fundamentally\nprobability-based mechanism that does not guarantee the same effect for equal\nsets of causes. Yet, while the precise outcome at any given time is unknown,\nthe likelihood of discrete outcomes is known, and the distribution thereof\nis essentially stationary. For example, when rolling a pair of six-sided dice,\none is ignorant of the specific combination of values that will appear but can\ncharacterize accurately the likelihood of particular sums.6 Social phenomena\nat this level of constancy behave like any other probability distribution in which\nthe general nature of the outcome can be characterized with high accuracy.\nMuch of modern social science has become rooted at this level of constancy,\neschewing the possibility of deterministic laws in favor of a fundamentally\nstochastic view of social organization. For example, Lizardo (2006) used\nlog-linear models (i.e. more advanced forms of chi-squared tests for predicting\nallocation of observations to cells in a cross-classification table) and instru-\nmental variables regression to establish that cultural consumption patterns\nshape the development of network ties. In short, widely accessible forms of\nculture provide a foundation for association with many others and so tend to\nsupport the formation of superficial relationships, while narrowly available\nculture tends to support deeper, more intimate connections. These causal\nconnections are meaningful, and theoretically important, but are entirely\nstochastic; the presence of common culture makes relationships more likely,\nbut does not guarantee them. Access to common culture will increase the\nnumber of relationships possessed, but to a variable extent. Moreover, there\nis no theoretical reason to think that this stochasticity is due to imprecision\nin measurement; even if association would be facilitated by common culture,\nthe actual formation of a tie should always be partly a matter of chance. Thus,\nfor example, you may find yourself chatting about a recent television program\nwith someone you meet on the subway, but this does not inevitably produce a\nnew durable relationship.\n5 Some argue that social scientists have given up on a grand theory entirely, preferring to focus\non smaller domain-specific theories (Swedberg 2017).\n6 Of course, the specific outcome might be predictable given sufficiently precise measurements\nof a host of variables (e.g. weight distributions in the dice, initial orientation, initial vector, exact\nstate of the air, etc.), but even if it were possible to measure all factors sufficiently accurately, in\npractice it is unlikely to be practical or useful to do so. Thus, a specifically stochastic model is\nuseful and practical.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Complex systems \u201c\u2026consist of situated, adaptive, diverse individuals\nwhose interactions produce higher-order structures (self-organization) and\nfunctionalities (emergence)\u201d (Page 2015, p. 22). Such systems include a variety\nof entities engaged in interdependent interaction, and the constituent entities\nare capable of learning and adaptation. As a result, a single stationary proba-\nbility distribution is insufficient to link causes to effects. While some attention\nhas been devoted to the possibility that many social systems are fundamentally\ncomplex (e.g. Ceteno et al. 2015), most social science research remains wedded\nto the notion that causes combine in some broadly linear fashion to yield\nstochastic effects (but see also Davis 2011; Ragin 2014). Exceptions to this\nrule, however, demonstrate its promise. For example, Centola and Macy\n(2007) used a simulation model to show that for social contagions (e.g. new\nbehaviors or technologies that spread via social networks) that are complex\nand require multiple contacts to diffuse (e.g. the benefits of adoption rise as\nmore others have already adopted), long-range bridging ties do not facilitate\nrapid spread. Instead, redundant, densely tied network regions are the most\ncritical drivers of adoption. For example, accepting a new medical claim (e.g.\nthat vaccines cause autism) promulgated on social media may be more likely\nwhen many others to whom one is connected espouse this claim in quick\nsuccession. Thus, this belief will spread more rapidly in denser portions of\nthe network. But critically, later work (Barash et al. 2012) shows that this is\nonly the case early in a diffusion process and that long-range bridging ties\n(i.e. network connections that link otherwise disconnected clusters together)\nplay a more significant role in diffusing complex contagions later on. Thus,\nthe relevance of specific types of ties is not well described by a stationary\nprobability distribution and depends instead on how much progress the\ncontagion has already made. Complex contagions initially benefit from dense\nnetwork regions but not from long-range connections while later come to\nbenefit from bridges as well. Similarly, Shi et al. (2017) used an agent-based\nmodel to study how organization-level pressure for members to devote\ntime to an organization and to limit their social ties to other organization\nmembers impacted organizational growth and longevity. The model addi-\ntionally explored how these factors changed in their effects depending on the\ndegree of competition an organization experienced from other organizations,\nas well as the strategies adopted by those competitors. Their results show\nthat positive growth is attainable with the right strategy combinations, that\neffective combinations differ based on competition, and that the range of\nsuch effective combinations shifts dramatically based on competitor strategy.\nIndeed, the simplest summary of the ideal competitive strategy is \u201cbe slightly\nless demanding than one\u2019s competition,\u201d and so the ideal approach cannot\nbe identified at all without knowing something of the other entities and\ntheir natures.

This position is understandable, but fundamen-\ntally incorrect. Put simply, the goal of most sciences is not, strictly speaking,\nto describe and assess things, but rather to describe and understand processes.\nSince any process is a chain of inputs and outputs, or of causes and effects,\nbinding entities in interaction, then the constancy with which those inputs and\noutputs are connected fundamentally determines the nature of the thing under\nstudy. In other words, the scale of a process is clearly relevant to the level of\nanalysis, but since the goal of analysis is to link causes to effects, so too is the\nconstancy of those processes. Moreover, it is clear that the degree of constancy\nto a phenomenon is not simply a function of the quality of our explanatory\nmodels. While Newtonian mechanics operates in a satisfactorily deterministic\nway within its domain of applicability, quantum mechanics appears to be fun-\ndamentally stochastic. Likewise, while the gas laws are pleasingly deterministic,\nthey are built on a foundation of stochastic behavior at the particle level and are\na factor in shaping global weather, which is generally viewed as a complex sys-\ntem.7 While analyses can approach a phenomenon as though it were stochas-\ntic when it really is not, producing what may be a useful approximation, pro-\ncesses themselves possess some underlying degree of constancy, and the most\naccurate and useful models will be rooted in this degree. As such, the almost\nreflexive tendency of most social science to adopt a stochastic orientation to\nall problems is a clear shortcoming. Likewise, social scientists often default to a\nmultiple regression-based framework (see McPherson 2004), thereby assuming\nlinearity, certain underlying distributions to the data, and a set of static pro-\ncesses. When all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail, and\nwhen all you have is regression, everything will start to look like a stochastic\nlinear process. Such problems become worse with overly strict interpretations\nof Occam\u2019s razor or models of human behavior that are excessively rigid (e.g.\nrational actor assumptions).\nConstancy is related to, but distinct from, the concept of predictability and\nshould not be confused with it. In short, two systems may both be predictable,\n7 Astute readers may note that in contrast to the earlier definition, the weather system does not\ncontain entities capable of adaptation or learning. This is reasonable, but only partly true: the\nbehavior of physical systems can exhibit sudden nonlinear responses (e.g. the clathrate gun), and\nthe presence of living organisms has a powerful aggregate effect (e.g. the oxygen catastrophe).\nThus, even if learning is an incorrect term, the system still exhibits behavior that is a reasonable\nfacsimile.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While a\ntotally unpredictable outcome by definition has a minimal level of constancy\n(i.e. causes and effects are related to each other with zero consistency), pro-\ncesses across a wide range of constancy levels can all be viewed as predictable.\nLikewise, constancy is also distinct from the richness or complexity of the\npredictors (e.g. causes) used to infer an outcome (e.g. effect); few or many\nvariables may be necessary in order to model a process that is fundamentally\ndeterministic, stochastic, or complex. In this sense, constancy is similar in\nlogic to the Big O notation used in computer science to express the impact\nof increasing input size on run time or space requirements for program\nexecution. Much as larger inputs can be connected to run time in a sublinear,\nlinear, or superlinear fashion, more and less complex sets of causes can be\nconnected to effects in a deterministic, stochastic, or complex manner. In all\ncases, there is a connection between input size and run time, but the nature\nof this connection can vary in characteristic ways. Likewise, a process may\nhave a large and complicated phase diagram while nonetheless remaining\nfundamentally deterministic, and we should be cautious not to confuse\nmodeling complexity with process constancy.\nConstancy should be understood as distinct from the scale of a phenomenon,\nwhich usually dominates our thinking in regard to levels of analysis. Returning\nto an earlier example, physical processes occurring at a very small (quantum)\nscale appear to be fundamentally stochastic, but likewise the sum obtained\nfrom a throw of two dice is also stochastic. Despite the extreme scale differ-\nences, the constancy is equivalent. Likewise, the overall behavior of national\neconomies may be deterministic based on several factors (that may themselves\nbe difficult to predict or control), but the success or failure of individual cor-\nporations under these conditions may be stochastic, while the fate of economic\nsectors may be complex. At any given scale processes can exhibit deterministic,\nstochastic, or complex levels of constancy, and failure to take account of these\ndifferences can compromise the resulting models.\nPutting It Together\nUltimately, levels of analysis are most valuable when understood in terms of\nboth scale and constancy. Micro processes can be essentially deterministic,\nstochastic, or complex. For example, work using power dependence theory has\nshown that particular structures of exchange relations (e.g. economic trans-\nactions, choices among prospective dating partners) reliably produce specific\ndegrees of advantage regardless of the intent of the actors (e.g. Emerson 1962).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Thus, individual exchange advantage is best\nmodeled at the micro-deterministic level. At the other end of the micro spec-\ntrum, Simpson et al. (2014) show that the cooperation and defection behavior\nof individuals, even given stable individual preferences, depends on the rela-\ntionship they maintain with their exchange partner (e.g. friends vs. strangers).\nMoreover, this appears to be the case in both experimental and natural settings,\nindicating that realized behavior is determined by an interaction between con-\nsistent individual preferences and particular prior sequences of outcomes that\ngave rise to the current relationship. This work therefore operates primarily at\nthe micro-complex level of analysis.\nAlternatively, while Shi et al.\u2019s (2017) model includes a stochastic component\nto individual agent behavior, it is built from the ground up as a complex sys-\ntem. The order of actions profoundly influences the future development of the\nsystem, and the model connects organization-level and individual-level behav-\nior in a reciprocal fashion. Similarly, Brashears and Gladstone (2016) show that\nthe accuracy of information diffusion depends on both the length of diffusion\nchains and the success or failure of individual efforts to repair errors in the con-\ntagion. Earlier, unpredictable failures in repairs produce dramatic changes in\nthe success of future diffusion. These papers both operate at the meso-complex\nlevel of analysis.\nWork by McPherson (1983) and Mark (1998) shows how organizations\nand musical styles compete for members much as biological organisms\ncompete for food. Organizations require many resources to survive, but the\none resource that they indisputably require is the time and attention of human\nmembers. Since individual time is limited, there exists a finite time budget that\norganizations rely on for their survival. Organizations that compete for the\nsame types of individuals are competing over the same limited pool of time\nmuch as organisms sharing a biological niche compete for food and shelter\nresources. The same logic applies to cultural elements, such as musical styles\n(e.g. harpsichord vs. country music) and languages (e.g. Latin vs. English), such\nthat an element that claims no time from living humans ceases to exist as a\nliving entity. This logic allows recruitment into groups, familiarity with cultural\nartifacts, and even the future demographic makeup of a group (McPherson\nand Ranger-Moore 1991) to be determined by intergroup or inter-style com-\npetition. Moreover, these predictions are heavily deterministic based on the\ndegree of competition for needed resources. This tradition therefore operates\nlargely at the meso-deterministic level.\nUltimately, a wide range of combinations of scale and constancy are possi-\nble and have been explored to some degree in the existing literature. These are\nillustrated in Table 5.1 with examples drawn from the discussion above.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

(2014)\nImplications for Modeling\nOne of the critical advantages to be had from a revised conception of levels of\nanalysis is improvements in modeling. However, making such improvements\nrequires that researchers pay careful attention to a number of issues stemming\ndirectly from the level of analysis.\nConcretely, this expanded concept of levels of analysis will require changes\nin the selection of independent and dependent variables, as well as greater\nattention to the time scale of the phenomenon under study. First, selection\nof independent and dependent variables must ensure that they are matched\nnot only in terms of the scale of the unit of analysis but also that the pro-\nposed linkage between them is at a homogeneous level of constancy. An inde-\npendent variable-to-dependent variable connection that requires many transi-\ntions between deterministic, stochastic, and complex levels of constancy will\nbe difficult to substantiate and model in a useful way. Likewise, unit homo-\ngeneity will become more important in analyses as increasing heterogeneity\nalso implies variation in constancy. This will inevitably drive social scientific\ntheorization toward a focus on smaller mechanisms and will discourage mod-\nelers from excessively general efforts, but encourage the development of a more\nmechanism-focused approach to understanding social life.\nSecond, social scientists often devote relatively little attention to how long\na process requires to play out, not least as a result of data limitations, or rely\non simulation models that are inherently difficult to connect to clock time. Yet,\nattention to constancy will require a greater awareness of how long a mech-\nanism should require to operate, and processes that occur on very different\ntime scales may not belong to the same level of constancy.

While\nthis new approach encourages defining mechanisms in smaller terms using\nboth scale and constancy, it should result in a modular set of models. Each\nsmall model, capturing the behavior of a mechanism operating at a particu-\nlar scale and constancy, can more easily be linked together to create larger,\nmore comprehensive systems. Moreover, the increased focus on the tempo-\nral dimension to mechanisms will make these connections more organic. The\nconnection of micro events directly to macro outcomes in research will be\nsomewhat de-emphasized, leading to greater attention to intermediate-level\nlinkages that help smaller processes aggregate into larger outcomes. Ideally, we\nwill ultimately see a library of mechanisms that are more naturally compatible\nwith each other for the construction of full-scale multi-level models.\nThe increasing availability of automatically logged and time-stamped interac-\ntion data (e.g. email, social media interaction, etc.) offers new opportunities to\nbring time and constancy into focus. The large data sets available from har-\nvesting social media allow issues of temporal ordering to be clarified, while\nthe larger data sizes make it more straightforward to distinguish among con-\nstancy levels. While not without risks (Lazer et al. 2014), the rise of big data is\npromising.\nPreviously, modeling has typically chosen a level of analysis and then viewed\napproach (e.g. formal deterministic vs. agent-based simulation) as a method-\nological issue of lesser importance. However, the key insight that I wish to empha-\nsize is that both of these elements are integral to defining the phenomenon that is\nto be modeled. If the phenomenon acts as a stochastic system, then a stochastic\napproach should be used. In contrast, if it is essentially deterministic, then it\nshould be modeled as such. The goal is to fit the modeling strategy to the com-\nprehensive level of the phenomenon to be studied, consisting of both scale and\nconstancy. This is especially important given that the same social system may\nbehave in both deterministic and complex ways, depending on time or other\nfactors. It will be necessary to understand how these levels interface in order to\nproduce accurate predictive models.\nAdopting this approach will require active participation from both social\nscientists and modelers. Social scientists have the theoretical and substantive\nknowledge necessary to understand a phenomenon but often are ill equipped\nto construct formal or computational models. Modelers possess this expertise\nbut lack an understanding of the phenomenon that they hope to model. Thus,\nsuccessful efforts will be rooted in collaboration, but it cannot be collaboration\nas usual. For social scientists, more attention will need to be directed to the\nexpected behavior of the process under study. This will be difficult in some\ncases as many social science disciplines currently carve up their field of interestDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

How-\never, forcing attention to these issues should facilitate improved integration\nacross subareas, as disparate substantive areas often share common processes\nof interest (e.g. recruitment is of interest to researchers studying religion,\nformal organizations, and social movements, among others). Moreover, many\ntheories are at least somewhat level agnostic (e.g. ecological theory) or have\ndistinct predictions and proposed mechanisms operating at particular levels.\nThus it will often be possible to adopt this more refined conception of levels\nof analysis without abandoning the existing corpus of theory or substantive\nknowledge.\nFor modelers, this shift will require a degree of humility. Rather than mod-\neling a social process based on the skills the modeler already has (e.g. \u201cI am an\nagent-based modeler\u201d), it will be necessary to think seriously about the concor-\ndance between modeling method and underlying process. This will require con-\nsiderable knowledge of the theory and substantive findings present in a given\narea because scale, which is relatively easy to identify, provides little guidance\nas to constancy. Prior assumptions that scale is closely linked to constancy col-\nlapse under only light scrutiny and should not be relied upon. Modelers should\nbe especially cautious when exploring social topics because the identification\nof something as being, or not being, a problem to be solved is itself often the\noutcome of a social process. For example, technical limitations and bureau-\ncratic inertia led to a systematic failure to properly account for the impact of\nmass fire following a nuclear strike, leading to significant underestimates of the\ndamage likely to result from an exchange of strategic nuclear weapons (Eden\n2004). Similarly, an incremental process of accommodation led NASA engi-\nneers and managers to ignore growing signs of aberrant behavior, ultimately\nresulting in the loss of the space shuttle Challenger (Vaughan 1996). In both of\nthese examples, the conception of the problem was, itself, the driver of signifi-\ncant failures and oversights. Rapidly identifying a system to be modeled without\ninput from social science experts runs a high risk of baking a large number of\nbiases and problematic assumptions in from the start.\nThe needed changes for both social scientists and modelers will be more\neasily achieved if they work together in active collaboration throughout the\nresearch process. Critically, this means that teams of modelers who add a\nsocial scientist as, essentially, window dressing or teams of social scientists\nwho add a modeler as a mere programmer are to be avoided. Instead, relatively\nequal teams will be needed that feature frank discussions between both\ntypes of researchers. Teams will also need to avoid past tendencies to use\ncollaborations to add depth to specific areas of a study rather than to build\nconnections between different areas (Leahey 2016). Ideally, these efforts will\nlead over time to an increase in the role of modeling within social science, as\nwell as a group of modelers who have greater familiarity with social science.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Typical concepts of levels of analy-\nsis are limited to questions of scale and therefore ignore the degree of constancy\nexhibited by the processes of interest. As a result, it is often highly uncertain\nwhat is actually being studied. This uncertainly hinders efforts to construct\naccurate models and therefore damages our chances of accumulating useful\ngeneral models of social behavior. Moreover, decisions impacting the level of\nanalysis are often inadvertently made by certain analytic decisions, potentially\ncompromising the ability of research to speak to its intended topics.\nMoving past these challenges will require several changes. Social scientists\nand modelers must collaborate in a genuine two-way manner. While it is hypo-\nthetically attractive to simply plug a social scientist or modeler into a team to\nincrease its attractiveness to funders, this makes poor use of resources and con-\ntributes nothing to improving the state of the art. Both types of researchers can\nadd to the process if given genuine opportunities. Likewise, we must give up the\nnotion that improvements in social science will necessarily lead to determinis-\ntic laws of social behavior. Some determinism is surely present, but many social\nsystems are complex and therefore inherently defy such efforts. If the underly-\ning phenomenon is complex, then we must theorize it, and model it, as such,\nand make use of the resulting predictions in a way that is consistent with the\ncontingent and uncertain nature of complex systems.\nThe challenges are obvious, but the severity of existential challenges facing\nour society, as well as the fundamentally social nature of their solutions, makes\nthe benefits clear. Only by more accurately grasping the nature of the processes\nwe hope to understand can we learn to model and control them.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper was partially supported by grants from the Defense Threat\nReduction Agency (HDTRA-1-10-1-0043) and the Army Research Institute\n(W911NF-16-1-0543).

In common usage, the word story implies a rather\nlimited episode, for instance, grandpa telling a story about his childhood or\nthat big battle in World War II. But in fact, most stories depend on larger nar-\nratives for meaning and context. Stories of the American Revolution take on\ntheir meaning of democratic empowerment only in the context of stories about\nBritish imperial rule in the pre-revolution colonies. Contemporary stories like\nthose surrounding the US Tea Party movement are meaningful, in part because\nof the context of stories of the American Revolution. Understanding the nar-\nrative of Al-Qaeda requires knowledge of stories about the Soviet invasion of\nAfghanistan, as well as the US response to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990\nand subsequent stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia (Wright 2006).

Islamist extremists\u2019 heavy use of narrative\nto influence contested populations to support their cause has led researchers\nto consider the role of narrative in countering Islamist ideologies (Quiggin\n2009; Halverson et al. 2011), in sharpening the public messaging of the United\nStates in its military information operations and public diplomacy efforts\n(Sloggett and Sloggett 2009; Paruchabutr 2012), in illuminating complex\ninformation environments where rumors and disinformation proliferate\n(Bernardi et al. 2012), and in explaining extremism in general (Corman 2016).\nImportant as these efforts may be, they miss a potentially more important\naspect of narrative \u2013 that it is a logic of action that may be useful for orga-\nnizing or predicting the behavior of adversaries and the course of events\nin conflict and competition situations (whether in security, business, or\nother arenas).\nFor example, one reason DOD efforts to win the battle of the narrative have\nyielded limited results is the DOD\u2019s reliance on a definition of narrative rooted\nin the spoken or written word. Joint Publication 3-0 Joint Operations defines\nnarrative as \u201ca short story used to underpin operations and to provide greater\nunderstanding and context to an operation or situation\u201d (US Department\nof Defense 2017, p. III-18). This outdated definition equates narrative with\nreactive efforts of public affairs officers when a mission or strike has gone awry\nor the five-paragraph description of a commander\u2019s operational design found\nelsewhere in US DOD joint doctrine (e.g. US Department of Defense 2011,\np. IV-44).\nContemporary conceptualizations treat narrative as a cognitive process of\ncomprehension, a consensus that spans the fields of psychology (Mandler 1984;\nBruner 1991), sociology (Cortazzi 2001), communication (Fisher 1984), litera-\nture (Jahn 1997; Herman 2003), and media studies (Branigan 1992; Ryan 2006).\nWhat unites these fields\u2019 approaches to narrative is a movement away from\nan antiquated and strictly textual (whether oral, graphical, or written) defini-\ntion of narrative, and a recognition that the phenomenon of narrative is better\nand more usefully understood, as Branigan describes, \u201cas a distinctive strategy\nfor organizing data about the world, for making sense and significance\u201d (1992,\np. 18). Recognizing that narrative is more than a set of spoken or written words\n(or images), but rather is also a means of organizing information \u2013 notably\nevents, actors, and desires, and an underlying logic of action \u2013 unlocks the\npower of narrative as a means to understand beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.\nThis more nuanced and powerful definition of narrative may be unusual or\nunsettling to those more familiar with the dictionary definition provided by US\nDOD doctrine as noted above. However, leveraging the insights and advances\nof the humanities and social sciences over the past 30 years offers opportunitiesDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Data elements\n(what we describe below as locations, events, actions, and participants (LEAP)\nare perceived and then slotted into functional roles, which support an eval-\nuation of whether the combination makes sense. Whether the combination\nmakes sense depends on the plausibility of the arrangement of data elements\nand the congruency with past comprehension episodes. In other words, narra-\ntives embody a unique form of rationality composed of coherence and fidelity\n(Fisher 1984) that helps decide what should happen next in a constellation of\nnarrative elements. It is distinct from the instrumental rationality typically used\nto explain behavior in conflict situations (Eriksson 2011; Wittek et al. 2013).\nNissen (2013) uses the idea of a comprehension process with its own form of\nrationality to argue for narrative as a basis for making command intent clear in\nmilitary operations.\nUnfortunately, narrative as it is traditionally applied is also primarily descrip-\ntive in nature and does not support its use in discovery and forecasting. For\nexample, the narrative arc (Abbott 2001; Halverson et al. 2011) is a heuristic\nused to organize the elements and flow of a story. It specifies a conflict (or\nother deficiency) that creates desire, motivating characters in the story. The\ndesire gives rise to a set of LEAP factors that are connected over time and lead\nto a resolution of the desire. In fictional or historical stories, the resolution is\nknown, and the arc furnishes a narrative-rational explanation of how the char-\nacters arrived at the resolution. In most cases this is how the arc is applied, as\nan analytical framework for post facto explanation of a known resolution.\nThough the narrative arc is a useful tool for abstract analysis of simple sto-\nries, it oversimplifies how narrative operates in the real world. First, in most\nreal-world stories \u2013 especially those of interest to the defense community \u2013 the\nresolution lies in the future, is not known, and is multiplex. The problem is not\nexplaining how a resolution came about, but which of many potential resolu-\ntions might come to be. Such an analysis would provide insight into partici-\npant actions/events that would constitute progress toward any such potential\nresolution. Accommodating for the linkage between any potential resolution\nand emotionality, sacred values, and connection to related narrative systems\n(or other criteria) can offer analysts and modelers a path toward assessing the\nattractiveness or potential power of a particular narrative trajectory among the\nrange of plausible trajectories.\nSecond, as we argue above, real-world narratives are part of a system\n(Halverson et al. 2011).

A good example of this in a present-day context is the conflict in\nSyria. The narratives expressing, shaping, and driving the conflict in Syria\noverlap and exert influence on adjacent narratives in complicated ways that\nwould benefit from new tools of thinking, modeling, analysis, and visualization.\nThese narratives are not exclusively the words used to describe events; rather,\nthey are the glue that individuals and communities use to understand the\nconsequences of the events and agents in the world.\nUsing narratives, then, is a kind of cognitive strategy and also a potential\nmechanism for influence. Figure 6.1 offers a simplified schematic of the narra-\ntive landscape of Syria vis-\u00e0-vis the civil war, humanitarian crisis, and linkage\nto terrorism. The columns represent the functional roles of a macro-level nar-\nrative structure (the traditional narrative arc, discussed above), and the arrows\nindicate dependencies between the elements of different narrative trajectories\nrelated to the Syria conflict. For example, the Arab Spring is an event com-\nplicating Assad\u2019s trajectory of maintaining power (first row), and it is also an\nevent representing a threat to the Ummah (conflict, third row). Actions in the\nglobal war on terrorism (GWOT) trajectory, such as air strikes (event, fourth\nrow), enhance the perception of the threat to the Ummah that motivates ISIS\u2019s\nnarrative trajectory (conflict and desire, third row). Meanwhile the projected\nresolution of the ISIS sub-narrative, a caliphate, enhances the terrorism conflict\nthat motivates the GWOT trajectory (conflict, fourth row).

Each conflict instills\ndesires in the actors it motivates, and there may be multiple \u2013 even conflicting \u2013\ndesires. Each desire is connected to a set of LEAP elements in complex ways,\nand LEAP elements may be connected to each other. For example, events\nmay take place in typical locations (e.g. protests in public squares or near\ngovernment buildings), and participants may favor certain kinds of action or\nonly have access to certain locations. Conversely, actions may require a certain\nkind of participant. The LEAP elements are connected to multiple possible\nresolutions, and configurations of them might make one resolution more likely\nthan another. Over time, resolutions may themselves lead to escalation or\nde-escalation of conflicts or creation of new ones.\nA Generative Modeling Framework\nThus, a real-world narrative system can be conceptualized as a time-based\ndirected graph, as shown in Figure 6.2. In such a graph, the vertices may be\nassigned weights. For example, one desire may be stronger than another, or\nsome participant may be more powerful or consequential than another. The\nedges may also have weights indicating probability or strength of connection,\nConflict1\nConflict2\nConflictn\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nDesire 1\nDesire 2\nDesiren\n.\n.\n.\nLocation 1\nLocation2\nLocationn\n.\n.\n.\nEvent1\nEvent2\nEventn\n.\n.\n.\nAction1\nAction2\nActionn\n.\n.\n.\nParticipant1\nParticipant2\nParticipantn\n.\n.\n.\nResolution1\nResolution2\nResolutionn\nFigure 6.2 A notional generative network.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For instance, there may be a higher probability of actionx given desirey.\nOr there may be a higher probability of locationx given participanty or a weaker\nconnection between eventx and resolutiony.1\nApplication to a Simple Narrative\nTo partially illustrate the application of the framework just described, we apply\nit to the simple narrative system of a well-known fairy tale, The Three Little Pigs.\nDoing so capitalizes on advantages of story familiarity and a limited scope and\nhelps us identify some of the challenges involved in applying our framework\nto real-world examples. The text of the story we used comes from Ashliman\u2019s\nFolktexts (1996\u20132017). Of course, real-world conflicts that are not at all fanciful\nhave narrative bases as well (Halverson et al. 2011; Bernardi et al. 2012; Corman\n2016), but a short story with a limited scope makes illustration of the generative\nnarrative concept more tractable.\nWe began by trying to identify the LEAP factors in the story paragraph by\nparagraph, looking for cases where actions connect locations, events, and par-\nticipants. For example, one of the early events in the story is when the first little\npig gets straw from the man with straw to build his house. We coded this as\nindicated in Table 6.1.\nHowever, this reveals one possible problem with the LEAP factors identified\nabove: straw is not an agent and therefore cannot take actions on its own.\nWe decided to add a fourth type of arc factor called things and continued\nidentifying locations, events, actions, participants, and things (LEAPT) factors\n(shown in appendix \u201cLocations, Events, Actions, Participants, and Things\nin the Three Little Pigs\u201d) and their connections in the rest of the story. We\nexpect that things will help contextualize relationships between participants,\nactions, and events when the narrative system is abstracted into a graph, but\nTable 6.1 LEAP coding example.\nParticipant Action Participant\nPig 1 Meet Straw vendor\nPig 1 Obtain Straw\n1 This scheme bears some resemblance to SRI\u2019s SEAS system (Lowrance 2007), but that system\ndiffers from the perspective described here in that it is intended to support reasoning based on\nclassical rationality and relies on hierarchies represented by directed acyclic graphs.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Finlayson, for example, classifies animate\nand non-animate objects as entities that either act or are acted upon within\nthe context of key narrative actions serving plot functions (2011, p. 48). This\napproach works for constrained systems, such as the folktales Finlayson uses\nas his data source. As our approach is applied to a less constrained narrative\nsystem such as a corpus of news articles from a region, the greater fidelity\nafforded by an additional subclass of LEAP(T) element may be necessary to\ndistill narratives out of an unruly corpus.\nIt is this latter big data context that in part also differentiates our approach\nfrom the field of computational interactive narrative, which pursues the related\nchallenge of generating believable narrative experiences responsive to user\ninput in a virtual environment. Like our approach, these emphasize entities\nand events organized in a structure. Some approaches distinguish between\ncharacters and objects (e.g. S\u00e1nchez and Lumbreras 1997; Murray 2005),\nwhile most focus primarily on characters as entities (Mateas and Stern 2002;\nHartmann et al. 2005), owing to their more constrained systems and focus on\nplot actions. The degree to which specific objects aid in correctly categorizing\ndifferent event\u2013participant interactions is an open research question for our\napproach in unconstrained contexts.\nA second issue we encountered in coding the story had to do with locations.\nTypically, words used in the story to describe locations are also used to describe\nthings. For example, the wolf visits the first little pig\u2019s house, then huffs and\npuffs, and blows the house down. The wolf\u2019s actions transform the thing, but\nthe location still exists. Thus, we described the wolf going to the house with\nedges representing both the thing and the location, as shown in Table 6.2.\nA third issue encountered in coding the story had to do with events, specifi-\ncally their scope. Technically, each subject/action/object triple could be consid-\nered as an event. This approach would create one event for each action taken.\nHowever, the conceptual category we recognize and label as an event typically\nencompasses numerous actions \u2013 in other words, a collection of actions that\nmake something worthy of being called an event. For example, a terrorist attack\ninvolves planning, obtaining weapons, traveling to the target, and executing the\nattack. Also included in the terrorist event are the designation of the attack as\na terrorism incident and numerous actions involving victims. If any of these\nTable 6.2 Dual coding of things and locations.\nSubject Action Object\nWolf Visit Straw house (thing)\nWolf Visit Straw house (location)Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, in real-world contexts, especially\ndefense-relevant ones, information is frequently missing. An important ques-\ntion is whether the information in the graph is generative in the sense that we\ncan infer unknown information from known information. To answer this ques-\ntion, we demonstrate that two techniques can be used to infer at least some\nmissing edge weights and missing relationships in the graph in Figure 6.3.\nRegarding the first of these, suppose we knew the basic relationships in\nFigure 6.3, but did not know the edge weights. By the notation of line graphs,\nwe can turn each edge of a narrative system into a node of its line graph, with\nconnections between these being created by nodes in the original graph. Thus,\nthe edge-states inference problem becomes the problem of inferring the node\nstates on this line graph. We created the line graph of Figure 6.3 and computed\ncurrent flow betweenness centrality as a measure of the importance of the\nnodes (which, again, represent the links in the original Figure 6.3 graph). We\nthen used these values to replace the link weights in the original graph. The\nresult is shown in Figure 6.4.\nThe correlation between the original weights (co-occurrence counts) and the\nestimated values from the line graph is r = 0.583 (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.34). On the\none hand, though we regard this as promising performance, it would clearly be\nbetter to have more than 34% accuracy in predicting edge weights in a practi-\ncal context. On the other hand, we can see that many of the same qualitative\nconclusions about the story drawn above would hold true. The most important\nedges still involve pig 3 and the wolf and their actions of visiting/traveling to\nplaces and obtaining things.\nA second kind of missing information in the narrative graph in Figure 6.3\ncould be missing links between the nodes. From graph analysis perspective,\nthis is a classic example of the link prediction problem, where we want to\ninfer the unknown/missing links based on the known/observed links between\nnodes. To accomplish this, we applied random-walk-based methods (Tong\net al. 2006; Zhu 2006). Specifically, we created a one-mode projection of\nthe graph in Figure 6.3, representing the locations, events, participants, and\nthings as connected by actions. For every edge (i, j), we deleted it and then\ncomputed the ranking value R(i, j) using a random walk with restart (RWR)\n(Tong et al. 2006). It summarizes the weighted summation of all the possible\npaths from nodei to nodej, i.e. the more short paths from nodei to nodej, the\nhigher the ranking value R(i, j) is. The nodes with rank 1 for R(*, j) are shown in\nTable 6.4.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For\nexample, due to the existence of an indirect path from pig 3, through wolf,\nto brick house, RWR would infer a strong association between pig 3 and\nwolf, thus suggesting the existence of a possible link between them. We\ncannot infer which verb should connect the elements but that there should\nbe some action-based connection. This includes several connections that are\nkey to the story. For example, pig 3 did something with a brick house, pig 3\ndid something with apples, and the wolf had an action related to the pot of\nwater.

While this demonstrates\nthe potential of the method, in practical contexts, higher performance is desir-\nable. Even with this method, a potential bottleneck for large-scale application\nof this technique lies in computation, as the size of a line graph could be signifi-\ncantly larger than its original graph (i.e. the input generative system). However,\nthe low-rank structure of the line graph, with the help of the source/target\nincident matrices, might be the key to addressing the computational issue, as\nindicated in our prior work (Kang et al. 2011). Possible strategies for improving\nperformance of the method include the heterogeneous information network\nmodel (Sun and Han 2012) and factor graph inference methods (McCallum\net al. 2009).\nOur application of the RWR method to infer missing links shows promise,\nbut at this point can only show that some action should relate two nodes,\nnot which action. Theoretically, application of narrative logic principles could\nfurther narrow the possibilities of what type of relationship exists between\ntwo nodes. Stories that recur within narrative systems often share common\nstructures and thus common node relationships. For example, in the original\nBoston Tea Party story, the revolutionaries protest a distant government\nmaking taxation decrees without representation. In 2010, political activists\nperceived administration efforts to impose taxation mandates related to\nfunding healthcare initiatives as an equivalent governmental decree without\nrepresentation. Thus, the edge connecting 2010 political activists and US\ngovernment would be oppose just as it is in the original Boston Tea Party\nnarrative network.\nOther methods have the potential to improve the performance of this\ntechnique. First, in terms of data modeling, there are different types of nodes\nin generative narrative systems (e.g. conflict, desire, locations, resolutions,\netc.). This suggests that the heterogeneous information network model (Sun\nand Han 2012), which encodes both topological and attribute information\nof nodes and links, might be a better choice than the plain unipartite graph\nrepresentation. Second, in terms of inference algorithms, we note that the\nfundamental assumption behind random-walk-based methods is homophily,\nwhich might oversimplify the complicated relationship of a generative narra-\ntive system. 5 Factor graph inference methods (McCallum et al. 2009) might be\na more effective way to infer node states in the presence of such a heterophily\neffect by introducing a compatibility matrix between different node types,\n5 For example, two opposite desires might originate from the same conflict and/or partially share\nthe same participants and locations.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

There are other missing information problems we have not addressed\nin the example. For example, a node\u2019s state/weight could be missing from\nthe information used to create a graph. Possible methods for addressing this\ninclude graph-based semi-supervised learning (Zhu 2006).\nAt a more macro scale, the abstract model of Figure 6.2 suggests that cer-\ntain conflicts may be more likely than others to lead to a given resolution. For\ninstance, in Syria, is the conflict between the Kurds and the Turks more likely\nto lead to a restoration of Assad\u2019s power than the conflict between the United\nStates and Russia? Such a question poses an interesting theoretical challenge:\nthe conventional answer would take the form of a historical explanatory nar-\nrative (after the conflict resolves). Generating plausible narrative trajectories\nmight illuminate what potential answers are possible when combining the com-\nmunication and narrative theory models discussed above. The cognitive narra-\ntology approach stipulates that narratives are mental processes of data acquisi-\ntion and organization via culturally provided templates. The narrative validity\napproach stipulates criteria for acceptance (coherence and fidelity). These point\nto potential avenues for eliciting potential narrative trajectories from a large\ncorpus of data.\nComputationally, this becomes a problem of predicting the most likely path-\nway in each narrative network. As a starting point for solving this problem,\nthe connection subgraph (Tong and Faloutsos 2006) is a natural way to infer a\nsmall connection subgraph from one or more desired nodes (the source nodes)\nto one or more resolution nodes (the target nodes). The detected connection\nsubgraph contains most important intercorrelated paths from the source\nnode(s) to the destination node(s). Here a potential risk lies in the outlying/\nnoisy querying nodes. If the input query contains one or more irrelevant desire/\nresolution nodes or multiple desire/resolution nodes form multiple indepen-\ndent groups, the standard connection subgraph tools might introduce false\nconnections between the irrelevant desire and resolution. We hypothesize that\nan effective solution to address this issue is graph summarization (Akoglu et al.\n2013): given a set of desire and resolution nodes on a narrative system, the aim\nwould be to simultaneously find (i) the grouping/clustering structure of desire/\nresolution nodes and (ii) the optimal connection/pathway within each group.\nScale Challenges\nThe second research problem is the macro-level scope and scale of the model.\nOn one hand, if we take seriously the idea that narratives are part of a system,\nthen potentially all narratives that could interact with a generative narrative\nmodel are relevant to its operation. For instance, in the Syria example given\nabove, Turkey and its opposition to Kurdish groups is not included. Neither is\nIsrael\u2019s recent attack on the Golan Heights. Are these elements of the Syrian\nnarrative too critical to ignore? On the other hand, as the model scales up, itDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Adding Israel into the example Syria narrative could entail the entire\nal Nakba narrative (Halverson et al. 2011, chapter 12) and others related to it,\nmaking the graph impossibly complicated. The challenge would be to locate a\nsweet spot where it is possible to specify the model at a just large enough scale\nto encompass significant influences on the course of a conflict without making\nit overly complex.\nA second and related problem is scaling of the elements shown in Figure 6.1.\nThe Syria conflict could be framed in terms of the Arab Spring revolution, or\nof Assad\u2019s desire to stay in power, or of various groups vying for control of the\ncountry, or of a proxy war between the United States, Russia, Iran, and the Arab\nstates. Desires for Assad could be defined in sweeping terms like maintaining\nsovereignty and power or in strategic terms like control of a given part of the\ncountry. Locations could be large areas like countries or provinces or very small\nones like cities, towns, and villages. Events can be unitized at different time\nscales, participants could scale from organizations to groups to individuals, and\nso on. The challenge would be defining a tractable way of defining the elements\nat similar and conformable scales.\nSensitivity Challenge\nA final problem is determining the sensitivity of a generative narrative model\nto missing information. The sensitivity of networks to missing information in\ndescriptive applications is well known (Holland and Leinhardt 1973). In a com-\nplex network such as what we are describing, the problem could be worse:\nmissing elements could completely change the conclusion of the model, or it\nmay have less effect owing to the ability of other known elements to compensate\nfor missing ones. The challenge would be to test a prototype model to determine\nthe effect of removing elements on the output of the model.\nConclusion\nFrom an information science and communication perspective, this approach\nhas the potential to create a paradigm shift of narrative analysis, from simple\ndescription to discovery and forecasting. We envision that the proposed\ngenerative narrative network offers a potentially ideal way to model a holis-\ntic/comprehensive picture of narratives (including multiple intercorrelated\nconflicts, temporal dynamics, and the feedback effect of resolution to conflict)\nthat has largely been ignored in the existing models. It would also open the\ndoor to the vast machinery of graph mining tools and algorithms, which would\nin turn allow us to understand/discover, forecast, and even influence narratives\nin a desired way.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Agent-\nbased modeling (ABM) has assumed an increasingly important place in the\nstudy of social systems. Originally, ABMs operated on the basis of component\nagents making decisions about their behavior based on rules, which processed\ninformation about their own states and the states of other agents to which they\nwere connected (Kotseruba et al. 2016). Since the late 1990s, so-called cognitive\nABMs have become increasingly popular because \u201cthe use of cognitive archi-\ntectures leads to a more detailed (and deeper) computational model of social\nphenomena\u201d (Sun 2007, p. 36).\nCognitive ABMs incorporate elements of agency typical of human behavior,\nincluding memories and motivations, which link goals with actions and\nactions with outcomes. In other words, they imbue agents with rationality.\nAdditionally, they imbue agents with decision-making processes influenced\nby reward and punishment, which is also known as reinforcement learning.\nQ-learning, a scheme of reinforcement learning, for example, is used in\nClarion (Sun 2007), and many architectures of cognitive ABMs use some\nform of reinforcement to implement associative learning (Kotseruba et al.\n2016). Advances in deep learning represent a complementary track for cog-\nnitive ABMs, enabling, for example, the learning of temporal and language\nsequences using long short-term memory units (Greff et al. 2017) and the\ngeneration and discrimination of novel patterns using generative adversarial\nnetwork (Goodfellow et al. 2014), all of which enrich cognitive ABMs beyond\nassociative learning. Such techniques have been applied in (as yet imperfect)\ngeneration of narratives from photo streams (Wang et al. 2018).\nExisting cognitive ABMs are based on instrumental rationality (see Lehman\net al. (2006)) for a simple example applied to baseball pitching). But, as we have\nargued, narrative rationality is an alternative and possibly more realistic alter-\nnative, based on motivations (desires) that create collections of interrelated\nLEAPT factors, which themselves lead to outcomes (resolutions). Thus, gen-\nerative narrative networks constitute a potential new avenue for describing the\ncognitive architecture of computational agents.\nFrom an applied perspective, a generative narrative model would offer the\nmeans to explore the potential impact of exogenous influences on a narrative\nlandscape \u2013 a testbed for potential defense response options (whether infor-\nmational such as a psychological operations [PSYOP] series or kinetic such\nas a drone strike) and their effect on prevailing narratives. Often, narratives\nprovide an explanation of why events resulted in a particular conclusion.\nAttention to the key components of the narrative reveals motivations and\nkey causal relationships. But humans understand themselves in terms of\nnarratives (Polkinghorne 1988), and narrative logic shapes our understanding\nof the world (Branigan 1992; Fisher 1984). If we could forecast the narrative\ntrajectory of a given situation, given the principles of narrative fidelity, we\nshould be able to equally forecast the likely outcomes or at least bound the\nrange of options likely available to an actor/agent/adversary.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

As the first Battle of Fallujah\nin March 2004 illustrates, tactical battlefield victories are hollow if dominance\nof the cognitive terrain is not equally achieved.6 The relevance of the paradigm\nproposed here, and research that supports it, is a better understanding of how\nmeaning and perception shape actions and responses over time. Decisions by\nleaders, communities, and populations take place in the context of the con-\nflicts, motivations, and goals that frame the situation \u2013 they are embedded in\nnarrative landscapes.\nThus, a generative narrative analysis capability could enhance not only mili-\ntary intelligence preparations of adversary courses of action but also business\nand marketing strategies, public health outreach campaigns, and innumerable\nother situations. Such generative narrative analysis could also provide insight\ninto how potential US government, business, or nongovernmental organization\nactions might alter a community\u2019s narrative landscape and thus those critical\npublic perceptions and meanings. Along with shaping campaign plans at the\nstrategic level, a generative narrative analysis paradigm would contribute to\ndecision-making at a tactical level.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors thank Alex Yahiya for helpful comments on a draft of this\nmanuscript.\nLocations, Events, Actions, Participants, and Things in\nthe Three Little Pigs\nLocations Events Actions Participants Things\nL1 = straw\nhouse\nE1 = quest\nbegins\nA1 = send away P1 = old sow T1 = straw\nL2 = stick\nhouse\nE2 = house\ncreated\nA2 = seeks P2 = little pig 1 T2 = straw\nhouse\nL3 = brick\nhouse\nE3 = house\ndestroyed\nA3 = obtain P3 = little pig 2 T3 = sticks\n6 Conventional wisdom holds that the US retaliation against insurgent killing of four US\ncontractors temporarily rooted out insurgent elements but turned community allegiance toward\nthe insurgents, forcing subsequent US withdrawal from the city in April and ceding it to insurgent\ncontrol.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These motivational\ndynamics arise from organized motivational systems within the individual\ninteracting with the social and physical environment, as well as with the internal\nenvironment of the individual. A particular focus of our model is on capturing\nindividual differences in motivation and decision-making and the underly-\ning neurobiological mechanisms that are responsible for those individual\ndifferences. The model we discuss is implemented as a neural network model.\nOne benefit of our model is that it provides a framework that allows\nresearchers to create a relatively lightweight set of psychological mecha-\nnisms for an agent that can quickly and efficiently generate a wide range of\nplausible behaviors. At the same time, because the model is firmly grounded\nin a wide array of research and theory, it provides a psychologically and\nneurobiologically plausible account of these mechanisms.\nMuch, if not most, of the work on models of decision-making focuses on\nhow people make single decisions. In contrast, our focus is on the dynamics\nof decision-making as people move through situations and across time as\nthey move through their daily lives. We are interested in how motivation and\ndecisions change over time as a function of changes in the situation and the\nindividual\u2019s internal state, which are influenced by external forces as well as\nthe individual\u2019s own actions.\nMost models of decision-making are variants of subjective expected utility\nmodels, where the individual is treated as having a stable utility function for\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

In contrast, we model decision-making in terms of the dynamics of\nunderlying motivational systems interacting with a changing internal and exter-\nnal environment. Instead of modeling decisions in terms of abstract values, we\nmodel them in terms of the competing influence of multiple concrete motives\nwithin broad motivational systems. Further, our model assumes that the values\nof choices will vary over time and situation as a function of the internal and\nexternal environment. For example, the value of food depends on how hun-\ngry we are, and the value of social contact depends on how lonely we are. Our\ncharacterization of these motivational systems is grounded in what is currently\nknown about the neurobiological bases of the relevant motivational/reward\nprocessing systems.\nOverview\nOur neural network model of motivated decision-making and personality\n(Read et al. 2010, 2017a,b, in press) argues that decisions and behavior in\neveryday life arise from the interactions between structured motivational\nsystems and the motive affordances of situations. By motive affordances we\nmean that a key aspect of the representation of the situations that people\nfind themselves in is a representation of the possibilities that the situation\naffords (or provides) for the pursuit of different motives. For example, a\ncafeteria affords the pursuit of food, whereas a classroom affords the pursuit\nof achievement (although both situations also provide opportunities for social\ninteraction). We argue that situations activate representations of motives that\ncan be pursued in that situation and that different situations have different\ndistributions of affordances (afford the pursuit of different motives). Because\nthe distributions of affordances vary across situations, as situations change,\nan individual\u2019s relevant motives change. In addition, based on learning and\npossible neurobiological differences, individuals may differ in the motive\naffordances of situations. For example, one individual may see a fraternity\nparty as affording social affiliation and mating, whereas another individual\nmay see the same party as affording social rejection or even physical harm.\nMore specifically, we propose that everyday motivated decision-making is\na joint function of the individual\u2019s current motivational state and the motive\naffordances of the situations in which the individual finds herself. Further, the\nindividual\u2019s current motivational state is a joint function of (i) the individual\u2019s\nbaseline or chronic motivations, which typically vary across individuals, (ii) the\ncurrent motivationally relevant bodily or interoceptive states (e.g. information\nregarding current internal states, such a sense of hunger, exhaustion, or loneli-\nness) that provide information as to whether various needs (e.g. for food, water,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nTheoretical Background 147\ncompanionship) are currently met, and (iii) the current motive affordances in\nthe situation. For example, an individual may have a moderately high typical or\nbaseline need for people, may be lonely at the particular time, and may see that\nthe situation offers the opportunity for social contact.\nInteroceptive state, the motive affordances of situations, and the strength of\ncompeting motives all vary over time and situations. Further, the individual\u2019s\nchoices and behaviors can then modify his/her current interoceptive state as\nwell as the current situation.\nAs a result of all these factors, everyday decision-making, the sequence of\nchoices that an individual makes as they move through daily life, is a highly\ndynamic process: situations and bodily states change as a function of the indi-\nvidual\u2019s own actions and the actions of other people and the environment. As\na result, the individual\u2019s motivational state and the situation to which they are\nresponding are in a continual state of flux. Thus, choices and behavior will vary\ndynamically over the course of a day.\nConstraint Satisfaction Processing\nIt is useful to think of this kind of decision-making process as a constraint sat-\nisfaction process that operates to make choices as a joint function of a number\nof different factors, such as the environment, the individual\u2019s current bodily\nstates, chronic and momentary motives, and their previous behaviors. This pro-\ncess would typically be highly nonlinear and dependent on the order of infor-\nmation received, the order of behavior, and the feedback relationships. Such\nconstraint satisfaction processes, such as occur in neural networks, are typi-\ncally only locally optimal. There is no guarantee that a global maxima will be\nreached.\nOur approach is influenced by Atkinson and Birch\u2019s (1970) dynamics of\naction (DOA) model and Revelle and Condon\u2019s (2015) reparameterization\nof the DOA, called the cues, tendencies, action (CTA) model. Revelle and\nCondon suggest that their reparameterized DOA can be modeled as a neural\nnetwork model.\nIn other work (e.g. Read et al. 2010; Read et al. 2017a) we have argued that\npersonality (individual differences in patterns of behavior over situations) arises\nfrom individual differences in characteristics of motivational systems and indi-\nvidual differences in the motivational affordances of situations. We address that\nissue to a limited extent in the current chapter, but the above papers provide\nmore detailed accounts.\nTheoretical Background\nIn the following section, we describe the major components of our model\nand how they are tied together. We first describe the structure and nature ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We then describe our\nconceptualization of situations and how the affordances of situations interact\nwith the motivational systems. Following this, we discuss the central concept\nof wanting and how people\u2019s wanting for things is a multiplicative function of\nthe affordances of the situation and the current interoceptive or bodily state.\nSee Figure 7.1 for the overall structure of the model and the flow of influence\namong elements. After describing the conceptual structure of the model, we\ndescribe how it is implemented as a neural network.\nMotivational Systems\nAt the broadest level in our model, based on considerable neurobiological\nand psychological work, there are two broad motivational systems. There is\nan Approach or behavioral approach system (BAS) (e.g. Gray 1987; Depue\nand Collins 1999; Gray and McNaughton 2000; Clark and Watson 2008) that\ngoverns sensitivity to cues signaling reward, as well as cues signaling the\nomission of punishment. And there is an Avoidance or behavioral inhibition\nsystem (BIS) (e.g. Gray 1987; Gray and McNaughton 2000; Clark and Watson\n2008) that governs sensitivity to cues of punishment or threat. Gray (1987)\noriginally termed this system the BIS, but he subsequently renamed it the\nfight, flight, freeze system (FFFS) (Gray and McNaughton 2000), although it\nplays the same general role as the original BIS.\nIndividual differences in the Approach system have been argued to map onto\nthe broad personality trait of Extraversion (Depue and Collins 1999; Gray and\nMcNaughton 2000) and to depend heavily on individual differences in tonicDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nTheoretical Background 149\n(or chronic) dopamine levels, especially within the ventral striatum (nucleus\naccumbens). And individual differences in the Avoidance system have been\nargued to map onto the broad personality trait of Neuroticism (Gray and\nMcNaughton 2000; Corr et al. 2013; DeYoung and Allen in press), which is\ncharacterized by such things as social anxiety and fearfulness. Although there\nseems to be broad consensus that dopaminergic systems play a key role in\nExtraversion, there is much less consensus about the neurobiological bases of\nNeuroticism.\nWithin each of these two broad motivational systems are nested more\nspecific, task-based motives that have evolved to manage various everyday\nlife tasks (Kenrick and Trost 1997; Bugental 2000; Chulef et al. 2001; Talevich\net al. 2017). Among the more specific motives within the Approach system\nare such motives as mating, nurturance of young, affiliation and bonding with\npeers, establishing dominance hierarchies, insuring attachment to caregivers,\nacquiring resources, and more physical motives dealing with such things as\nhunger, thirst, and sleep. Important motives within the Avoidance system are\navoiding social rejection and avoiding physical harm. We should note that for\nhighly social species, such as humans, being a member of a group is critical for\nlong-term survival. Thus, avoiding social rejection plays an important role in\navoiding physical harm.\nIndividuals obviously differ in the chronic importance of all of these motives.\nThese individual differences in chronic motive importance are an important\nbasis of personality. Although there are chronic individual differences in a vari-\nety of different motives, the proximal driver of choice will be the current levels\nof different motives (which are strongly, although not uniquely, influenced by\nchronic importance of motives).\nSituations\nA key part of our model is our conceptualization of situations. Although many\nareas of psychology (e.g. social psychology, personality, ecological psychology)\nview situations as fundamental to understanding human social behavior, there\nis surprisingly little agreement as to how to think about situations, and the\nsuggestions that have been made for how to characterize situations are not par-\nticularly conducive to creating simulations of the interactions between people\nand situations. Years ago we argued (Read and Miller 1989; Miller and Read\n1991) that situations can be conceptualized as motive or goal-based structures\nthat consist of the motives afforded by the situation, physical attributes of the\nsituation, and the typical roles and scripts that can be enacted in the situation\n(Argyle et al. 1981). Information about the current situational affordances then\nactivates the potential motives that an individual might pursue in that situa-\ntion. A situation that affords academic pursuits provides various affordances\nfor achievement and will activate motives related to achievement. A situation\nthat affords romantic pursuits provides very different affordances.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n150 A Neural Network Model of Motivated Decision-Making in Everyday Social Behavior\nIn addition to arguing for the validity of this conceptualization of situations,\nwe also propose that this conceptualization is extremely useful for creating\nsimulations of human social behavior. Many models of individual agents in\nAI and cognitive science focus on agents as pursuing particular goals and\nengaged in planning and goal-directed behavior. With this conceptualization\nof agents and our conceptualization of situations, it is straightforward to create\na model of how an agent would interact with different situations. Recognition\nof the situation that an agent is in provides information about the relevant\ngoals that can be pursued at the current time in the current situation, and\nthis information can be easily integrated with the goal-directed systems in the\nagent to generate behavior.\nInteroceptive or Bodily State\nThe strength of motivation or desire is not just a function of the chronic motive\nand the strength of situational cues. It is also a function of the current degree of\nsatiation or need, which is conveyed by a signal about the current interoceptive\nor bodily state relevant to that cue (e.g. Bechara and Naqvi 2004; Tindell et al.\n2006; Berridge 2007, 2012; Zhang et al. 2009; Berridge and O\u2019Doherty 2013).\nInteroceptive state provides information about the current state of such things\nas hunger, thirst, loneliness, etc. (need states).\nWanting\nBerridge (2007, 2012) has made a convincing case for the distinction between\nwanting something and liking it once we have attained it. This is the distinction\nbetween the desire for something and the degree to which it is perceived as\nrewarding, once it is attained. Wanting can be viewed as the strength of desire\nfor something. According to Berridge wanting is a multiplicative function of the\nstrength of the situational cue (its affordances) and the current interoceptive or\nbodily state. For example, wanting social interaction is not simply a function of\nhow attractive other people are, but it is also a function of how lonely you are\nand how much you need social contact.\nWanting encapsulates two separate sources of variability in behavior over\ntime: the strength of the cue (or situational affordance) and interoceptive\nstate. As a result of the multiplicative relationship between cue strength and\ninteroceptive state, each factor can play a gating role in controlling behavior.\nFor example, if there is attractive food (strong environment cue strength), but\nwe are not hungry (weak interoceptive signal), we will probably not eat, or if\nthere are interesting people around, but we do not need social contact, then we\nwill not approach the people to hang out.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nNeural Network Implementation 151\nCompetition Among Motives\nA final important aspect of our model is that motivation is competitive. By that\nwe mean that the strength of motives or different wantings competes with each\nother for the control of behavior. Thus, the likelihood of behavior is a function of\nthe strength of wanting one thing compared with the strength of wanting alter-\nnative things. For example, if we are moderately hungry with food around, but\nwe are very thirsty with water around, we will drink. However, in the absence\nof thirst, the same amounts of hunger and food will lead to eating.\nMotivation Changes Dynamically\nThe strength of motives or wantings changes dynamically, as a function of\nchanges in the environment and changes in interoceptive state. As a result,\nbehavior changes dynamically in response to changes in motivation. For\nexample, in the example given above where we are moderately hungry with\nfood around but very thirsty with water around, we will initially drink. How-\never, as we drink, our interoceptive state indicating thirst will decrease, and\ntherefore our wanting for water will decrease. At some point the wanting for\nfood will then be greater than our wanting for water, and we will stop drinking\nwater and start eating. Further, if there is a limited amount of water, removing\nwater from the environment by drinking it will remove that affordance and\ntherefore decrease the wanting for water. This will allow wanting for food to\ntake control of behavior. Finally, if there was no water available initially, then\na moderately hungry animal with food around would initially eat. However, if\nwater became available, then the wanting for water would increase, and the\nanimal might switch from eating to drinking.\nNeural Network Implementation\nOur model is implemented as a neural network model. This allows us to\nsimulate and examine how our model captures an individual\u2019s motivational\ndynamics and changes in decisions and behavior over time. To create our\nneural network models, we use a software system called emergent (Aisa et al.\n2008; O\u2019Reilly et al. 2012). emergent provides a framework for creating all parts\nof a network and implements several different neural network architectures.\nWe use a particular architecture called Leabra, which is designed to be\nbiologically plausible. Leabra stands for local, error-driven and associative,\nbiologically realistic algorithm.\nNeural networks are constructed of nodes and the weighted links among\nthem. Processing in a neural network proceeds by the passage of activationDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Nodes are analogous to neurons or systems of neurons and\nrepresent features or concepts. Each node\u2019s level of activation represents its\ncurrent importance and its readiness to fire and send activation to the other\nnodes to which it is connected.\nNodes receive activation from sending nodes, integrate the incoming activa-\ntion from all the sending nodes, and then send activation to other nodes. The\nrelationship between the incoming activation and the output of the node is cap-\ntured by an activation function. This activation function may capture different\nforms of relationships. The most typical are linear relationships, S-shaped or\nsigmoidal relationships, and binary relationships (on or off ).\nNodes are organized in layers that correspond to processing components\nwithin the model. In Leabra, nodes within a layer compete for activation, and\none can manipulate the degree of competition between nodes within a layer, as\nwell as manipulating various other parameters of all the nodes within that layer,\nsuch as gain on the activation function or the threshold for firing.\nIn the current model (see Figure 7.1), at the input level we have the Situa-\ntional Features and the Interoceptive or Bodily State. We then have two layers\nthat represent the two broad motivational systems: Approach and Avoidance.\nFollowing this is the Behavior layer. Typical neural networks also have what are\ncalled Hidden layers, intervening between the different processing layers. Hid-\nden layers learn higher-order representations or conjunctions of lower-level\nfeatures.\nNodes are connected by weighted links, where the strength and direction\nof the link represents the degree and direction of influence. These connection\nstrengths correspond to synapses in neural systems. Links can be unidirectional\nor bidirectional. Given the massive bidirectional connectivity of the human\nbrain, bidirectional connections are more plausible. Bidirectional connectivity\nallows for such things as modeling processing dynamics over time, top-down\ninfluences, parallel constraint satisfaction processing, and pattern completion\nfrom incomplete data.\nThe strength of connections can be modified by learning or experience, and\nthe extent of learning from experience is a parameter of the links that can\nbe modified. The simplest kind of learning is Hebbian learning (Hebb 1949),\nwhich enables learning the correlational structure of the environment. Here\nthe weight between a sending and a receiving node increases if the two nodes\nare active at the same time. \u201cNodes that fire together, wire together.\u201d\nA simple version of Hebbian learning is\n\u0394w = \ud835\udefe \u2217 a \u2217 b\nwhere the change in weight \u0394w is equal to the product of the activation of the\ntwo nodes, a and b, times a learning parameter \ud835\udefe.\nA second form of learning is error-correcting (or task-based) learning, which\nseeks to minimize the sum squared error of prediction of the receiving nodeDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nNeural Network Implementation 153\ngiven the activation from the sending node. Here there is a teaching signal.\nWhen the receiving node fires, its activation is compared with the teaching\nsignal, and the difference (the error of prediction) is used to modify the weight\nbetween the sending and receiving nodes. Error-correcting learning is also\ncalled the delta rule (Widrow and Hoff 1960) and looks like\n\u0394w = \ud835\udefe \u2217 (t \u2212 o) \u2217 a\nwhere the weight change, \u0394w, is equal to the difference between the predicted\nactivation o and the teaching activation t, times the input activation a, multi-\nplied by a learning parameter \ud835\udefe. Because delta-rule learning seeks to minimize\nthe summed squared error, a network with a single output node is essentially\nlearning a simple linear regression model.\nWith error-correcting learning you might do something like pronounce a\nword, and then a teacher tells you the correct way to pronounce the word. You\ncan then calculate the difference between your output (how you pronounced\nthe word) and how the teacher says you should have pronounced the word. A\nkey point about error-correcting learning is that there is a clear target or correct\nanswer.\nA third kind of learning is reinforcement learning, where you are trying to\nmaximize rewards or minimize punishment. Here you are simply told whether\nor not you got the reward or punishment. There is no information about what\nthe correct response should have been.\nEach form of learning is important under different conditions. Hebbian learn-\ning learns the correlational structure of the environment. Error-correcting or\ndelta-rule learning learns from an explicit teaching signal that tells us what\nthe correct answer is, and reinforcement learning allows us to learn from the\nrewarding or punishing effects of our actions. Although each is useful, they are\nmost powerful when combined.\nGeneral Processing in the Network\nProcessing in the network proceeds as follows. Information about the\naffordances of the situation (external information) and interoceptive state\nconcerning all the potential motives (internal state) are applied to the Situ-\national Feature layer and the Interoceptive (Bodily) State layer, respectively.\nActivations from situational features and interoceptive states are then sent to\nthe nodes in the Approach and Avoidance layers. The resulting activation of\nthe Approach and Avoidance motive nodes is a multiplicative function of the\ncorresponding Situational feature activation and the Interoceptive state acti-\nvation, as well as individual differences in chronic motive activations, overall\nsensitivities or gains of the general Approach and Avoidance systems, and\nchronic dopamine level. Motives within each layer compete with each other,\nand the motives that win the competition then send activation to behaviorsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Since only one\nbehavior can be enacted at a time, the behaviors within the layer compete with\none another, and only the most highly activated behavior is enacted.\nFinally, the individual\u2019s behavior can change her interoceptive state (Satia-\ntion) (e.g. eating food will reduce hunger, hanging out with friends will reduce\nloneliness) and can potentially change the situation or characteristics of the\nsituation to which the individual is responding (Consume). These changes in\nexternal and internal state are an important source of dynamics.\nSocial behavior is highly dynamic and varies considerably over time, and our\nmodel captures that dynamic. A major source of those behavioral dynamics is\nmotivational dynamics, changes in what we want to do and what we decide\nto do. In our model motivation varies over time due to changes in affordances\n(opportunities in the environment for motive or goal-related behavior) and due\nto changes in our current interoceptive state that result from our own behavior\nas well as from the passage of time. As a result, behavior will vary over time and\nsituations.\nIndividual differences in the response of the motive systems can be modeled\nin terms of a number of different parameters. First, one can manipulate individ-\nual differences in the broad Approach and Avoidance tendencies. This can be\ncaptured by modifying the overall sensitivity or gains of the activation function\nfor the nodes within each system. Second, individual differences in the impor-\ntance of specific motives can be modeled in terms of individual differences in\nthe baseline or chronic activation of the motive. Third, experience can shape\nthe strength of the links between the situational features and the motives. As\na result, different individuals may respond differently to the same situational\nfeatures.\nAs we noted in the preceding, when creating our neural network models, we\nuse a particular architecture called Leabra, which is implemented in a software\nsystem for creating neural network called emergent (Aisa et al. 2008). emergent\nprovides a framework for creating all parts of a network and implements several\ndifferent neural network architectures. As in most neural network architec-\ntures, Leabra includes learning. The learning rules in Leabra allow the network\nto model the strength of associations between nodes as a function of their fre-\nquency of co-occurrence, as well as allowing the network to use prediction error\nto tune the strength of relevant connections. The basic forms of learning in\nLeabra are similar to the forms we outlined above, although they differ in some\nof their details.\nThe activation function in Leabra has an S-shaped form and has several key\ncomponents (see Eq. (7.1)). ge is the sum of the excitatory activation into the\nnode, whereas g\ud835\udf03\ne is the threshold for firing and is a function of the inhibitory\nactivation into the node. Thus, one key aspect of this activation function is that\nthe level of firing of the node is a function of the balance between the excita-\ntory and inhibitory activation into the node.

With-\nout random noise added to the activation function, there is a sharp threshold\nfor firing; with noise the slope is more graded. The basic idea is that neurons are\ninherently noisy so that even when the activation of the node is below threshold,\nit will still occasionally fire.\nThe network in Figure 7.3 provides a simplified version of the environmen-\ntal affordances and potential behaviors of a college student. In this example,\nthere are five Environmental features that identify five different situations with\ndifferent situational affordances: Friend, Library, Food, Social Situation (Soc-\nSit), and Danger. There are also five corresponding Interoceptive States: Affili-\nation (nAff ), Achievement (nAch), Hunger, Social Anxiety (SocAnx), and Fear.\nActivation from the Environment and the Interoceptive State simultaneously\nflow to the motivational systems where they are multiplicatively combined.\nIn the Approach system, there are three motives: Affiliation (AFF), Achieve-\nment (ACH), and Eat (Hunger). In the Avoid system there are two: Avoid Social\nRejection (REJ) and Avoid Physical Harm (HRM). The two layers can have dif-\nferent gains: this makes it possible to model the two systems as having different\nsensitivities to their inputs.

In addition, the different motives in a layer can\ndiffer in importance, represented by differences in their baseline activation.\nThus, the activation of each motive will be a function of the input activation\n(a multiplicative function of Environment and Interoceptive State), the sensi-\ntivity or gain of the system, and the baseline activation of each motive.\nMotives in each layer compete for activation and then send activation to\nthe Behavior Layer, where behaviors that are relevant to each of the motives\nthen compete for activation. The winning behavior is enacted. Potential behav-\niors are Hangout (Hngout), Study, Eat, Avoid Socializing (AvdSoc), and Leave.\nEnacted behaviors can then feedback and modify both the Environment and the\nInteroceptive State. For example, eating can reduce the amount of food avail-\nable, and hanging out with friends for a while can reduce the Interoceptive State\nassociated with Affiliation (loneliness). In addition, there can be changes in the\nEnvironment caused by external factors (e.g. a friend walks in) and changes in\nInteroceptive state due to things such as the passage of time (e.g. getting hun-\ngry). These changes to the Environment and the Interoceptive state are then fed\nback to the system on the next time step and may result in different behavior.\nIt is also important to bear in mind that there are competitive dynamics\nat both the motivational level and the behavioral level. This means that the\nultimate activation of a motive or a behavior is dependent on its own activation\ncompared with the relative degree of activation of competing motives and\nbehaviors.\nA run through of one example of a college student moving through an\nordinary day is shown in Figure 7.4.

Notice that different affordances have\nsomewhat different strengths, representing differences in the cue strength of\nthe different situational cues to the Affordances.\nThe second graph from the bottom shows the student\u2019s Interoceptive State\nacross the 14 time steps. Note that various Interoceptive States change over\ntime both as a function of the student\u2019s behavior as well as simply due to the\npassage of time (e.g. Hunger). Here the student starts out with a high need for\nAffiliation and a somewhat weaker Achievement need, both of which decrease\nsomewhat over time as a function of their behavior. Then at time step 7, the stu-\ndent\u2019s Hunger jumps and then slowly decreases because they Eat, as shown in\nthe Behavior Activation graph. Then at time step 10 the student\u2019s Social Anxiety\njumps and then declines slightly.\nWhen we look at the motivation/want graph, we can see that the motivations\nof the student change considerably over time. For time steps 1 and 2, the moti-\nvation for Affiliation is considerably stronger than the motivation for Achieve-\nment, and consequently the Behavior Activation for Hngout is the strongest.\nThen at time step 3, when the friend has left, the motivation for achievement is\nthe strongest motivation, resulting in Study. Then at time step 7 when Food and\nHunger occur, the Hunger motivation becomes the strongest, and the student\nEats. As the student eats the Interoceptive State of Hunger decreases, and the\nHunger motivation also drops. However, for several time steps there are not\nany competing motivations, and the student continues to eat. Then at time step\n10 when the threatening Social Situation occurs and the Interoceptive State for\nSocial Anxiety rises, the resulting motivation to Avoid Social Rejection spikes\nand is larger than any other motivation, resulting in the Behavior Activation for\nAvoiding the Social Situation. Note that when the student Avoids the Social Sit-\nuation, the corresponding Affordance disappears, and the resulting motivation\ndrops to 0. When that motivation drops to 0, the Hunger motivation is momen-\ntarily the strongest, resulting in a brief spike for Eat. Finally, at time step 12, the\nstudent\u2019s friend returns, and this new Affordance together with the continuing\nInteroceptive State of need for Affiliation results in a very strong motivation to\nHngout and the student HangsOut for the last time steps.\nThis example shows how the dynamics of motivation and behavior can be\nmodeled in terms of the dynamics of changes in the Affordances in the Environ-\nment and the individual\u2019s Interoceptive States. Further, although we have not\ndemonstrated it here, various kinds of individual differences can be captured in\nthe model. One can vary such things as the importance or baseline activations\nof individual motives, which will influence their activation strength, and the\ngains of the Approach and Avoidance layer, which will influence the sensitivity\nof the network to rewards and punishments.

In this model decisions\nand behaviors are the result of interactions of situations with structured moti-\nvational systems and of the interactions within these motivational systems. The\nbehaviors that result from these dynamics can then lead to changes in both the\nexternal environment and the internal environment (interoceptive state) that\ncan then lead to changes in decisions and behavior.\nA number of different factors influence the dynamics of decision-making in\nthis model. First, there are individual differences in motivational states, rep-\nresented by the overall sensitivities (gains) of the two motivational systems\nand the importance (baseline activations) of the individual motives. Second,\ndifferent situations provide different affordances, different opportunities for\ngoal pursuit, and potential attainment. Third, there are individual differences in\nexperience that lead to differences in the perceptions of the likely affordances of\ndifferent situations (e.g. is a party an opportunity for affiliation or an opportu-\nnity for social rejection?). Fourth, interoceptive states multiplicatively combine\nwith situational affordances to provide the inputs to the motivational systems.\nThese interoceptive states vary over time due to a variety of factors. Fifth, there\nare competitive dynamics among motives and among behaviors that ensure\nthat the enactment of a behavior is not simply a function of its absolute strength,\nbut rather is the result of the relative strength of the behavior and its relevant\nmotives compared with alternatives.\nIn addition to its usefulness as a psychological and neurobiological model,\nthis network can provide a computationally lightweight framework that could\nbe used to simulate the motivational processes and behaviors of agents in broad\nsocial simulations in a psychologically and neurobiologically plausible way.\nMoreover, because of the highly interactive dynamics of this model, a relatively\nmodest model can generate a high degree of complexity and variability.\nAlthough the model is currently implemented within the Leabra neural\nnetwork architecture within the emergent framework, it would be relatively\nstraightforward to take something like the student model presented here and\nimplement it as a relatively simple program. Both the environment and the\ninteroceptive state inputs can be represented as vectors, in this case each\nwith five elements. These inputs can then be multiplied and input into a\nstandard Leabra activation function for each of the nodes in the approach and\navoid layers, where the nodes would compete with each other. The resulting\noutput activations would then go to the behavior layer where one could eitherDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The behavior output could then be run through several\nsimple equations to model the effects of consummation on environmental\nfeatures and satiation on interoceptive states. This would modify the inputs\nto the model on the next time step. The behaviors of other agents and forces\ncould also modify the environmental inputs to the agent. Finally, a variety\nof different parameters of the model, such as differences in chronic motive\nimportance, gain or sensitivity to inputs, and relative strength of approach\nand avoidance sensitivity, could be modified to investigate the behavior of the\nagent both alone and when interacting with other agents.\nThis model is based on a broad base of knowledge from the fields of personal-\nity, developmental psychology, evolutionary psychology, and the neurobiology\nof motivation and reward. It provides a model of the dynamics of everyday\nchoice and decision-making that is firmly grounded in theory and research. As\nwe gain new findings and theory develops, we can modify the model to capture\nthese new insights.\nReferences\nAisa, B., Mingus, B., and O\u2019Reilly, R. (2008).

Matthews\nBehavioral and Policy Sciences, RAND Corporation, Boston, MA 02116, USA\nGalton\u2019s Problem as a Core Feature of Cultural Theory\nImproving models for social behavior eventually will require dealing with\nculture theoretically and empirically and in the statistical models that link\ntheory and evidence. Developing ways to meaningfully include culture could\nincrease the validity and credibility of social-behavioral modeling. Culture is\ntheorized to be inherited information that influences beliefs and behaviors\nand that is acquired through social learning (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981;\nBoyd and Richerson 1985; Durham 1991; Laland and Kendal 2003; Richerson\nand Boyd 2005; Dean et al. 2014; Henrich 2015; Mesoudi et al. 2016). This\nconception of culture is accepted by nearly all researchers working today on\nculture who employ a generally scientific approach, by which I mean striving\nto operationalize measurements of culture and to test hypotheses about how\nit operates. Yes, most scientific cultural researchers also do a great deal of\nqualitative research that may be solely descriptive rather than oriented toward\ntesting hypotheses, but they do not see this solely descriptive work as an end\npoint for the scientific study of culture.\nThe idea that culture is socially inherited information in fact characterizes\neven Edward B. Tylor\u2019s first definition of culture: \u201cCulture, or civilization,\ntaken in its wide ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes\nknowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and\nhabits acquired by man as a member of society.\u201d Although Tylor\u2019s definition\noften is panned by critics as the sum of all things people do, a close reading\nin context of Tylor\u2019s book reveals it is not. First, he specifies that culture\nis only that which is acquired by man, i.e. it does not include that which is\ninborn by genetic inheritance. Tylor was famously skeptical that there were\nany behavioral differences among individuals due to genetics \u2013 he coined\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

These analytic complications were real-\nized early on when in 1889, Edward Tylor gave a presentation to the Royal\nAnthropological Institute that detailed his correlational analysis of rules for\nmarriage and property inheritance across hundreds of societies. During the\npresentation, Francis Galton questioned Tylor as to how he could account for\nthe fact that various groups of people were differentially related to one another\nby varying degrees of shared inherited beliefs and behaviors (e.g. all the Scan-\ndinavian countries share a more common heritage with each other than they\ndo with other European countries, Pacific Northwest Native Americans share\nmuch cultural heritage, etc.). Galton argued that the fact cultures were interre-\nlated in this way meant the data were statistically nonindependent and there-\nfore inappropriate for correlation analysis that assumed independence of data\npoints (Naroll 1961).\nThus, the issue of statistical nonindependence of societies in cross-cultural\nanalysis came to be known as \u201cGalton\u2019s problem.\u201d Unfortunately, Galton\nhad no solution for Tylor. Among other factors, Galton\u2019s problem led some\nsubsequent anthropologists to write off the entire practice of cross-cultural\nanalysis. For example, Franz Boas, who had a tremendous influence upon\ntwentieth-century anthropology, considered Galton\u2019s problem to be fatal\nto the cross-cultural research enterprise (Naroll 1961). It should be noted\nthat nonindependence is not the same as unmeasured variables that are\nomitted from an analysis (termed \u201cunmeasured confounding\u201d in statistics).\nAn unmeasured confounding variable itself has a consistent relationship with\nthe outcome of interest. In Tylor\u2019s analysis of inheritance and marriage rules,\nperhaps an unmeasured confounding of inheritance would be a society\u2019s\noverall wealth. We might propose that being richer or poorer is consistently\nassociated with some types of inheritance and not others. When an important\nvariable is omitted from an analysis, it actually can bias the analysis to find an\nassociation of two variables when no association exists, because they are both\nin fact determined by the unmeasured variable.\nUnmeasured pathways of cultural or genetic inheritance are not consistently\ncorrelated with the outcome, however, and do not produce the same kind of\nbias as can an omitted variable (Figures 8.1 and 8.2).

Some adjustments are needed to model genetic versus\ncultural inheritance processes, but they share many similarities. The underly-\ning similarity of biology and culture as inheritance processes was noted early\non by Darwin, who said the diversification of biological species from shared\norigins was analogous to the diversification of human languages. In fact, the\nfirst fundamental advances in the algorithms for reconstructing evolutionary\ntrees \u2013 branching diagrams of lineages linked by inheritance \u2013 were made\nby German historical linguists in the late 1800s and were incorporated into\nevolutionary biology only in the 1960s. The reconstruction of evolutionary\ntrees and analyses of patterns on them are termed \u201cphylogenetics\u201d in the\nevolutionary anthropology and biology literatures. This specific term is used to\ndistinguish the study of branching relationships of organisms (phylogenetics)\nfrom other aspects of evolutionary or natural history such as adaptation by\nnatural selection.\nFor example, the data depicted in Figure 8.1 show that instead of popula-\ntions from different regions being scattered at random across the regression\nline, populations that share more common inheritance tend to be either above\nor below the estimated line. For example, Middle Eastern populations are all\nabove the line, and East Asian populations are all below the line. This pattern\nof clustered deviations from the line results in slope estimates for neutral genes\nthat are randomly too high or too low. Since neutral genes are not expressed in\nbody cells as proteins, they generally are not expected to be acted on by natu-\nral selection and so should not be related to ecological contexts. They will be\naffected by inheritance, however, because just as with expressed genes, they\nare inherited by offspring from their parents (Rohlf 2006; Matthews and Butler\n2011; MacLean et al. 2012).\nFigure 8.2 shows the effects of such nonindependence across many regres-\nsions of neutral genes all against migration distance from our species\u2019 origin in\nAfrica. Note that even before correcting for nonindependence, the estimated\nslopes are centered on 0 and they are not biased to be high or low as would occur\nif inheritance were an unmeasured confounding variable. This inflation of slope\nestimates around 0, however, still results in many false findings for statistical\nsignificance in which either a negative or positive association between the gene\nfrequency and migration distance is found (Matthews and Butler 2011).\nAnother potentially helpful way to understand cultural nonindependence is\nits similarity to spatial nonindependence, which occurs when data points close\ntogether in space tend to exhibit similar values. Kissling and Carl (2008) articu-\nlated an important distinction about processes that cause spatial nonindepen-\ndence, which they term \u201cspatial autocorrelation:\u201dDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

On\nthe other hand, spatial autocorrelation can be induced by exogenous\nprocesses that are independent of the variable of interest. These are\nmost likely spatially structured environmental factors such as geomor-\nphological processes, wind, energy input or climatic constraints\u2026\nThis important distinction of endogenous and exogenous causes of noninde-\npendence can be applied to cultural nonindependence as well. Galton\u2019s original\nobservation specified endogenous nonindependence, which is a concern only\nif one takes seriously that culture is socially learned information that therefore\nhas its own endogenous properties of replication, diffusion, social inheritance\nthrough time, etc. In principle, there is no set of other variables that can prop-\nerly correct for endogenous nonindependence, as it is not caused by other vari-\nables but instead arises from the inherent properties of social inheritance across\nindividuals and down through time.\nHow to Correct for Treelike Inheritance of Traits Across\nGroups\nEarly Attempts to Correct Galton\u2019s Problem\nResearchers have developed several distinct approaches to attempt solutions\nto Galton\u2019s problem (Naroll 1961). An early approach to correct for cultural\nnonindependence is to reduce the societies held in an analysis to a set of dis-\ntantly related ones. This is most commonly implemented through the standard\ncross-cultural sample (SCCS), which was a set of 186 societies devised by Mur-\ndock to be representative of global cultural variation but all distantly related to\neach other (Murdock and White 1969; Mace et al. 1994). The 186 societies are\npulled from the fuller set of 1250 societies in the Murdock Ethnographic Atlas,\nwhich has a set of societies closely related to the sample in the Human Relations\nArea Files (HRAF \u2013 http://hraf.yale.edu/).\nThe SCCS approach, although relatively common in the literature, suffers\nfrom two crippling flaws. First, it is ineffective for most characteristics that can\nbe measured on a continuous scale, such as rates of domestic violence or rates of\nreligious participation, because it fails to eliminate the data point nonindepen-\ndence within the reduced sample. Since much cultural evolution has played outDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Only the circled distantly related societies (A, C, E) are selected for the sample.\nUnfortunately, Galton\u2019s problem still exists because societies C and E are more closely\nrelated to one another than either is to A, and a new statistical problem has been created\nbecause information about the traits of interest from societies B and D has been lost entirely.\nthrough branching processes of descent with modification, continuous charac-\nteristics will never fully lose the nonindependence due to more ancient shared\ninheritances (Mace et al. 1994, Figure 8.3).\nIn the case of binary or multistate characteristics, the SCCS may effectively\nreduce or eliminate the nonindependence because these characteristics, hav-\ning a finite number of states, can become saturated with changes over time\nthat eliminate the nonindependent patterns (Smith and Smith 1996). This phe-\nnomenon is well known in genetic data as \u201crate saturation\u201d and occurs because\neach position in a DNA sequence can take on only one of four possible states.\nSecond, although the SCCS may correct for nonindependence for multistate\ncharacteristics, it does so at the cost of throwing out most of the data. Out of\nthousands of distinct languages and cultures, the SCCS retains only 186! That\nsimply is not an opportunity for future growth of cultural modeling and analy-\nsis, which should be striving to have better measurements and more sophisti-\ncated models, as should any branch of science.\nAnother approach to deal with Galton\u2019s problem can be to measure a great\nmany various characteristics of societies to include in statistical tests as control\nvariables. The World Values Survey (WVS) is likely the most comprehensive\nset of such cultural variables for modern nation-states (Welzel 2013; World\nValues Survey Association 2016), while the HRAF is the most commonly\nused for samples of traditional societies (http://hraf.yale.edu/). The recently\nlaunched D-PLACE website provides many of the traditional society data\nfrom literature sources related to the HRAF (Kirby et al. 2016). All three are\ntremendous resources for the social science community.

Galton\u2019s problem theorizes culture not\nas the sum of all things people do, which is the frequent caricature of Tylor\u2019s\noriginal definition (Tylor 1871), but rather specifically as the social learned\nbehaviors that people inherit from previous or contemporaneous groups.\nCulture is not a directly observed phenomenon; it is an inferred mechanistic\nprocess of inheritance via social learning. Considering the WVS specifically,\none of the main axes of variation across its many variables is \u201csurvival versus\nindividualist\u201d values (Welzel 2013), which correspond roughly to Hofstede\u2019s\nindividualism\u2013collectivism cultural axis (Hofstede 1984, 2001). Although these\nauthors always discuss this axis as cultural in nature, it also corresponds to\nwell-characterized genetic differences between populations in novelty-seeking\ngenes that likely arose as a selective response from the out-of-Africa migration\n(Matthews and Butler 2011) and likely still impact economic behaviors\nand development today (G\u00f6ren 2017). By measuring population pheno-\ntypes, approaches like WVS are providing a valuable service, but something\nadditional is needed to disentangle the specifically cultural component of\nGalton\u2019s problem.\nMore Recent Attempts to Correct Galton\u2019s Problem\nMore recent approaches to deal with Galton\u2019s problem focus on measuring the\npathways through which the social and/or genetic inheritances took place for\nany given set of data and then correct the statistical model accordingly. One\nsimple method, commonly employed in health research, is to use individuals\u2019\nself-reported race or ethnicity. Race is included as a control variable in regres-\nsion models for the outcome of interest. Many have pointed out, however, that\nself-reported race is likely to be a flawed correction for ancestry, since race\nis largely a recently constructed social identity rather than an accurate reflec-\ntion of cultural or genetic inheritance. For example, Irish, Italian, and European\nJewish people have quite distinct cultural and genetic inheritances but are all\n\u201cWhites\u201d in terms of American racial categories.\nA step further is to use actual ancestry information to construct scientifically\nmore informed buckets of individuals in place of traditional American race.\nThe ancestry category is then included as a control variable in regression mod-\nels. This approach is informed by actual information about cultural or genetic\ninheritance pathways but reduces a complex web of relationships to a simple\ncategorical assignment.\nSeveral methods attempt to make use of the full set of inheritance pathways.\nOne is to construct a set of continuous variables, usually through some form of\nprincipal component analysis or multidimensional scaling, that capture most\nof the variation in the original cultural or genetic relationships. These variables\nare then included as independent predictors in a regression model.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n170 Dealing with Culture as Inherited Information\nAnother approach is to transform the matrix of cultural or genetic distances\nbetween data points into a pairwise matrix of expected correlations between\nthem. Thus, you end up with a matrix that specifies the expected correlation\nfor any trait between data points 1 and 2, data points 1 and 3, data points\n2 and 3, etc. There are two basic implementations for this method, one that\nallows a flexible network structure and one that constrains the network to be\na treelike model of bifurcating relationships. The matrix then transforms the\nregression residuals in an autoregression model (the vertical deviations from\nthe regression line as shown in Figure 8.1). By transforming these residuals, the\nautoregression is intended to fully correct for Galton\u2019s problem but does not\ncompete with the traditional independent variables because it does not \u201cex-\nplain\u201d any portion of the variance.\nI tested these approaches to correcting Galton\u2019s problem with a set of 1000\ncharacteristics that I evolved independently along the branches of the language\ntree of Indo-European countries (Figure 8.4). Each characteristic evolved from a\nstarting trait value that then had amounts randomly added or subtracted down\nthe branches of the tree. This simulation process, termed Brownian motion in\nthe literature, draws the random deviations from the same distribution, but\neach tip shares the same deviation amounts in direct proportion to their level\nof shared ancestry in the tree. This results in closely related groups having\nmore similar values for an individual trait because they had more common\ninheritance of the traits value. Importantly, all the traits evolved completely\nindependently of each other \u2013 none of them were correlated, and no parts of\nthe tree were enforced to have consistently high or low trait values. I then tested\n500 random and nonoverlapping pairings from among the 1000 variables and\napplied the above methods to test the rate at which they inferred a statistically\nsignificant correlation using a 0.05 significance level (Table 8.1).\nThe results show that only the phylogenetic autoregression model produced\nthe correct 0.05 proportion of false findings for statistical significance. A phylo-\ngenetic autoregression specifies the expected similarity in trait values between\nevery pair of data points based on their quantity of shared ancestry on the tree.\nThus, it differs from techniques that use ancestry groups (random effects, aka\n\u201cclustered error\u201d models, aka \u201cmixed hierarchical\u201d models) as these do not spec-\nify on a continuous scale the expected similarities among all data points, but\ninstead simply specify that data points within the same group are expected to\nbe somewhat more similar to each other than they are to data points in other\ngroups.\nThe simple linear regression produced false findings for significance in\nover half the cases, and applying standard American racial categories per-\nformed equally poorly. Besides the phylogenetic autoregression, the other\nancestry-informed techniques cut the false positive rate almost in half, but the\nrates still far exceed anything acceptable.

Thus, the nonindependence, as expected, did not bias\nthe slope estimates but made them arbitrarily overly negative or overly positive.\nHaving the correct nonindependence network or tree obviously is critical for\ncorrectly correcting for Galton\u2019s problem in an empirical analysis. Most often\nresearchers have used some form of linguistic phylogeny that reflects the histor-\nical separation times of languages inferred from statistical analyses of cognate\nword lists (Matthews et al. 2016). Cognate words are useful because (i) they\nare reasonably available, (ii) they are definitely inherited culturally rather than\ngenetically or as a response to local environmental conditions, and (iii) a sub-\nstantial number of studies have shown many cultural traits are co-inherited\nwith language (Collard et al. 2006; Jordan et al. 2009; Currie et al. 2010; Mathew\nand Perreault 2015). So as long as researchers can be confident they are apply-\ning a tree that is relevant to the traits being studied, there are no downsides\nto applying phylogenetic approaches (Rohlf 2006). Correcting for nonindepen-\ndence in this way does not insert control variables into the regression that soak\nup variation and thereby reduce statistical power. The only problem arises when\nan inappropriate phylogenetic model is applied, meaning one that does not\nreflect the actual cultural inheritance process. Thus, some a priori understand-\ning on the cultural mechanics is needed on the part of the researcher.\nIndeed, nonlinguistic modes of inheritance should receive more attention in\nfuture research. For example, it is highly plausible that some cultural traits are\nco-inherited more with religious lineages than linguistic ones (Matthews 2012;\nMatthews et al. 2013). Additionally, some of the observed nonindependence\nof population data points might arise from genetic rather than cultural\ninheritances.

Atkinson et al. (2016) examined whether more\neco-friendly cultural beliefs or technologies were more important to the rate of\ndeforestation on Austronesian islands. They used phylogenetic autoregression\nmodeling to correct for data point nonindependence that arose from both\ncultural beliefs and technologies being socially learned phenomenon inherited\nfrom prior generations. Their final analysis showed that technological capacity\nwas much more determinative of deforestation than were cultural beliefs,\nwhich only mitigated environmental impacts to a small degree.\nMatthews et al. (2016) recently tested whether linguistic divergence pre-\ndicted political and economic behaviors of modern nation-states. This\nprediction was based on the observation that language divergence predicts\nmany cultural traits in traditional societies. One mechanism that may play out\nin the modern context is that countries influence each other regarding their\npolitics and economies, and culturally more similar countries may be of greater\ninfluence than are more culturally distant ones, either because countries want\nto differentiate from culturally similar countries or because they more readily\nadopt innovations from them. Consistent with this hypothesis, the study found\nthat changes in the autocratic versus democratic character of a country, and\ndecisions to default on national debt, frequently correlated either positively or\nnegatively across ties of language divergence over the past 100 years. Related\nwork has shown that patterns of economic development appear substantially\npredicted by population phylogenies (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009, 2011, 2013).\nDealing with Nonindependence in Less Treelike\nNetwork Structures\nRelated issues of nonindependence occur when we study how culture diffuses\nalong social network ties that are less treelike than those just considered.\nOften such networks are studied as relationships among individuals, but\nthey can characterize relationships among groups as well. Whatever entities\nare linked together by connections are called \u201cnodes\u201d in network analysis\nterminology.

Network metrics are\nfundamentally nonindependent because they are relational. Node A has a network degree\nof 3, B and D each have degree 2, and C has degree 1. There are only four ties in the network,\nbut the sum of degrees is 8 (3 node A + 2 node B + 1 node C + 2 node D) because each tie to\nA is counted twice and the tie between B and D is counted twice \u2013 once in calculating the\ndegree for B and once for calculating the degree for D.\nalso are nonindependent, since each tie is connected to two nodes and thus\ncontributes to both of their network metrics (Figure 8.5).\nNetwork autoregression models can be used to account for these issues in\nnetwork data (Leenders 2002; O\u2019Malley and Marsden 2008). However, com-\npared with the ancient cultural lineages like linguistic distances, the interpre-\ntation of correlations across network ties is somewhat more complex (Shalizi\nand Thomas 2011). This is because the network ties themselves can form and\ndissolve in addition to the cultural traits diffusing on them. In contrast, England\nand Germany cannot change that they are both Germanic-speaking countries,\nwhile France is not.\nThe fact that network ties can change means any correlation we find in traits\non networks could arise from cultural processes (i.e. social learning) or from\na tendency for individuals with similar traits to form connections with each\nother. This latter phenomenon would require no social learning per se and is\nwell documented and known as homophily in social network science (McPher-\nson et al. 2001; Wimmer and Lewis 2010). Individuals exhibit homophily based\non sex, race, class, and a number of other attributes (McPherson et al. 2001).\nMost traits probably arise from a mix of homophily and social influence.\nDetermining Which Network Is Most Important for a Cultural Trait\nRegardless of the process for any particular case, applied modelers often\nneed to know which of several potential networks are most involved in the\ncultural diffusion or homophily dynamics. Even if distinguishing homophily\nand influence with observational data is fundamentally confounded (Shalizi\nand Thomas 2011), knowing the most important network for a certain set of\ntraits is a first step necessary for most applied and theoretical analyses. Which\nnetworks should be considered among the \u201cpotentials\u201d usually will be highly\ncontext and data set specific, but within that context-specific set, we should\nhave statistical methods that reliably discriminate their relative importances.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

(2013)\nassessed whether letter correspondences among leaders or historical congrega-\ntional connections were most important to groups sharing violent ideologies in\ncommon. Knowing the answer to such a question clearly can guide whether pol-\nicy interventions should target leaders or congregations regardless of whether\nthe generative mechanism for the correlation is homophily or influence.\nHere again, autoregression is one approach that could be applied, but previ-\nous studies have shown that at least the most common implementation (lnam\nin R) suffers from poor statistical performance (Leenders 2002; Mizruchi and\nNeuman 2008; Neuman and Mizruchi 2010; Matthews et al. 2016; Dittrich et al.\n2017; Karimov and Matthews 2017). Another long-standing technique relies\non using permutations to assess the statistical significance of trait correlations\nacross network ties. The classical version of this is the Mantel permutation of\nthe dependent variable, which is known to have statistical failures when the\nnetwork independent variables are correlated with each other (Dekker et al.\n2007). More recently developed permutation approaches permute the regres-\nsion residuals rather than the dependent variable and by doing so exhibit much\nmore robust statistical properties (Dekker et al. 2007).\nAnother approach to deal with nonindependence in network data is to use\nrandom effects that effectively allow for some individuals to have high or low\nvalues in the dependent variable just based on their identity. The idea here is\nthat network data conform in a sense to a kind of repeated measure \u2013 all of\nmy network connections have a repeated identity in common \u2013 myself. This\napproach was developed independently by de Nooy (2011) and O\u2019Malley and\nChristakis (2011) in the context of modeling the formation and dissolution\nof ties in networks. Matthews et al. (2013) proposed this method might\nbe equally useful for dependent variables that center on the similarity of a\ndiffusing trait on a network rather than the formation of the network ties\nthemselves.\nMore recently Karimov and Matthews (2017) published a reasonably\ncomplete set of agent-based diffusion simulations to systematically evaluate\nthe statistical performance of autoregression (implemented through the\nlnam function in the R package sna), the permutation approach of Dekker\net al. (2007) (implemented through the netlm function in R package sna),\nand the random effects method (implemented through the lmer function in\nR package lme4). We found that the random effects method provided the\nhighest statistical power and nearly always produced statistically correct false\npositive rates. The permutation method had close to the power of random\neffects and usually acceptable false positive rates except in some conditions\nwith treelike (i.e. bifurcating) network structures.

Because one or more\nof the traits may have diffused through the network, the data are statistically\nnonindependent. Although cultural diffusion on networks usually is not con-\nceptualized as cross-generational inheritance, it is still an inheritance process\nin that each node is acquiring trait values from other nodes over some amount\nof time lag.\nAs before, I conducted a set of 1000 simulated continuous traits, but this time\nthe traits diffused across the network of connections across countries implied\nby the Indo-European language tree (Figure 8.6). To simulate a rapid diffusion\nprocess, in each simulation the trait values were drawn at random from a nor-\nmal distribution. Then each node adopted 20% of their connections\u2019 average\ndeviation from their own trait value. The 20% adoption was weighted by the\nvalues of the network ties, which were the years of separation between coun-\ntries due to language divergence or colonial independence. I then evaluated the\nsame five statistical models on their ability to produce statistically correct false\npositive rates (Table 8.2).\nCompared with the phylogenetic simulations (Table 8.1), more of the statis-\ntical methods performed well and produced acceptable false positive rates for\nthe network diffusion simulations. Once again, however, simple linear regres-\nsion and regression with the American racial categories produced unacceptably\nhigh false positive rates. Of the methods that used ancestry information, only\nthe lnam R function that implements a network autoregression model failed\nto produce the expected 0.05 false positive rate. Since the math underlying\nthis function was intended to correct for exactly this type of simulated process\n(Leenders 2002; O'Malley and Marsden 2008), it suggests there may be some\nfundamental errors in how lnam currently is implemented into code. As with\nthe phylogenetic simulations and as expected from theory, the slope estimates\nwere centered on zero such that the false significance findings were equally for\nnegative or positive associations between the uncorrelated variables (data sup-\nplement).\nExample Applications\nNetwork models have been applied in numerous studies of cultural diffusion.\nStudies on the diffusion of health behaviors have been particularly prominent.\nAmong the most prominent would be the findings that obesity spread acrossDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Subsequent research has shown that the original obesity findings\nfrom Framingham are likely correct (VanderWeele 2011), but a good deal of\ntime, effort, and controversy might have been saved if issues like network non-\nindependence had been dealt with up front.\nFuture Directions for Formal Modeling of Culture\nSocial scientists outside of scientific anthropology, the latter being admittedly\na small social clique, may be surprised to learn that a reasonably comprehen-\nsive set of formal methods have been devised for dealing with cultural data\nat the levels of variation across groups, variation across relationships within\ngroups of varying size, and variation among individuals within small and even\ntightly interrelated groups. While the methods are comprehensive, there are\nstill important methodological developments to undertake.\nImproved Network Autoregression Implementations\nAt least in contemporary settings after the effects of colonialism and moder-\nnity, strictly bifurcating phylogenetic models may be inappropriate for\ncross-cultural analyses, although in my network simulations above the phy-\nlogenetic model actually performed well.

Likely there is simply some implementation problem in lnam, as\nstatistical theory would argue that this model should work as advertised. There\ncould be unresolved statistical issues as well.\nA Global Data Set of Expected Nonindependence to Solve Galton\u2019s\nProblem\nWhile this chapter and this volume as a whole both focus on modeling, future\ndevelopment of formal cultural models will be seriously compromised if more\nand better data collection is not conducted. More than 128 years after Galton\nidentified the problem of cultural nonindependence, anthropologists still\nhave not produced a global assessment of expected nonindependence among\ncultural data points. Linguistic, religious, and genetic divergences would\nprovide complementary views for alternative pathways by which traits could\nbe inherited. Sufficient linguistic and genetic data are available to produce a\nglobal network of expected nonindependence at least for country-level data\npoints. These linguistic and genetic data are, however, mostly published in\nanthropological data sets that are organized by ancient ethnic origins rather\nthan by modern nation-state. This is because anthropologists have been\ninterested primarily in reconstructing the genetic and linguistic histories of\npopulations rather than applying knowledge of these histories to the modern\nperiod. For example, during genetic data collection, anthropologists have\nfrequently excluded individuals for whom all four grandparents were not from\nthe same small geographic area.\nConstructing a global religious network presents greater challenges. Even\nthough the historical divergences among major religions are reasonably well\nknown, the percentage of adherents by country is more poorly recorded for\nnon-Christian denominations than for Christian ones (Johnson and Grim 2008,\n2013; Hackett et al. 2015). For example, data on even the basic Sunni\u2013Shiite\ndivision within Islam are scarce for most countries, and data on adherents of\nthe theological schools within these two branches are virtually nonexistent. The\nreasons that one of humanity\u2019s most ancient and enduring cultural systems\n(religion) is so systematically unmeasured are several: much of social science\nsince Marx has had antipathy toward the subject, some governments like the\nUnited States do not collect religious affiliation in census data due to separation\nof church and state issues, many governments have inaccurate census recordsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Articles with sophisticated statistical models rely\nroutinely on decades-old binary measurements of continuous variables. Several\nmodern efforts are ongoing that may provide foundations for more system-\natic data collection in the future. D-PLACE is one resource that improves the\nability for researchers to systematically use existing data by linking HRAF data\nwith ecological and linguistic resources in a modern database structure. How-\never, the data themselves are often relatively coarse-grained variables that were\ncoded 50+ years ago (Kirby et al. 2016).\nThe WVS is arguably the best example of an ongoing systematic data col-\nlection effort relevant to cultural research. The WVS samples individual-level\ndata longitudinally and from about 80 contemporary countries (Inglehart et al.\n2005; Welzel 2013). This is an impressive accomplishment but obviously leaves\nout historical data, data from many smaller countries, and WVS focuses on\nvalues and so excludes more ecological variables.\nTwo other newer efforts are The Database of Religious History and Seshat:\nGlobal History Databank (Turchin et al. 2015; Slingerland and Sullivan 2017).\nBoth are trying to conduct new data collection by systematically coding\nprimary and secondary source documents on various contemporaneous and\nhistorical world cultures and religious traditions. As the efforts are new, only\nthe future will tell if they will be able to sustain the level of effort needed\nto build ongoing and robust data resources. Advantages of these efforts\nare that they are not constrained to modern populations or to national samples\nthat tend to capture mostly majority viewpoints. Both are attempting to sample\nthe historical record and to include religious or cultural traditions of minority\ngroups.\nWhile selecting samples of global variations can be perfectly valid for\ntesting certain hypotheses, in my view greater global sampling would be a key\ncontribution that The Database of Religious History or Seshat might provide.\nFor example, Seshat is currently working on a World 30 sample that provides\ndata on 30 representative locations across the globe over historical time.\nBecause only group-level attributes are being collected, I think one advance\nsomething like Seshat can provide over WVS would be to vastly increase\nsample size beyond the \u223c80 modern nations included in WVS.\nThe question might be asked, \u201cbut how much sample is enough?\u201d I agree\nthat large samples are not always necessary. I myself have published statistical\nanalyses with quite small sample sizes. Many questions in the social sciences\nare, in fact, only applicable to constrained subsets of global variation.

That being said, reasonably compre-\nhensive global-scale cultural databases potentially could facilitate global-scale\nanalyses of broadly applicable questions and also provide easily accessible data\nsubsets for more targeted analyses. At least for group-level measurements, the\ndata size involved is not large by modern \u201cbig data\u201d standards. There are about\n7000 languages globally (Simons and Fennig 2018) and likely far fewer distinct\nreligious denominations. When I worked in industry, I had access to datasets\nwith records on tens of millions of individual Americans. Finding and justifying\nfunding for social science is always a challenge, but we as a society should take\na step back to question why we are willing to make the monetary investment\nrequired to aggregate records on tens of millions of individuals to sell more\nconsumer goods, but we can\u2019t find the resources to study group-level charac-\nteristics of several thousand languages or religions that continue to shape many\nfeatures of our modern world.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like first to thank my coauthors on A Manual for Cultural Analysis,\nDavid Kennedy and Ryan Brown, who both have influenced my views of these\ntopics over the past couple years we spent writing the manual together.

Fake news. Bots. Trolls. Social media. Information operations.\nWith news stories and television reports rife with references to recent alleged\noperations from Russian-linked actors, it would be easy to conclude that we\nare living in an age of unprecedented activity of international information\noperations activity, complete with Cold War era intrigue and espionage. Yet\nhistorians would be quick to point out that despite this recent wave of hysteria,\nthis latest activity is only the latest crest in the larger ebb and flow of a tide\nof international tensions. Intelligence professionals have similarly described a\nconstant din of monitoring and activity that has been largely invisible to the\ngeneral public.\nSo, what has changed? A new state of technological hyperconnectivity has\nprovided governments and associated actors with the ability to connect directly\nwith local populations in unprecedented ways. The unification of social media\nand the news into a signal platform has catalyzed the effectiveness of recent\nefforts to color political activity and discourse. Given the local impact, once\nsurreptitious tactics in information operations are increasingly part of public\ndiscourse. Overall, changing technology has altered the complex interactions\nthat have long happened between state actors and local populations and pro-\nvided new and often contested abilities to shape how people think and act.\nThis chapter utilizes an anthropological framework to illustrate these changes\nand to outline how computational approaches need to embrace some of the\ncomplexities in these new types of human interactions. One of the chapter\u2019s\nmain points is \u201cethnography meets modeling,\u201d in which our ability to produce\nbetter data and better analyses relies on grasping the relevant factors that play\nout on the ground via technological hyperconnectivity.

Our approach here will be to consider both actors and the information\nenvironments we create and manipulate as essential to producing the types of\ncomplex understandings needed to model and analyze the enormous data that\ngets generated about our social interactions via social media.\nWe will use the example of hybrid warfare to analyze some of the changes\nthat have happened to the strategies that actors employ and the ways that peo-\nple understand and act on the information in their environment. Historically,\ndiplomacy, political elections, and policy votes have all been significant tar-\ngets of hybrid warfare operations, the goal being to subvert, disrupt, and influ-\nence diplomatic and political forces in the target nation. Today, professionally\ntrained information operators can now interact directly, and en masse, with\nthe American populace, even as the US forces rely on these same social media\nsources to guide their own actions. How can we better understand and model\nthe changes in our information environment?\nThe Information Environment\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) defines the information environment in the\nJoint Publication 3-13 as \u201cthe aggregate of individuals, organizations, and sys-\ntems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information\u201d (Joint Chiefs of\nStaff 2013). The DoD describes the information environment as three domains\nthat interact with one other: the physical, the informational, and the cognitive\ndomains. The physical domain refers to those geographical, maritime, airspace,\nand cyberspace components that contain the physical infrastructure support-\ning the reception, transmission, and storage of information. The information\ndomain itself refers to the flow of data, text, images, and other forms of media\nthat staffs can collect, analyze, and report. The cognitive domain contains the\nminds of targeted individuals who are affected by and act upon the information.\nThese minds may be military or government civilian individuals, government\ncontractors, or civilians in the general population. As this domain seeks to influ-\nence the complexities of human social life, it focuses primarily on the societal,\ncultural, religious, and historical contexts that influence the perceptions of indi-\nviduals in the target nation (Department of the Army 2013).\nAnthropology offers up another domain that shapes the information\nenvironment \u2013 the cultural domain. Rather than reduce societal, religious, and\nhistorical contexts to how they shape perceptions, it is important to recognize\nthat culture structures the information domain on its own (and not solely\nthrough physical, informational, and cognitive dimensions). Differences in\nlanguage, in what counts as important, and in the types of official and informal\nprocedures used to interact with the flow of information are all dynamically\nshaped by cultural and societal processes.

The success of recent\nforeign IO efforts suggests the need for a disruptive approach to increase our\nunderstanding of how culture shapes individual actors\u2019 use of social media.\nWe propose that what has been missing is a \u201cground-truth\u201d element to under-\nstanding online culture that social science research theories and methods can\nprovide. Anthropological approaches work well with system theory, complexity\ntheory, and computational approaches. Key to this is identifying interdepen-\ndent parts and interrelating structures within complex conglomerations. One\nadded advantage is observing the study population in situ rather than in the\nlaboratory. Observing study participants as they interrelate and share informa-\ntion in a natural \u201cin the wild\u201d setting throughout their day provides significant\ninsights to bolster both modeling efforts within the behavioral sciences and\nnational security initiatives.\nSocial Media in the Information Environment\nThe Internet has transformed the way people produce, store, exchange, and\nconsume information, creating a new niche within the information environ-\nment that both adapts to the information requirements of its users and shapes\ntheir perceptions by the information it provides. Algorithms employed by\nsearch engines learn from our information consumption patterns and tailor\nthe flow of search returns to cater to our preferences. This ultimately has the\neffect of homogenizing the perspectives reflected in the search returns and\nmirrors back to us information that reinforces our worldview. The ability to\nconnect people to ideas is at the heart of the impact of the information domain.\nThis feedback function is readily apparent and easily accessible on social\nmedia. In the last decade, social media has revolutionized the way we interact\nwith others and share information. It has provided a convenient way to connect\nwith friends and relatives and the flow of events in our lives irrespective of the\ngeographical space separating them. The widening use of mobile technology\nhas fueled a steady increase in the volume of information shared and the speed\nof which it can be consumed. In the United States alone, adults ages 18\u201335\nhave increased their use of mobile technology from an average of just over two\nhours per day in 2013 to just under four hours per day in 2018, with 70% of\nthat time devoted to social networking (Statistica 2018).\nSocial media has also provided a unified platform for the consumption of\nnews, political commentary, and the organization of grassroots movements\ninto one consolidated space. In 2017, Pew research found that 67% of Amer-\nicans surveyed reported that they got at least some of their news from social\nmedia sites, with 26% of those reporting that social media was their primary\nsource of news (Shearer and Gottried 2017). Their research also shows a steady\nuptick in the number of people who report social media as their primary source\nof news from 15% in 2013 to 18% in 2016 at the height of the US presidentialDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

By far, Facebook and Twitter were the most popular\nsocial media platforms for news with 83% of those reporting using social media\nfor news citing them as their preferred news aggregator.\nWith this growth in online consumption of information, social media has also\nintroduced a layer of complexity into the information environment that influ-\nences users\u2019 perception of verity and prevarication of information. For example,\nsocial media amplifies the spread of false news. A study conducted by Vosoughi\net al. (2018) showed that false news travels faster, reaches further, and lingers\nlonger on social media than true news and that emotions like fear and anxiety,\nas well as the novelty of the news, are significant driving factors of this effect.\nThe researchers analyzed 126 000 stories tweeted by 3 million people more\nthan 4.5 million times between 2006 and 2017. The stories were designated\nas true or false based on six independent fact-checking organizations. Their\nfindings found that false tweets triggered a cascade of retweets, resulting in\nfalse information traveling faster and reaching further than true news. They\nalso found that this effect was more pronounced in fake political news than\nin fake news about terrorism, natural disasters, or other tragedies. This same\nstudy highlighted the emotional impact of these false news stories, too. The\nresearchers found that the false stories triggered the emotions of fear, disgust,\nand surprise, whereas the true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy,\nand trust.\nInterestingly, Vosoughi and colleagues were able to control for the role that\nbots play in disseminating data. What they found was that the bots shared both\ntrue and false stories indiscriminately, and when controlled for in their analysis,\nthey found that it was humans, not bots, that played a greater role in the dis-\nsemination of false information. Translated into anthropological terms, social\nmedia in the information environment works to promote and reinforce par-\nticular sociocultural views. No independent vetting of the information occurs,\nand the feedback happens through social groups that one views as familiar and\ntrustworthy.\nAnthropologists use the terms emic and etic to denote the insider\u2019s view\nand the outside anthropological assessment of the phenomena in question. The\nimplication of social media in the information environment is that only emic\nviews get promoted and reinforced. There is no independent evaluation but\nrather a multitude of competing views that run concurrently and often in iso-\nlated fashion inside our information environment.\nIntegrative Approaches to Understanding Human\nBehavior\nThe integration of cognitive science and anthropology offers great potential for\nadvancing theoretical and methodological models for understanding humanDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

There are many endeavors that build from the cognitive sciences\ntoward the social sciences and humanities. The general assumption is that\nmodeling of the human mind will then solve the theoretical problems that the\nsocial sciences have long studied. There is much value in this sort of work, but\nan alternative approach is also possible. We can build from the social sciences\nand humanities toward the cognitive sciences. Indeed, we advocate for the\nutter importance of that, because together, each approach can reveal the biases\nand weaknesses of other side and often correct them or at the very least offer\ninteresting data and insights.\nAnthropologists have long advocated for the importance of ethnography\nand qualitative research to provide the sort of evidence-based approach to\nhow people interpret and interact in specific settings. This type of work has\nshown value in understanding how pilots manage to navigate such complex\nmachines as airline airplanes; only by observing and understanding how pilots\nactually interact with all the controls in the cockpit of an airplane can we come\nto understand how cognition and context interact (Hutchins 1995). Neuroan-\nthropology represents one recent endeavor to integrative social science and\ncognitive science, with an emphasis on building from anthropology toward\ncognitive science (Lende and Downey 2012). An emphasis on ethnography\n(or understanding \u201cbrains in the wild\u201d not just in the laboratory or clinic), a\ncritical take on both anthropological and cognitive science approaches, and a\nfocus on understanding the processes can account for the variation revealed\nby field-based studies, whether those processes are social, cognitive, or some\ninteresting synergy \u2013 these are the hallmarks of how neuroanthropology\ntackles research topics.\nAt the same time, anthropologists have embraced agent-based modeling,\nsystem theory, and computational approaches as part of their research (Agar\nand Wilson 2002; Franz and Mathews 2011; Hofer 2013). This work has relied\non ethnographic insights in conjunction with modeling to understand complex\nproblems. However, this work has had difficulties in modeling complex agents\nthat accurately represent how people actually behave. Neuroanthropology\ndraws on the substantial body of evidence showing that human perceptions\nand behavior are dynamically and inextricably intertwined with the cultural\nenvironment (Lende and Downey 2012).\nWe now present an overview of three challenges for theoretical and com-\nputational approaches to understanding what is happening with the interac-\ntion of people and social media in our globalized information environments.\nThese challenges are based on the combination of ethnographic assessment\nof what is happening presently and the use of cognitive and anthropological\napproaches to identify relevant features of these current challenges. Below we\npresent an overview of the challenges before turning to an ethnographic mod-\neling of each one.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Stir the pot, so\npeople want security, stability, and sharedness. Given this analysis, a key ques-\ntion emerges: How can we turn from muddying waters to making meaning in\nthe middle, bringing together ideas from cognitive science, anthropology, and\ncommunications?\nMissing It\nIn both counterintelligence operations and in everyday life, many people do not\nreally see how media shapes what they think and how they think. They also do\nnot have many of the cognitive/cultural tools to critically assess what is happen-\ning. Focusing specifically on the national security side, operations are too often\nviewed through a technical lens rather than realizing that intelligence processes\nare also cultural. Intelligence analysis and the counterintelligence operations it\ninforms are cultural products. There is a lack of embedded and applied research\nthat can get at how analysis plays out in real-world settings and the types of vul-\nnerabilities that offer up for other actors to exploit. Applied ethnography here\noffers a vital way to develop data and applied insights.\nWag the Dog\nHow and why do people follow along with what \u201cmakes sense?\u201d Rather than\ntaking cultural consensus as a given (as anthropologists often do), an impor-\ntant question today is how people get caught between attention-grabbing media\nand larger cultural narratives. Using interdisciplinary approaches, we need to\nask, \u201cWhy do people \u201cfollow consensus\u201d?\u201d And what ways exist to insert the\ntypes of prediction errors, sensory feedback, and critical assessment that help\npeople reevaluate their ongoing engagement? Otherwise, we continue to put\nourselves in a position where other actors can manipulate our own institutions\nand values \u2013 they find the levers that let them exploit \u201cwhat makes sense\u201d to us.\nThe Ethnographic Examples\nBelow we present a series of linked ethnographic examples as a representational\nmodel. We move through three topics with three different actors, and in each\ncase, aim to produce an idealized version derived from on-the-ground sources.\nWe view this idealized approach as similar to modeling \u2013 identifying relevant\nfeatures of the actor and the information environment and the interactionsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We also aim to convey some of the com-\nplexity of the physical, informational, cognitive, and cultural domains of the\ninformation environment and thus highlight the challenges faced as we advance\ncomputational approaches and complex modeling.\nThe ethnographic examples come from a combination of research, profes-\nsional experience, and the use of secondary sources. Prior research includes\nwork on cybersecurity, how people interact with social media, and under-\nstandings of our rapidly changing information environment. One of the\nauthors worked for nearly two years first as an intelligence analyst and later as\nan operational environment designer for multinational joint training exercises.\nFinally, primary sources reporting on social media, news reporting, political\nconflicts, and local actors\u2019 lives provided further detail. The stories and\npersons represented here constitute an amalgam of this information. As such,\nthe characters and situations depicted here are abstract figures that typify the\nsalient trends that have emerged through this research. Before presenting the\nethnographic examples, however, let us set the stage with an example.\nIt is true that there is nothing new under the sun. All knowledge is within\nour reach; we need only to scour the vast depths of the Internet itself.\n- Abraham Lincoln, 1765\nNothing about the above quote is true. None of it. We stole the idea from\na social media trend where pictures of historical figures are accompanied by\nsatirical text. This was not a one-off ad lib, however. We did put some effort into\ncrafting lines that used a parlance and cadence that sounded literary, inspira-\ntional, and plausible enough to get the reader to go along with it right up to the\nvery end for a little comedic payoff. In so doing, our goal was to blur the lines,\nto play with the reader\u2019s ability to make predictions about future events based\non incoming information in the hopes of getting them to suspend disbelief just\nlong enough to defy those predictions and, in the end, leave them with a linger-\ning emotional experience. In short, our goal was to engage in a bit of theater.\nWe blur the lines here intentionally to illustrate the underlying point of this\nsection \u2013 that increasingly, the spaces between theater and fact in our informa-\ntion sharing venues are blurring, and this is hampering our ability to vet infor-\nmation. This blurring creates opportunities for people to intentionally muddy\nthe waters, producing confusion and turmoil for political ends. Let us now give\nthree ethnographic examples illustrating the phenomena.\nMuddying the Waters: The Case of Cassandra\nCassandra is a 58-year-old woman living in Central Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast in a\nsmall ranch house she shares with her boyfriend.

They live in a small community about five miles from the beach.\nAn American flag flies on their front porch, and another one is tacked above\nJonathan\u2019s workbench in his garage.\nCassandra comes from three generations of farmers in rural New Jersey but\ndecided in her teens that farming was not in her future. After graduating high\nschool, Cassandra decided to leave New Jersey and work her way around the\ncountry until eventually coming to rest in Florida, where she has lived for over\n30 years. Cassandra never had any children and never attended college. She has\nmade her living working in the restaurant business as a waitress and tending bar.\nCassandra recently passed through a crucial juncture in her life. She had\nseveral health scares over the past year related to the same hereditary heart\ndisease that claimed her father\u2019s life six years ago. After watching him deterio-\nrate and facing her own health issues, Cassandra has begun to make changes in\nher life. She quit smoking and planted a vegetable garden in her backyard. She\nhas started walking regularly and is active in her community. She takes great\npleasure sharing her harvest with friends and those in need nearby.\nCassandra has also taken a renewed interest in the Christian faith of her child-\nhood and now attends church regularly. She started a prayer group that she\ncontinues to lead. Cassandra has also become more involved in local politics\nby attending council meetings and recently established Facebook and Twit-\nter groups aimed at organizing community support for important local issues.\nThrough these efforts, Cassandra has gained prominence in her community,\nand that has given her a sense of purpose. She feels both connected and valued.\nBefore, she felt she faced a system that left her feeling powerless and alone.\nThe health costs her father incurred in the final years of his life were stagger-\ning. Then she was left with the additional costs of his funeral after his death.\nShe sees a system that is biased, broken \u2013 or worse, rigged \u2013 against people like\nher. People in her social circle have often had to make tough choices between\nreceiving medical care and paying bills or buying groceries. Then other peo-\nple told them their situation was the product of bad character, lack of edu-\ncation, and poor choices. In 2016 she sees an opportunity to help wipe the\nslate clean.\nCassandra starts \u201cPatriots for America,\u201d a grassroots movement dedicated to\norganizing voting momentum to change the status quo in Washington. Her goal\nis to organize voters to oust establishment politicians and usher in a new era\nof representation. She begins to do online research to identify candidates who\nare Washington outsiders, with a proven track record of successes independent\nof the political arena, namely, business. She believes these people will right the\nsinking ship of the American political economic system:\n\u201cAmerica has always relied on hard-working people,\u201d reads one Face-\nbook ad she sees. \u201cIf you remove jobs, you\u2019ll remove our country from\nthe map.\u201dDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

She is working full time as a waitress\nand still needs to find a way to pay for insurance and medication co-pays. If\nit were not for the extra income from her boyfriend\u2019s disability and odd job\nwork, they would not be able to make ends meet. The text is accompanied by\na picture of candidate Trump in a hard hat surrounded by Pennsylvania coal\nminers holding signs that read \u201cTrump Digs Coal.\u201d\nThe ad comes from a group called \u201cBeing Patriotic,\u201d and it advertises an event\ncalled Miners for Trump to be held in Pennsylvania. Cassandra investigates\ntheir home page and sees that they have over 200 000 followers and have\nsuccessfully organized several rallies in the Northeast. She clicks the \u201cFollow\u201d\nbutton, and before long she receives a message from a representative of the\norganization:\nMy name is Ted and I represent a conservative patriot community\nnamed as \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d \u2026 So we\u2019re gonna organize a flash mob\nacross Florida to support Mr. Trump. We clearly understand that the\nelections winner will be predestined by purple states. And we must\nwin Florida. We got a lot of volunteers in 25 locations and it\u2019s just\nthe beginning. We\u2019re currently choosing venues for each location and\nrecruiting more activists. This is why we ask you to spread this info and\nparticipate in the flash mob.\nCassandra feels the same spark of connection and purpose as when she deliv-\ners her vegetable care packages and attends city council meetings. She now\nknows she is a part of something larger than herself, something meaningful,\na part of a movement that may bring about a more hopeful future. She replies\nto the message and begins a back-and-forth on Facebook messenger with the\nperson known as Ted.\nIn the ensuing months, news that Being Patriotic and other online groups are\nRussian actors would reach Cassandra. She finds these reports revolting and\ndivisive. Trump supporters like her are now under attack. Perhaps this signaled\nthe beginnings of being persecuted for her beliefs.\nAfter all, she had personally interacted with these people online, and though\nshe had never met them in person, their causes resonate with her convictions.\nShe knows that they are patriotic Americans, just like the other Americans who\nhave shown up at the rallies she has helped organize.\nWith muddying the waters, a primary tactic used is to disseminate informa-\ntion that allows outside confirmation of an extreme position and promotes a\nsense of threat so people assess that information quickly based on their imme-\ndiate social group. As we will show in the final vignette, these state actors will\nalso generate counter-narratives so that people are confused about what to\nthink and thus tend to rely on one-sided positions that seem to offer clarity\nand certitude.

The end goal is to generate\ndivision between people and reduce trust in the state.\nMissing It: The Case of SSgt Michaels\nStaff Sergeant (SSgt) Michaels is a 28-year-old US Marine deployed with his pla-\ntoon to North Africa. He, along with 2000 service members from allied nations,\nis here to participate in \u201cAfrican Ghost,\u201d a massive joint training exercise that\nbrings together conventional and special forces for the purpose of honing their\ncraft in a coordinated mission simulation that takes place in a real-world envi-\nronment. Exercises like these typically last about two to four weeks, take a year\nto plan, and have become standard in the past two decades as increasingly there\nhas been a shift in focus away from unilateral action toward allied partnership\nwhen military action is used. Exercises like African Ghost and others provide a\nmechanism for military forces to work together and build versatility.\nIt is March of 2017. SSgt. Michaels is currently in the middle of a heated\ndivorce with his wife of three years. He is worried that he may lose his 8-month-\nold daughter in the split, and during breaks in the action, he can usually be\nfound in the corner of the sandy courtyard on base, chain-smoking American\nSpirit cigarettes while answering emails from his lawyer on his smartphone.\nHe looks confident in his uniform and dark tinted aviator sunglasses when\naddressing his squad, but in the unguarded moments of the breaks, he chews\nhis fingernails and rubs the bags under his eyes.\nMichaels and his team are part of a Marine Intelligence unit trained to col-\nlect, integrate, and analyze information from military sources as well as publicly\navailable sources such as news, blogs, and social media. This information can\nbe used to gain an understanding of the enemy\u2019s location and plan of action and\nhow the local population is perceiving and responding to the military presence.\nMichaels\u2019 team forms part of the command post operations, which is located\nin a room where a network of computers and servers project onto screens sim-\nulated satellite imagery, drone feeds, maps, and the notional locations of the\nunits who are participating in this exercise.\nIn a separate room sits the White Cell \u2013 the people running the exercise\nsimulations and those in charge of throwing curveballs like equipment failure,\nadverse weather conditions, ambush attacks, and other surprises to keep the\ncommand staff on their toes. In the back corner of the White Cell sits a team\nof intelligence operational environment designers. It is their job to ensure that\nthe information that Michaels and his team interact with is replicated as close\nas possible to what they would see in a real-world operation. To accomplish\nthis, the operational design team consists of writers, graphic artists, and media\nproduction specialists who are able to produce content, graphics, photographs,\nand videos that mirror the tone and style of various real-world news sites and\nblogs that respond in real time to the exercise events as they unfold.

He is asked to simulate a \u201cfake news hack.\u201d His objective\nis to create a false news scenario that the notional antagonist for the exercise,\nAmir Sham, has already been killed by coalition forces.\nMahmoud agrees, and the design team gets to work. Mahmoud orders that\nthe stories they create work as a direct counter-narrative to the military intel-\nligence (MI) reports that will come the next morning, which will not reflect a\nraid or any activity relating to Amir Sham.\nThe next day, the terrorist blog posts an entry saying that their illustrious\nleader has been martyred. Shortly after, a tweet appears containing a picture\nof the role player playing Amir Sham and holding an AK-47. It is juxtaposed\nagainst a picture of a different role player in a ditch, presumably dead. Mah-\nmoud orders that the face and head in the second image be digitally blurred\nand that any other identifying features be obscured to help sell the ruse that the\ntwo pictures show the same individual. \u201cTerrorist cell leader Amir Sham killed\nin overnight raid\u201d reads the tweet, which also contains a link to the terrorist\nblog post.\nThe design team also publishes an article on the exercise\u2019s mainstream news\nsite, such as Global News Network (GNN), that was patterned graphically and\nstylistically after the BBC. The article uses the blog post and tweet to report the\nstory but does not supply any new or otherwise confirming information.\nAt the day\u2019s briefing, SSgt Michaels and his team report the ruse as fact. Their\nPowerPoint brief includes the picture of the role player and the blurred-out\nbody in the ditch and a screenshot of the tweet and utilizes as confirmation\nsources the bad guy blog and the GNN article.\nThe training commanders are taken aback. Amir Sham\u2019s death effectively sig-\nnals the end of an exercise that has taken a year to plan. The senior officers call\nfor an explanation, and Major Mahmoud steps in to explain that the requested\nscenario was meant to test readiness against the emerging use of social media\nto spread disinformation in the intelligence environment.\nSSgt Michaels, still standing at the front of the room, clinches his teeth and\nshifts his weight side to side. He craves a cigarette as Major Mahmoud walks the\nSSgt back through his own slides, pointing out that what looked like data trian-\ngulation was in fact circular reporting. The blog is a lie, the picture fabricated,\nand the GNN article parroted both without verifying against an outside source.\nMajor Mahmoud points to the overall weakness in the information vetting pro-\ncess as something that needs to be addressed in future training scenarios.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Michaels talks things over with his gunnery\nsergeant. He says he knew that open source intelligence (OSINT) story and MI\nwere in conflict with one another. Then he says:\nThe OSINT report was just easier to read. Everything was right there.\nMI comes across on a dot-matrix printer, it\u2019s in all caps, it\u2019s not inter-\nactive, it\u2019s really difficult to get through a ton of it, quickly, and it\u2019s not\nalways as up to date as the OSINT. That OSINT looked legit though. It\nwas sourced, it had graphics and pictures, it had time stamps.\nEven among highly trained professionals, quality of production and visual\npresentation plays a role in deciding which information to trust. The example\nof SSgt. Michaels\u2019 experience is not just a fluke; it is substantiated with research\nshowing that false news that conforms to users\u2019 preconceived notions of the\ntruth is 70% more likely to be shared than true news and that the quality of the\nmedium shapes our perceptions of the validity and importance of the infor-\nmation and its source. In this case, the colorful graphics, gritty picture, and\ninteractivity provided an easier path to follow than the all-caps block text of the\nintelligence reporting format. Moreover, SSgt.

His job was treacherous, haul-\ning 38 tonnes of freshly hewn pine, spruce, and cedar from Siberia\u2019s forests\nin a 1970s Soviet era semitruck over an unpredictable terrain of frozen marsh,\npartially thawed rivers, and mud-slicked roads.\nHis father was extremely proud of his job. Russian forestry was a major sup-\nplier of wood worldwide, and the timber renowned for its strength and superior\nquality. Aleksandr approached his job with a proud smugness that came with\nobliging the Western world\u2019s need for what Russia had to offer. Timber repre-\nsented the bounty of Russia and was a symbol of superior socialist might. He\ntried to instill this pride in his sons in three or four days a month he was home\nin between runs.\nFedor\u2019s father did not provide much of an income for the family. After the\nbills were paid, there was little left for anything extra. His mother worked\nat the local convenience store in the winter to help offset the cost of using\nthe electric stove to heat water for washing dishes and bathing when the\ncentral heat was turned off or broken. But their poverty did allow the boys\nto qualify for federal tuition waivers for college. Fedor\u2019s brothers majored\nin business, while Fedor studied computer science. Fedor had dreams of\njoining ROSCOSMOS, the Russian space program, as a programmer designing\nsoftware for the International Space Station. He was a bright student, but his\ngrades fell short of qualifying him for a competitive graduate school tuition\nwaiver.\nAt the start of his internship, Fedor is charged with writing code to help VxTx\nintegrate cryptocurrency into their smartphone app. Cryptocurrency is quickly\nbecoming a popular trend among Russia\u2019s youth as it offers them a means of\ncircumventing the regulations of the central bank and allows users to obscure\ntransactions for goods and services they would rather not make public. Cryp-\ntocurrency exists in a realm beyond restriction and confiscation in an online\nspace governed by a set of negotiations that are neither capitalist nor socialist.\nThis emerging frontier is where the wild of a burgeoning digital economy meets\nwith the hard assets of the real world.\nDuring the internship, Fedor begins to idolize Pyotr, founder and CEO of\nVxTx. Pyotr started VxTx \u2013 a Latin alphabet stylization for Vox transmission,\nwith a nod to punk music roots \u2013 as a means of circumventing the govern-\nment\u2019s practice of monitoring private phone conversations. VxTx already has\nover 100 000 subscribers, and cryptocurrency represents the last step in mak-\ning these transactions truly and legally untraceable.\nPyotr dresses like a punk rocker \u2013 platinum blonde buzz cut, a dog chain\nnecklace, faded black Sex Pistols T-shirt, tight black jeans, and Converse Chuck\nTaylors. Pyotr admires the US ideal of free speech and loves watching torrented\nfiles of American TV shows like ER, Friends, and Lost. However, Pyotr is also a\nfierce Russian patriot, given to frequent tirades on how the expanding capitalist\nsystem of the West encroaches on Russian affairs.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Yet at the same time, certain commonalities emerge.\nThe three vignettes show specific actors interacting with specific information\nenvironments. Looking at the actors, economic, emotional, political, and\nideological factors motivate their actions and their interpretations of the\ninformation environment. On the environment side, there are the immediate\nmechanisms that provide content and feedback to actors. But there is also the\ncontext of the specific information environment and linkages among elements\nin that environment. The influences of context and connections are harder for\nactors to discern \u2013 that is one element of the interaction. The other feature\nof the interactions between actors and environments is the intersection of\nemotions and social media immediacy, as well as how feedback from the\nenvironment confirms rather than questions economic and political factors.\nEmotional immediacy in a confirming social context is a main feature for why\nactors do not see the larger contextual determinants of their behaviors. Rather\nthan being agentive, they are passively shaped because they lack access to\nthese features of their environments.\nThis summary points to a role where qualitative approaches of anthropology\ncan come together with the computational approaches common to modeling\nand to assessing big data. Actors need a signal to assess where the social media\nfeed they are getting fits into larger contextual determinants of the information\nenvironment. Here we propose the creation of a new approach that combines\ngeographic information services with computational approaches while at the\nsame time bringing in qualitative and critical insights that come from anthro-\npology\u2019s approach to culture.\nThe method of metainformation systems (MIS) is an approach to capture,\nmanage, analyze, and present the cultural data within a specifically defined\ninformation environment. MIS conceives of any information environment as\na cultural product \u2013 something produced by a group of people that feeds back\nto shape the thoughts, emotions, language, and behaviors of that group. It is\nnot enough to just look at the physical, computational, and cognitive features\nof an information environment. We also need a tool that can assess the cultural\ndimension of the information environment.\nThere are several key elements to doing this assessment. First, MIS recog-\nnizes that there is not one \u201ctruth\u201d out there. Different information environ-\nments will function according to different ideas about what counts and what\ncan be excluded from considerations. These larger framings, often presented asDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

That actors and the cultural contexts of information environments\nare shaped by larger framings and ideologies is a central part of what makes\nactors within that environment open to manipulation by people who know how\nto exploit larger framings.\nSecond, on the anthropological side, there is a need to move toward assess-\ning larger etic perspectives. Anthropology makes a distinction between emic\nand etic, where emic is the insider\u2019s perspective and etic is the outsider or\nresearcher\u2019s perspective. However, research in metamodernism, competing\nideologies, and science and technology studies all point to the recognition\nthat these etic perspectives are in themselves ideologies that shape the\ninterpretations of the researchers. For example, the worldview that comprises\n\u201cscience\u201d is an etic perspective but one that is increasingly contested in many\nof today\u2019s information environments. MIS can work to assess that etic framing\nof \u201cscience\u201d as it exists in different information environments. But to be able to\ndo that, there is a need to go meta \u2013 to recognize that ideologies or framings\nthat look truthful from the emic perspective (they make sense, are consistent,\nlead to consensus, and so forth) are a particular meta dimension of that specific\ninformation environment.\nMIS relies on the integration of multiple methods. One key approach, which\nwe call MIX, begins with assessing key features quantitatively and deriving a\nlatent variable based on these cultural items. The latent variable is thus some-\nthing that moves from emic (what actors perceive) to etic (an assessment of\na latent, often invisible factor that accounts for the variation in the cultural\nitems). But that latent variable is also assessed using a qualitative approach that\nuses a systematic approach to identifying features of a specific cultural theme\n(e.g. the latent cultural variable). Coding in qualitative research is basically an\noperationalization of a latent variable (the theme) that emerges from the data.\nOne important innovation that the MIX tool offers is its ability to judge the\nlatent cultural variable not just via item data (actors\u2019 emic views) but also via\na qualitative assessment of that latent variable in relation to cultural dynamics\nthat shape the information environment.\nThe main point for this chapter is that agent-based modeling needs a compu-\ntational method to better consider features of the cultural environment within\nwhich human agents operate. With continued development, MIS offers a way\nto assess specific information environments better than existing techniques,\nwhich rely on calculations from surveys and scales. Pushing further, MIS inte-\ngration can then produce assessments of how close or far from a particular\nmeta-narrative individuals are and thus provide an error-feedback mechanism\nfor people. By producing a latent variable measurement that is then adjusted\nto match overarching themes (MIX), it becomes possible to anticipate pro-\nviding an assessment to individuals on whether a particular social media feed\nthey have chosen matches up with larger cultural themes.

Does SSgt Michaels\u2019 particular intelligence assessment\nline up with military consensus or social media consensus? Are Fedor\u2019s actions\nconsistent with punk values or with Russian state values?\nWhat is clear is that anthropology and computational modeling need to\ncome together to better assess the cultural domains that shape our everyday\nlives \u2013 not just our everyday lives but also the lives of people who come\nfrom different backgrounds and espouse different values but are nonetheless\ninterested in learning more from their information environments. Applied\nmodeling, using an integrative theoretical and methodological approach typi-\nfied by MIS, is an important component to taking advantage of the emerging\ntechnologies, big data, and changing social interactions that typify our global\nworld today.\nReferences\nAgar, M. and Wilson, D.

Recent advances in analytic approaches and\ncomputational tools have provided new, complementary avenues to investigate\nthis difficult question. Noninvasive neuroimaging approaches (e.g. functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging, fMRI; functional near-infrared spectroscopy,\nfNIRS; and electroencephalography, EEG) measure brain activity while partic-\nipants view stimuli and make decisions, providing a powerful tool to capture\nobjective measurements of individual differences during task performance\n(Berkman and Falk 2013; Tompson et al. 2015). Analytic tools for quantifying\npatterns of activation within and between brain regions further advance the\npower of neuroimaging approaches to predict how individuals will behave\n(Kriegeskorte 2011; Bassett and Sporns 2017), how they will interact with\none another, and how groups of individuals will make decisions. In short, the\nfoundation of social neuroscience posits that measuring brain activity provides\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Studies within\nthe domains of health and consumer behaviors have identified a consistent set\nof brain regions associated with individual decisions and behaviors. These brain\nregions have been implicated in processing information about the reward value\nof choice and behavioral options (valuation) as well as processing social infor-\nmation about the mental states of others (mentalizing). Second, we discuss\nevidence that these same brain regions are also linked to aggregate behavior\nfor groups of individuals. Third, we discuss evidence that these brain regions\nare associated with how individuals will behave in social interactions. Finally,\nwe discuss evidence that the association between brain activation and behavior\nis moderated by social factors including social network position, culture, and\nsocioeconomic status. Throughout, we highlight recent advances that leverage\nmultivariate and network analysis approaches that emphasize different compo-\nnents of brain activity patterns to understand the neural mechanisms underly-\ning social behavior.\nThe Brain-as-Predictor Approach\nThe human brain is a massively interconnected network consisting of 86 bil-\nlion neurons with trillions of connections between neurons (Azevedo et al.\n2009). Human cognition requires coordinated communication across macro-\nscopic brain systems composed of both gray matter (cell bodies) and white\nmatter (axons; Bassett and Sporns 2017). The gray matter is typically divided\ninto brain regions composed of large groups of adjacent neurons that have\nsimilar properties, and these regions demonstrate specialized information pro-\ncessing and knowledge representation. The white matter provides the structural\nconnections between distant brain regions and is often described as the wiring\nin the brain (Vettel et al. 2017). Together, brain networks support cognition\nand human behavior by communicating information among brain regions for\nintegrated processing and rely on the structural connections to enable efficient\nand rapid responses across distant brain regions (Passingham et al. 2002). Con-\nsequently, coordinated communication across the brain is fundamentally con-\nstrained by specialized processing in individual brain regions and patterns of\ninterconnections reflected in functional connectivity of synchronized activity\nbetween regions.\nThe brain-as-predictor approach measures brain activation while individuals\nevaluate information about various behavioral options, and then uses that\nactivation to predict subsequent behavioral outcomes, often over the course\nof weeks, months, or even years (see Cascio et al. 2015b; Falk and Scholz 2018;\nKnutson and Genevsky 2018 for a review). The majority of these studies useDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

To date,\nthe brain-as-predictor approach has been applied to predict both individual\nbehaviors and aggregate group behaviors in diverse domains, including health\n(Falk et al. 2015b; Cooper et al. 2017), consumer (Levy et al. 2011; Genevsky\net al. 2017), and political behaviors (Rule et al. 2009). Importantly, in many\nof these studies, brain activation provides additional information about the\nlikelihood of engaging in a particular behavioral outcome, beyond what is\nexplained by self-reported intentions, preferences, and other questionnaire\nitems (Venkatraman et al. 2015; Falk et al. 2015b; Genevsky et al. 2017).\nIn addition to improving our ability to predict behavior, the brain-as-\npredictor approach can also yield important insights into the psychological\nprocesses underlying these behaviors. Studies using fMRI to predict behaviors\nfrequently implicate three sets of brain regions that are broadly involved in\nprocessing self-relevance, social relevance, and overall value of incoming\ninformation (see Figure 10.1). In particular, ventral medial prefrontal cortex\nSociocultural context\nCulture\nTasks and\ndecisions\nResponse\nselection\nSubjective value integration\nValue\nSocial\nnetworks\nMentalizing and self-processing\nTPJ PCC dmPFC\nvmPFC vmPFCVS\nFigure 10.1 Brain activation. Brain activation implicated in processing information about\nthe self, others\u2019 mental states, and reward value can be used to predict how people will\nbehave and make decisions. The relationship between brain activation and behavior is in\nturn moderated by sociocultural factors, including culture and social networks. TPJ, dmPFC,\nand PCC are frequently implicated in thinking about the mental states of others\n(mentalizing). vmPFC and PCC are also implicated in thinking about the self. Ventral medial\nprefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and VS are frequently implicated in processing reward value.\nSpecialized processing in these regions as well as communication of information between\nbrain regions is thought to directly support behavior and decision-making, at least in part\nthrough integration of self and mentalizing processing into a subjective value signal.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The\ndorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ)\nhave been implicated in social processing, including considering the mental\nstates of others (i.e. mentalizing; Denny et al. 2012; Saxe and Kanwisher 2013).\nThe vmPFC and ventral striatum (VS) have been implicated in integrating\ninformation from different sources to compute a signal of the subjective\nvalue of the information (Martinelli et al. 2013). It should be noted that\nthese processes often overlap and that several of the brain regions listed are\nimplicated across these functions as well. Indeed, researchers have argued\nthat these brain regions work together to process information about the fit of\nthe behavioral options to an individual\u2019s values, beliefs, and goals as well as\nto broader social norms, which are then integrated into a single value signal\nindicating the subjective value of the behavioral options being considered\n(e.g. whether to quit smoking, choose product A or B, donate to a charity, or\nshare a news article; Tompson et al. 2015; Scholz et al. 2017; Knutson and\nGenevsky 2018).\nPredicting Individual Behaviors\nThe majority of research using brain activation to predict behaviors has focused\non using an individual\u2019s brain activation to predict how that individual will\nbehave in the weeks or months following the experimental session. Although a\ndiverse set of research has used brain activation to predict behavior, we high-\nlight two domains that have successfully used brain activation to predict behav-\nior outside the scanner: health behavior and consumer behavior.\nWithin the health domain, the brain-as-predictor approach measures brain\nactivation, while an individual evaluates persuasive health messages and then\ntracks their behavior over the next week or month. A study by Falk et al. (2010)\nmeasured individuals\u2019 brain activation while they viewed health messages pro-\nmoting the benefits of wearing sunscreen. They then tracked individuals\u2019 sun-\nscreen usage the week after the study and compared it with their sunscreen\nusage the week prior to the study. Participants who recruited vmPFC more dur-\ning message evaluation were more likely to use sunscreen afterward, even after\ncontrolling for sunscreen usage the week prior to the study (Falk et al. 2010;\nVezich et al. 2017). Similarly, research in other health domains has found that\nindividuals who exhibit greater mPFC activation during message exposure are\nmore likely to engage in health behaviors endorsed by those messages, includ-\ning increasing physical activity (Falk et al. 2015a) and reducing smoking (Chua\net al. 2011; Falk et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2013; Cooper et al. 2015).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Research sug-\ngests that vmPFC processes the relevance and value of the messages to the\nindividual. In particular, the subregion of vmPFC involved in predicting\nbehavior change overlaps with subregions of vmPFC known to be involved\nin both thinking about the self and processing the value of objects to the self\n(Cooper et al. 2015). Moreover, self-affirmation prior to being exposed to\nhealth messages promoting increased physical activity led to greater vmPFC\nactivation (relative to presenting the messages without the self-affirmation)\nand greater subsequent behavior change (Falk et al. 2015a), providing experi-\nmental evidence that self-processing plays a key role linking vmPFC activation\nand behavior change (see Figure 10.2).\nIn addition to predicting health behaviors, brain activation can predict\nconsumer behaviors.

Consumer products that elicited greater vmPFC\nand VS activation were more likely to be chosen by individuals (Knutson et al.\n2007; Levy et al. 2011). Interestingly, brain activation can predict consumer\nchoices even when participants are not explicitly evaluating the choice options.\nLevy et al. (2011) had participants passively view consumer products in an MRI\nscanner without making any explicit judgments about the products and then\nhad participants choose which products they wanted to own after the scan.\nThe researchers could accurately predict which product a participant would\nchoose based on activation in vmPFC and VS during the passive viewing task\n(Levy et al. 2011).\nAcross both domains, brain activity in vmPFC and VS reliably predicts\nindividual differences in health change and consumer behaviors. These regions\nhave been implicated in self-related and reward processing (Lieberman 2007;\nAdolphs 2009; Denny et al. 2012; Bartra et al. 2013; Schurz et al. 2014), sug-\ngesting that people are more likely to engage in behaviors or make choices\nthat are high in self-relevance and subjective value. Importantly, in many cases\nbrain activation predicts behaviors with an accuracy above and beyond those\nobtained from self-report measures of preferences or intentions (Falk et al.\n2011; Genevsky et al. 2017). Objective measures of subjective value indexed\nby vmPFC and VS might therefore be providing novel insight into the value or\nrelevance of the outcomes to the individual\u2019s salient values, beliefs, and goals.\nInterpreting Associations Between Brain Activation\nand Behavior\nHow can understanding the relationship between brain activation and behavior\nimprove our understanding of the psychological processes underlying health\nand consumer behaviors? In this review, we highlight three core neuroimaging\nanalysis approaches that examine how the brain processes and represents the\ncontent of persuasive messages and how this processing predicts behavior. The\nfirst and most common univariate analysis compares brain activity between\ntwo conditions, where the only difference between them is the cognitive pro-\ncess of interest. This type of analysis underlies the research reviewed in the\nlast section, identifying that brain activity in vmPFC and VS reliably predicts\nindividual differences in health change and consumer behaviors. The second\napproach complements the univariate analysis by looking at multivariate pat-\nterns within a region. The core intuition is that the knowledge represented in\na region may be distributed across the smaller units of brain tissue within a\nregion (known as voxels in fMRI data). Whereas the conventional univariate\nanalysis simply averages the functional activity across all subcomponents of anDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Finally, our review highlights a third neuroimaging\nanalysis approach that uses connectivity methods to estimate task-relevant net-\nwork activity. Connectivity research posits that synchronized activity between\nregions demarcates the integration of information across regions, and thus the\nfunctional network dynamics capture the spatiotemporal processes necessary\nfor the brain to enable behavior.\nMultivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and representational similarity anal-\nysis (RSA) are two analysis methods to quantify how patterns of activation\nacross voxels within a brain region (or across the whole brain) relate to behav-\nior. They use the relative similarity of neural activity between pairs of trials to\nmake inferences about the content encoded in that region (Norman et al. 2006;\nKriegeskorte 2011; Nili et al. 2014). For example, Pegors et al. (2017) used RSA\nto investigate how vmPFC represents information about persuasive messages.\nThe multivariate patterns of activation within vmPFC successfully differenti-\nated information about whether persuasive messages contained information\nabout health, social, or risk consequences of smoking cigarettes (Pegors et al.\n2017). Furthermore, individual differences in the representation of message\ncontent in vmPFC predicted whether individuals would reduce their smoking\nbehavior after the study (Pegors et al. 2017).\nRecently, researchers have also begun to employ connectivity-based\napproaches to predict behavior across a diverse set of domains (Garcia et al.\n2017; Muraskin et al. 2017; Passaro et al. 2017; Brooks et al. 2018). Within\nthe behavioral change literature, researchers have studied brain connectivity\npatterns while participants viewed persuasive health messages, and results\ndemonstrated that greater connectivity within a network of brain regions asso-\nciated with the processing of subjective value was linked to greater likelihood\nof engaging in the health behaviors being promoted in the messages (Cooper\net al. 2018, 2017). These results suggest that integration of information about\nthe subjective value of the messages to the individual is an important pathway\nthrough which persuasive messages lead to successful behavior change.\nCollectively, all three of these neuroimaging analysis approaches suggest that\nthe individuals are more likely to be persuaded by persuasive appeals, choose\nconsumer products, and engage in health behaviors when they evaluate those\noptions as more relevant and valuable.\nPredicting Aggregate Out-of-Sample Group Outcomes\nBrain activation in regions that predict behavior change at the individual level\ncan also be used to predict aggregate behavior across groups of individuals\nwhose brains are not scanned (Berns and Moore 2012; Falk et al. 2012, 2015a;Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n212 Using Neuroimaging to Predict Behavior\nGenevsky and Knutson 2015). In a persuasive messaging task, brain activation\nin a small group of participants predicted the population-level success of a set\nof health messages (Falk et al. 2012, 2015b); however, the relevance of the mes-\nsage content moderated the relationship between brain activation and aggre-\ngate group response (Falk et al. 2015b). For instance, the relationship between\nthe activation in vmPFC, dmPFC, PCC, and TPJ in a small group of partic-\nipants who viewed anti-smoking messages and the percentage of individuals\nwho clicked on an email link containing one of the ads (as part of a large-scale\nemail campaign in the state of New York) was significantly stronger for ads\nthat were smoking relevant than for ads that were compositionally similar but\nbehaviorally irrelevant (Figure 10.3) (Falk et al. 2015b).\nAdditional research has shown that brain activation can also predict aggre-\ngate consumer behavior (Berns and Moore 2012; Genevsky and Knutson 2015;\nVenkatraman et al. 2015; K\u00fchn et al. 2016; Genevsky et al. 2017). One study\ndemonstrated that VS activation while a small sample of individuals listened to\nsongs of relatively unknown artists predicted how popular those songs will be\nover the next three years, such that songs that elicited greater activation in VS\nsold more albums over the next three years (Berns and Moore 2012). Activa-\ntion in vmPFC and VS also predicted crowdfunding outcomes (Genevsky and\nKnutson 2015; Genevsky et al. 2017). Images and descriptions for crowdfund-\ning projects that elicited greater vmPFC and VS activation while a small group\nof participants evaluated the projects were more likely to receive enough invest-\nments to ultimately be funded (Genevsky and Knutson 2015; Genevsky et al.\n2017). Additionally, ads for chocolate products that elicited greater activation\nin vmPFC and VS led to greater increases in chocolate sales in a supermarket\nwhere they were sold (K\u00fchn et al. 2016).\nWhile the above research focused on average activation in single brain\nregions, multivariate patterns can in some case better predict behavior than\naverage activation within a single brain region or group of brain regions\n(Genevsky et al. 2017). Whereas models incorporating average brain activation\nin vmPFC and VS (as well as amygdala, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus)\nsuccessfully predicted funding outcomes for projects on a crowdfunding\nwebsite with 59\u201361% accuracy (significantly better than chance), whole-brain\nmultivariate patterns were able to successfully predict funding outcomes with\n65\u201367% accuracy (Genevsky et al. 2017).\nAcross domains, the studies described above show consistently that brain\nactivation improves our ability to predict aggregate group behaviors. Brain acti-\nvation predicts group-level popularity of music songs (Berns and Moore 2012)\nas well as the group-level success of persuasive health messages (Falk et al. 2012,\n2015b), consumer product ads (Venkatraman et al. 2015; K\u00fchn et al. 2016),\nand crowdfunding ads (Genevsky and Knutson 2015; Genevsky et al. 2017)\neven after controlling for self-report measures of behavioral intentions or\npreferences of the test sample in response to the messages.

A recent study found that individuals who had greater brain\nactivity in VS and TPJ showed stronger susceptibility to conform to their peers\u2019\npreferences (Cascio et al. 2015a). In this case, both value regions and mental-\nizing regions are associated with adapting in response to information about\nothers\u2019 preferences, suggesting that people may be integrating these two types\nof information (the value of objects to the self and the value to others). More\nbroadly, people who are more sensitive to social cues in general are also more\nsusceptible to conforming to peer influences. Individuals who exhibited the\ngreatest activation in mentalizing regions during the common social experience\nof exclusion were then more susceptible to peer influence in a risky driving task\nin a driving simulator a few weeks later (Falk et al. 2014); these results suggest\nthat if one\u2019s brain is more sensitive to potential social threats, it may be adaptive\nto fit in by conforming to peer influences. Individuals who showed greater con-\nnectivity between mentalizing regions and the rest of the brain were also more\nsusceptible to peer influence (Wasylyshyn et al. 2018). These results support\nthe idea that filtering information through mentalizing systems is an important\npathway through which conformity in social groups operates.\nIn addition to capturing how people respond to others, brain activation in\nmentalizing and value regions is associated with how people exert influence on\nothers. One way of measuring this behavior is by looking at the brain regions\nand psychological processes that underlie individuals\u2019 choices to share novel\ninformation with others. Here, greater activation in vmPFC, VS, and TPJ pre-\ndicted what ideas for television shows individuals were more likely to shareDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nSociocultural Context 215\n(Falk et al. 2013). In other work, greater activation in vmPFC, VS, PCC, dmPFC,\nand TPJ was associated with decisions to select and share news articles (Baek\net al. 2017).\nBrain activation can also provide additional information about aggregate\ngroup social interactions. Scholz et al. (2017) tested whether brain regions\ninvolved in self-processing (e.g. vmPFC and PCC), mentalizing (e.g. dmPFC\nand TPJ), and subjective value (e.g. vmPFC and VS) would be associated with\nhow viral a New York Times article was, indexed by how often people shared\nthe article. Activation in all three sets of brain regions was positively correlated\nwith greater article virality. More specifically, the effects of self-processing\nand mentalizing on article virality were mediated through subjective value,\nsuggesting that brain regions involved in self and social processing index the\nrelevance of the information to the self and close others and that the relevance\nacross domains is combined into a value index, which then determines whether\npeople share the article (Scholz et al. 2017).\nCollectively, these results indicate that brain activation is a reliable predic-\ntor of broader susceptibility to social influences on behavior, demonstrating\nan influence on behavior that extends beyond explicitly persuasive messages.\nActivation in brain regions linked to processing the value of the social behav-\niors to the self as well as considering the social value of the behavior to others is\nparticularly relevant to these broader forms of social influence. As we will see\nbelow, however, the relationship between brain activation and social behav-\nior is also often contingent on social context. Social network position, cultural\nbackground, and socioeconomic status (SES) all influence what values, beliefs,\nand goals are salient for an individual (Markus and Kitayama 1991; Visser and\nMirabile 2004; Stephens et al. 2014), which in turn influences how they pro-\ncess behavioral options such as whether to quit smoking (Pegors et al. 2017),\nrespond to peer influence (O\u2019Donnell et al. 2017), or donate to a charity (Park\net al. 2017).\nSociocultural Context\nThe majority of studies examining the link between brain activation and\nbehavior focus on a direct relationship between brain activation and behavior,\nbut to improve our ability to understand social behavior, it is also important to\nunderstand the heterogeneity in the relationship between brain and behavior\n(Tompson et al. 2015). There are many ways that sociocultural context could\ninfluence behavior as well as the relationship between brain activation and\nbehavior; however, the two primary routes include (i) normative influence,\nwhere individuals engage in a behavior because of what other people care\nabout, and (ii) individual values and beliefs, where individuals engage in\na behavior because of their personal interests and concerns. A number ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n216 Using Neuroimaging to Predict Behavior\npsychological theories argue that both individual attitudes and social norms\ninfluence behavioral intentions (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975; Cialdini et al. 1991).\nExtending this logic, one\u2019s position in their social network, cultural back-\nground, and SES will also likely influence what norms and beliefs surround an\nindividual. As such, sociocultural context may reinforce and promote different\ntypes of normative beliefs about how people should act and what they should\ncare about; these norms may in turn influence the types of goals, values, and\nbeliefs that people hold (Markus and Kitayama 1991; Riemer et al. 2014).\nMoreover, sociocultural context should also influence how sensitive individ-\nuals are to these norms (Riemer et al. 2014; Stephens et al. 2014), which may\nbe reflected in the brain regions recruited when making a choice or evaluating\nvarious behavioral options.\nOne social factor that likely influences how people evaluate behavioral\noptions is social network composition. One study hypothesized the extent to\nwhich individuals have close friends who smoke should influence how people\nevaluate anti-smoking messages (Pegors et al. 2017). In particular, individuals\nwith more smokers in their network might be exposed to more examples\nof negative impacts of smoking and conversations about the desire to stop\nsmoking, which might influence how much the messages resonate with them\n(Pegors et al. 2017). Results confirmed that individuals with more smokers\nthan nonsmokers in their social networks who also had stronger multivariate\npatterns representing message content in vmPFC were more likely to reduce\nsmoking when exposed to anti-smoking messages (Pegors et al. 2017). This\nwork shows that persuasive content can affect behavior differently based on\nsocial context and thus how it is interpreted and received.\nIn addition to social network composition, an individual\u2019s position in their\nnetwork also influences how they respond to information about others\u2019 opin-\nions. Some individuals in a network are more ideally positioned to encounter,\nadopt, and share new information (Burt et al. 2013). This experience sharing\ninformation between groups of individuals might relate to an individual\u2019s ability\nor motivation to take the perspective of others, which would in turn influence\nhow they evaluate information about others\u2019 opinions. One study found that\npeople who are in a more central position with greater potential opportunities\nto broker information between people in their social network exhibited greater\nactivation in mentalizing brain regions when incorporating peers\u2019 preferences\ninto a rating of a smart phone app (O\u2019Donnell et al. 2017). Taken together, these\nstudies suggest that social network properties influence how individuals pro-\ncess behavioral options.\nSimilarly, Schm\u00e4lzle et al. (2017) examined functional connectivity during\none common social experience, social exclusion, and found that individuals\nshowed stronger connectivity between brain regions involved in mentalizing\nduring exclusion compared with inclusion. Interestingly, they also found that\nthis relationship was moderated by social network density, such that individualsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It is\npossible that social network composition influences what strategies individu-\nals use when interacting with others, which may in turn influence how they\nrespond to social exclusion. Frequently interacting with people who are not\nconnected with others in your social group may sensitize individuals to poten-\ntially excluding others and make them more likely to consider others\u2019 perspec-\ntives during social interactions (Figure 10.4).\nCulture also influences brain activation, including the link between brain\nactivation and behavior. Across various different social, cognitive, and affective\ntasks, people from Western cultures were more likely to show greater acti-\nvation in self-processing or value regions including vmPFC, whereas people\nfrom Asian cultures were more likely to show greater activation in mentalizing\nregions, including dmPFC and TPJ (Han and Ma 2014). Results demonstrated\nthat when making trait judgments either about the self or a friend, Chinese\nparticipants were more likely to recruit TPJ to make these judgments, whereas\nDanish participants were more likely to recruit vmPFC, and these cultural dif-\nferences were mediated by differences in interdependence (Ma et al. 2012).\nCultural differences in normative beliefs also influence how people behave\nwhen asked to donate to charities. People from East Asian cultures value bal-\nanced emotions over high arousal, highly positive emotions (Tsai 2007) and,\nas a result, are more likely to donate to recipients whose emotional expres-\nsion matches their cultural norms (Park et al. 2017). That is, East Asians trust\nand donate more money to charities represented by people with calm, balanced\nfacial expressions, whereas European Americans trust and donate more money\nto charities represented by people with excited facial expressions (Park et al.\n2017). The researchers further found that increased trust for people express-\ning culturally sanctioned emotions led to a stronger value signal but reduced\nmentalizing and ultimately greater likelihood of donating. Specifically, cultural\ndifferences in donations were linked to differences in brain activation in VS,\nPCC, and TPJ (Park et al. 2017). TPJ activation was negatively correlated with\nthe fit between an individual\u2019s cultural beliefs about what emotions are valued,\nand individuals were more likely to donate to charities that elicited greater VS\nactivation but weaker PCC and TPJ activations (Park et al. 2017).\nLastly, socioeconomic factors such as parents\u2019 educational status strongly\ninfluence how individuals perceive choice options (Stephens et al. 2007)\nand their motivation to influence vs. adjust to their environment (Savani\net al. 2008). As described above, activation in social pain and mentalizing\nregions when individuals are excluded from a group was associated with how\nsusceptible individuals were to peer influence in a driving simulation weeks\nlater (Falk et al. 2014); however, this effect was moderated by SES: adolescents\nfrom lower SES backgrounds showed a stronger relationship between social\npain regions and susceptibility to peer influence, whereas individuals fromDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This work suggests that how individuals respond to and manage\nnegative affective reactions to exclusion differs as a function of SES, and\nactivation in social pain regions might actually promote susceptibility to peer\ninfluence.\nTaken together, these three lines of research on moderating roles of social\nnetworks, culture, and SES show that the relationship between brain activation\nand behavior is context dependent. In order to accurately predict behavior, it\nis therefore important to consider biological factors such as brain activation\nas well as sociocultural factors such social networks, culture, or SES. However,\nnone of these studies have considered how multiple sociocultural factors might\ninteract. Future research could examine whether social network composition\nmight buffer against the effects of SES on neural responses to social exclusion or\ninvestigate if differences in cultural values modulate the relationship between\nsocial network position and behavior.\nFuture Directions\nAcross the research highlighted in this review, results demonstrate that\nincorporating measures of brain activation improves our ability to predict\nhuman behavior at both the individual and group levels. Furthermore, the\nspecific brain regions and network connectivity patterns provide insight into\nthe psychological processes underlying social behaviors such as persuasion,\npeer influence, and information sharing. Critically, these associations were\nidentified between brain activation and real-world behaviors, indicating the\nutility of laboratory research to capture behavioral variability within our daily\nlives; however, there is still progress and advances to be made in the experi-\nmental paradigms employed to better capture the richness and complexity of\nreal-world behaviors and social interactions.\nThe majority of the research reviewed here utilized fMRI where participants\nlie on their backs in a scanner with minimal head and body movement,\nresponding to isolated stimuli presented on a single computer monitor. While\nthis environment is designed for studying specific cognitive processes, without\nexcessive noise overriding the physiological signal of interest or confounds\nof concurrent tasks, the laboratory may not fully capture how tasks are\nperformed in the real world, where our bodies and eyes move freely while\nwe perform multiple, concurrent tasks (Vettel et al. 2012). Even in laboratory\nsettings, complex, naturalistic stimuli elicit different patterns of activation and\ninterregional connectivity compared with more controlled, experimentally\nmanipulated stimuli (Hasson et al. 2010). This complements additional studies\nthat have also identified performance differences when tasks are embeddedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For example, in many studies on social\nexclusion and peer influence, participants never actually meet their interaction\npartners. Mobile neuroimaging makes it possible to measure brain activation\nwhile individuals are navigating complex social dynamics, which can provide\nfurther insight into how individuals behave in naturalistic social interactions.\nFor instance, the degree to which students in a classroom have brain patterns\nthat are in sync with one another predicts classroom engagement and social\ndynamics, suggesting that shared attention in group settings is a potentially\nimportant feature of successful teaching (Dikker et al. 2017). Ongoing work\nin our laboratories examines how dyadic communication is influenced by the\nreal-world risk of driving along the interstate while a passenger communicates\nstories to the driver (Vettel et al. 2018). Likewise, tools from computational\nsocial science (e.g. social network analysis, computational linguistic methods,\ngeolocation tracking) are rapidly making it more possible to integrate large\namounts of information about an individual\u2019s specific social environment into\nmodels of brain\u2013behavior relationships.\nIn addition to considering how new tools (such as mobile neuroimaging)\nmight enable researchers to better model brain\u2013behavior relationships, it is\nalso important to consider how this knowledge might be applied to influence\nor inform how individuals behave. In other cases, this work might be help-\nful in understanding how to increase more personal resilience to deception or\nmanipulation. The studies described above reveal a few key insights. First, neu-\nroimaging research can help identify which messages or techniques are most\nlikely to be effective in influencing behavior (e.g. Falk et al. 2015b). Second,\nneuroimaging research can help identify which individuals are more or less\nsusceptible to influence (e.g. Wasylyshyn et al. 2018). However, the third, and\nmost important, insight is that these studies indicate that brain connectivity is\nshaped by, and malleable to, environmental factors. Contextual factors such as\nsocial networks (e.g. Pegors et al. 2017) and short-term shift in mind-set (e.g.\nFalk et al. 2015a) can influence the brain\u2013behavior relationship, including how\npeople respond to persuasive appeals. Thus, while neuroimaging research can\npotentially identify which individuals will be more likely to change their behav-\niors, it is also possible to use neuroimaging to identify how and when persuasive\nappeals are more or less effective.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In many cases, brain activation provides\ninformation that predicts behavior with an accuracy that is above and beyond\nthat obtained from self-report measures of attitudes, preferences, or intentions\n(Venkatraman et al. 2015; Falk et al. 2015b; Genevsky et al. 2017).\nAcross these diverse domains, brain regions involved in social and reward\nprocessing are frequently associated with behavior, suggesting that brain\nactivation might be providing insight into how people process information\nabout the reward value of various options or outcomes as well as how they\nconsider the perspective and mental states of others. In particular, vmPFC\nand VS are most often associated with behavior in domains where behaviors\nare primarily self-focused (e.g. health behavior change, consumer choices). By\ncontrast, dmPFC and TPJ are more often implicated in domains where others\u2019\nthoughts and opinions are relevant (e.g. information sharing, social influence,\nand exclusion).\nMoreover, the association between brain activation and individual and group\nbehavior is context dependent. Social factors including social network posi-\ntion, culture, and SES influence individuals\u2019 beliefs, values, and goals (Markus\nand Kitayama 1991; Visser and Mirabile 2004; Stephens et al. 2014), which\nin turn influence how they make decisions (Perry-Smith and Shalley 2003;\nStephens et al. 2007; Riemer et al. 2014), interact with close and distant others\n(Xie et al. 1999; Wagner et al. 2012), and process persuasive messages (Uskul\nand Oyserman 2010; van Noort et al. 2012). These effects of social context\nare then reflected in the relationship between brain activation and behavior.\nThe extent to which social and reward-related brain regions are linked to\nindividual behavior is influenced by social network position (O\u2019Donnell et al.\n2017; Pegors et al. 2017), culture (Tompson et al. 2015; Park et al. 2017), and\nSES (Muscatell et al. 2012; Cascio et al. 2017).\nRecent advances in multivariate approaches for analyzing brain data can\nalso improve our ability to predict behavior and provide additional insight into\nthe psychological processes mediating this effect. MVPA and RSA provide\ninsight into how individual brain regions encode information about behavioral\noptions (Kriegeskorte 2011), whereas network approaches provide insight into\nhow brain regions work together to evaluate information about the behavioral\noptions (Bassett and Sporns 2017).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These\nmethods provide novel insights into how individuals behave in a social world\nand will serve as useful tools for researchers aiming to understand and predict\nhuman behavior.\nReferences\nAdolphs, R.

Pavlic\nSchool of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering and the School of Sustainability,\nArizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA\nIt is natural to eschew consideration of the nonhuman world when seeking\nunderstanding of the complex social-behavioral landscape of human phe-\nnomena. Humans build cities, form governments, make laws, write poetry,\nand make decisions that are evidently products of deliberate, long-term\nplanning \u2013 all things that seem to be absent from most of the nonhuman\nworld. Anthropologists sometimes look to nonhuman primates for insights\ninto human social behavior because they are a closely related out-group that\ncan be used as a reference for understanding the evolutionary trajectory of\nhominids. Despite the use of the idiom \u201cthe birds and the bees\u201d as a euphemism\nfor an important human social behavior, the use of birds and bees and other\nnonhuman organisms is almost entirely restricted to cases where there is\nhigh correspondence between physiological mechanisms under study. An ant\ncolony seems to be a poor model for a human society because it lacks realistic\ndetail and scaling, and so any analogy between ant colonies and human groups\nis largely thought to be \u201cfor the birds.\u201d\nHowever, experienced quantitative modelers recognize that models live\non a continuum \u2013 from analogous to metaphorical \u2013 and are defined by\nhow they are used and not what they are made of. Box (1979) is well known\nfor the aphorism that \u201call models are wrong but some are useful,\u201d which\nis meant to highlight both that no model can be a perfect representation\nof a system and that even the most imperfect representation of a system\ncan be insightful. Furthermore, to Box (1976), the utility of a model cannot\nbe evaluated a priori \u2013 \u201cwe cannot know that any statistical technique we\ndevelop is useful unless we use it.\u201d Physics has made great progress predicting\nthe macroscopic behavior of ensembles of particles using mathematical\nand computational models that make microscopic assumptions about those\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Models are a means to end; they are\ntools on which theories are built, and theories are tools used to deepen the\nshallows of explanatory abilities (Wilson and Keil 1998) through an iterative\nprocess of conceptual exploration and experimentation.\nThus, the differences between complex human societies and complex\nsocieties of ants and birds are important to recognize but should not be viewed\nas weaknesses offhand; these animal systems may still be mined, with caution,\nfor transferable insights. In fact, just as a simple, smoothly varying differential\nequation may be an attractive model for a population of discrete individuals,\nthe empirical tractability that might be gained by working with nonhuman\nsystems could compensate for losses in realism. Furthermore, given that the\nwide variety of nonhuman social systems is accompanied by a wide range of\ndiffering social behaviors, methods and perspectives developed to understand\nnonhuman behavioral ecology in a unified evolutionary and developmental\ncontext may themselves be valuable when considering avenues for exploring\ncomplex human social behavior.\nThis chapter explores several motivational examples for how nonhuman\nsystems can contribute to the study of complexity in human societies. The\ndiscussion is divided into three main parts: (i) emergent social patterns in\nself-interested individuals, (ii) the effect of competition between groups, and\n(iii) how information is used within tightly integrated groups. As the examples\nmove the focus from low integration to high integration, the animal models\nmove from vertebrate systems \u2013 primarily social foraging birds \u2013 to arthropod\nsystems, social spiders and ants. This chapter then concludes with some\ngeneral comments about the generalizability of studies with nonhuman social\nsystems when used as a model for human social systems.\nEmergent Patterns in Groups of Behaviorally Flexible\nIndividuals\nA particularly fruitful animal model for studying sociality in nonhuman\nsystems is the nutmeg mannikin (Figure 11.1), a dull-colored bird common\nto both the pet trade and behavioral ecology (Tinbergen 1951; Moynihan\nand Hall 1955; Restall 1997). These birds form natural groups that can vary\nin size but can be as large as 100, similar to estimates of early Pre-Pottery\nNeolithic human community sizes (Kuijt 2000). Like humans, their behaviors\nhave evolved against a background of living in potentially large groups within\nhabitats that vary in resource availability. Because there is natural temporal\nvariability in resources as well as group composition, selection has put pres-\nsure on these birds to flexibly and adaptively defend against as well as take\nadvantage of their social context for survival.

Early conceptual models of these scenarios took an\ninformation sharing perspective (Clark and Mangel 1984), whereby each group\nmember could simultaneously search for new patches while monitoring the\nsuccess of other members. The competing approach, first discussed by Barnard\nand Sibly (1981), assumes that individuals must balance their time between two\nmutually exclusive tactics \u2013 a producer tactic focused on the private search for\nnew patches and a scrounger tactic focused on the social task of monitoring\nothers. It is this latter perspective that has been successful in describing the\ngroup-level behaviors of nutmeg mannikins in social foraging tasks. Moreover,\nit also demonstrates how these individual-level trade-offs can lead to nontrivial\npatterns in large groups. Thus, the rest of this section focuses on the interplay\nof mathematics and controlled social foraging experiments in the service of\nbuilding confidence in exploitative conceptual models of social behavior.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

By observing groups of these birds in controlled settings\nin the laboratory, it is possible to study how each bird chooses a tactic. A\ncommon assay is to release a group of birds onto a large array of wells, some\nof which are empty and some of which contain seeds. Birds adopting the\nproducer tactic will pitch their beaks down toward the array and will have a\ntight correlation between the time they spend searching and the number of\nseed-filled wells they find (Coolen et al. 2001). However, birds adopting the\nscrounger tactic keep their heads upright and rarely make new discoveries of\nseed-filled wells; instead, scrounger foraging time is tightly correlated with\nnumber of seed-filled wells joined after a producer discovery of the well\n(Coolen et al. 2001; Wu and Giraldeau 2005). Putting aside differences in\nefficiency as a producer, the benefit to joining a group as a scrounger must\ndepend on the composition of producers and scroungers in the existing\ngroup. Despite the apparent benefits of being a parasitic scrounger, the\ntactic is a poor choice if a group consists of nearly all scroungers. Studying\nthe behavior of birds making these decisions led to the development of a\ngame-theoretic producer\u2013scrounger (PS) game that is general enough to\nmodel a wide range of other exploitative social phenomena in animal behavior\n(Barnard and Sibly 1981; Vickery et al. 1991; Giraldeau and Beauchamp\n1999; Giraldeau and Caraco 2000). In fact, the PS game has also been used\nto study human social behavior, including cultural learning (Kameda and\nNakanishi 2002; Mesoudi 2008), the evolution of leadership (King et al.\n2009), and the coevolution of technology with culture (Lehmann and Feld-\nman 2009). This important conceptual framework came about through the\nstudy of the social foraging behavior of birds, and it can be used as a tool\nfor translating insights from the study of bird social behavior to under-\nstanding patterns, either existing or possible, in analogous human social\nscenarios.\nGame-Theoretic Model of Frequency-Dependent Tactic Choice\nIn order to make predictions that could be tested in empirical studies of social\nforaging behavior in these birds, a simplified game-theoretic model was built\nthat captured the salient features of how group size and foraging returns were\nmodulated by tactic frequency. The basic 2-tactic PS game (Giraldeau and\nCaraco 2000) considers a group of G foragers, of which some fraction p are\nproducers and (1 \u2212 p) are scroungers.

In principle, there is a stable equilibrium fre-\nquency (SEF) p\u2217 of producers such that if p = p\u2217, then the two intake rates will\nbe equivalent, which ensures that there is no benefit for any individual to uni-\nlaterally change her chosen tactic.

(11.1) and (11.2) is to generate predic-\ntions consistent with the hypothesis that individual birds switch between two\nmutually exclusive tactics and modulate their use of those tactics based on\nfrequency-dependent rewards. Thus, the game-theoretic mathematical model\nis not being tested itself but is instead a logical tool used to test the more general\nidea that individual birds are sensitive to their individual reward rates in social\nscenarios and switch between distinct behaviors in accordance with those\nrates. The PS game is intentionally simplistic because it is intended to generate\npredictions that will be tested in tightly controlled laboratory environments\nfor which the PS game is an appropriate tool for predicting social foraging\nbehavior. In other words, the goal of the game-theoretic approach is not to\nbuild a detailed and accurate representation of a particular organism.

The\nmathematical model focuses on the salient features of the hypothesis, and the\nsubsequent experiment carefully controls the model system so that important\ndetails are in focus through the lens of the mathematical model.\nConsistent with the hypothesis that birds switch between two mutually\nexclusive search modes based on their individual intake rates, the PS game\naccurately predicts the equilibrium frequency of producers in controlled\nlaboratory experiments with nutmeg mannikins. In particular, by observing\ngroups of a fixed size G foraging on patches of a fixed size F, the finder\u2019s\nadvantage a (or, more importantly, finder\u2019s share a\u2215F) can be estimated, and\nthe SEF p\u2217 can be predicted. For example, Giraldeau and Livoreil (1998) show\nthat experimentally manipulating the finder\u2019s share generated shifts in the\nfrequency of scrounging that match shifts consistent with a PS game. Similar\nPS-consistent shifts in scrounging frequency were observed by Coolen (2002)\nfor different group sizes. To move beyond these qualitative matches, Mottley\nand Giraldeau (2000) were able to design an apparatus that could precisely\ncontrol the finder\u2019s share and even force birds constrained to certain parts\nof the apparatus to only use one of the two tactics. This apparatus could also\nchange these precisely controlled intake rates in the middle of an experiment\nin order to test how quickly birds can adjust to the change. Social groups\ntested on the apparatus not only converged on the predicted SEF values, but\nthey also could converge on a new SEF value in one or two days after the\napparatus had been reconfigured for the new intake rates. Thus, the birds have\nsome mechanism that allows them to respond to changes in intake rate and\nstrategically adjust their individual tactics to maximize their individual returns\nsubject to the social foraging context.\nThe precise form of Eq. (11.2) depends upon the simplistic intake rates\nexpressed by Eq. (11.1) that are only justified in tightly controlled social for-\naging experiments in the laboratory. However, the hypothesis being tested by\nthose experiments is far more general. Having accumulated confidence in that\nhypothesis under tightly controlled settings, it is then possible to extrapolate\nto more general social scenarios without simplistic mathematical models.\nIn other words, the simplistic mathematical model and tightly controlled\nlaboratory setup were not meant to be direct surrogates for complex social\nbehavior but rather simple tests to characterize the feasibility of an underlying\nconceptual model. The outcomes of those experiments are consistent with the\nhypothesis that birds are sensitive at an individual level to the cost of each\ntactic. Consequently, even though tactic-specific costs are not captured by\nEq. (11.1), qualitative predictions about increases in the cost of one strategy\nover the other can be made and tested in experiments. For nutmeg mannikins,\nthe cost of producing can be adjusted in the laboratory by weighing down lids\nthat cap food patches (Giraldeau et al. 1994), and such a manipulation reduces\nthe frequency of producers observed in groups, as would be expected.

Thus, although a precise model\npredicting the SEF for the case of asymmetric costs was not developed, the\nintuition imported from the more simplistic case was valuable and helped\nto build more confidence in a general model of how stable patterns at the\npopulation level are driven by individuals making locally optimal decisions\nwithin their social context.\nSynthesizing all of these observations together suggests that heterogeneity in\nproducer and scrounger performance may lead to consistent tactical patterns\nin natural flocks. In particular, if each bird has a different intrinsic efficiency at\nproducing and scrounging and can flexibly respond to its intake rate, then each\nbird may have a predictable choice of tactic use for each particular combina-\ntion of flockmates it is placed with. This consistency may appear to be a kind\nof personality, but it is instead an adaptive response to the heterogeneity in\nthe surrounding flockmates. To test this idea, Morand-Ferron et al. (2011) fol-\nlowed individual nutmeg mannikins within social foraging tasks and observed\nwhether (i) there were persistent individual-specific strategies of tactic use and\n(ii) these strategies were a function of the group composition. In fact, individ-\nuals observed in socially foraging groups would adopt the same PS strategies\nin the same groups even after being separated for as much as six months; how-\never, individuals would adopt new strategies when placed in novel groups. Thus,\napparent idiosyncratic preference for certain tactics emerges naturally out of\nheterogeneity and sensitivity to local rewards and can be completely erased by\neven minor changes in group composition.\nTransferable Insights from Behavioral Games to Human Groups\nIn human groups, such as faculty meetings, there may be anecdotal evidence\nthat certain individuals always seem to emerge as a strong leader when in\nsome groups but are almost invisible in other groups. To try to explain this\nphenomenon, complex models specially tuned to human uniqueness could be\nbuilt. Those models might incorporate proxies for emotion, anxiety, memory,\npersonality, or other highly cognitive processes assumed to play a role in\nall human decision-making. Psychologists and management scientists have\ndeveloped statistical methods, such as structural equation models (Bagozzi\nand Yi 2012), for formally building systems of latent variables up from an\nintrospective approach to human behavior. For example, the technology\nacceptance model (TAM) (e.g., Davis 1989; Davis et al. 1989) explains the\nadoption of new technologies in terms of latent variables like attitude and\nsubjective norm and intention. Attempting to apply the same models to other\nanimal systems would likely be ill-advised because it would be suspicious to\nassume that attitude, intention, and subjective norm had meaning outsideDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, despite these latent variables being meaningless in\nanimal groups that at least superficially seem to produce similar patterns of\nbehavior, they are often deemed necessary for the analysis of human behavior.\nIn fact, computational simulation studies of human behavior even insert some\nmechanistic approximation of emotional dynamics without any understanding\nof the actual mechanisms that give rise to the personal experience of emotion\n(Popescu et al. 2013; Belhaj et al. 2014; Fan et al. 2018).\nAlthough models derived from introspection may be viewed as superior to\nother models because they incorporate variables that are otherwise impossi-\nble to observe, the introspective gambit comes with much risk without much\nreward. Measurements of brain activity have shown that outcomes of human\ndecisions are encoded in the brain as much as 10 seconds before a subject\nbecomes aware of the decision (Soon et al. 2008), which may suggest that the\nintrospective experience of a human is actually a side effect of more funda-\nmental processes likely to be shared with other animals. Even if aspects of the\nconscious experience do play a significant role in explaining human behavior,\nlittle is known about the underlying mechanisms that give rise to phenomena\nsuch as emotion. Consider a computational model of human agents built using\nsome numerical approximation of emotion and other relevant factors. Sim-\nulations of these numerical humans (n-humans) might reveal that individual\nassertion of leadership is a function of the surrounding group. However, the\ninsights gained from such an n-human simulation will be inextricably linked to\npoor approximations of underlying mechanisms that are inferred to exist purely\nbased on introspective experience of the modeler and not on objective opera-\ntional descriptions. A more conservative approach is to approach the analysis of\nhuman behavior as in the analysis of the behavior of any other organism \u2013 based\nonly on observations made by an objective, third-party observer.\nJust as mathematical models can be used to give insight into the social\nbehaviors of flocks of birds, birds themselves can be viewed as conceptual\nmodels for understanding social behavior in less tractable social groups, such\nas human social groups. Although there are significant differences between\nnutmeg mannikins and humans, groups of these birds searching a shared\nspace for limited resources face social problems analogous to those seen in\nhuman groups. Consequently, studying how the birds naturally solve these\nproblems provides perspective not only on the birds but also on the structure\nof the problem itself. The birds are just as arbitrary of a model system as\nan n-human simulation, but the bird behaviors have been shaped by similar\nselective pressures as human behaviors, and thus it is more reasonable to\nassume congruence between the bird behaviors and human society than\nthe computational behaviors and human society. Properly using birds in\nthis way takes great care, but good computational modeling should also\nbe done carefully.

With great control allows\nfor the application of mathematical methods that provide even more insight\ninto the underlying processes. By iterating between laboratory experiments\nand mathematical modeling, more sophisticated conceptual models of social\nbehavior can be built. In the case of the nutmeg mannikins, this iterative\nprocess led to a conceptual model that could explain the emergence of\ngroup-composition-dependent individual tactics. This perspective could also\nbe used to understand the emergence of different roles in human groups where\npositive and negative rewards are frequency dependent. In fact, the PS game\nand related insights from social foraging theory have already been applied\nto human cases (e.g. Kameda and Nakanishi 2002; Mesoudi 2008; King et al.\n2009; Lehmann and Feldman 2009), which demonstrates the generality of this\napproach.\nModel Systems for Understanding Group Competition\nThe behaviorally stable strategies discussed for the nutmeg mannikins take\nplace on short time scales and help to ensure that every individual receives\nthe same direct benefits as all other individuals. It is not the case that birds in\nthe scrounger role are cheating and receiving more direct benefits than birds\nin an altruistic producer role. No bird can receive higher direct benefits by\nchoosing a different tactic, and all patterns that are idiosyncratic to the group\nare epiphenomena that emerge from inter-individual competition and have\nno group-level adaptive value on their own. Moreover, if one individual is\nadded or replaces another, the previously consistent mixture of strategies may\ncompletely change.\nIn a human business organization, individuals may similarly self-sort into\nbehavioral roles based on individual benefit, and those assortments may be\nsimilarly fragile when individuals are added, removed, or changed. However,\nthe particular mixture of roles may not be optimal in terms of the organization\u2019s\nproductivity output as a whole. In the case of a monopoly, suboptimal perfor-\nmance of the organization may be frustrating to its leadership but is unlikely\nto lead to the downfall of the company. However, when multiple companies\ncompete with each other and consist of relatively immobile employees, the\nincentives of each employee are more tightly correlated with the output of\ntheir employer. Thus, tight competition among groups can shift an individual\u2019s\nstrategic focus toward behavioral tactics that may appear to be altruistic but\nare actually entirely consistent with the self-interest of the individual. Such\nshifts in individual focus can occur at an evolutionary time scale in nonhuman\nanimal social systems as well.

In their\nframework, the high levels of intergroup competition lead to an emergence\nof superorganismic groups that truly do have group-level properties that give\nrise to group-level performance. In this section, two related examples are\npresented \u2013 one from social spiders and the other from ants \u2013 that demonstrate\nhow natural selection acting on group-level productivity can lead to different\nmixtures of individuals within those groups.\nSocial Spiders as Model Systems for Understanding Personality\nin Groups\nA particularly striking natural example of emergent group-level properties\ncomes from the socially polymorphic cobweb spider Anelosimus studiosus\n(Figure 11.2). These spiders live exclusively in large groups of related indi-\nviduals. Unlike social insects, these spiders have no strict division of labor;\neach female could potentially lay eggs that develop to maturity. However,\nmembers of the colony do assist each other in prey capture, parental care, and\nweb maintenance. In these spiders, each individual can be grouped into one\nof two behavioral types \u2013 docile and aggressive \u2013 that each correspond to a\nsyndrome of consistent variations across a wide range of behavioral contexts\n(a) (b)\nFigure 11.2 The social cobweb spider, Anelosimus studiosus.

Individual spiders, as in (a), form large colonies, as in (b), of related\nindividuals that assist each other in prey capture, parental care, and web maintenance. Each\ncolony contains a mix of two distinct behavioral phenotypes, docile and aggressive, and the\nparticular docile-to-aggressive ratio for a colony not only has fitness effects on colony\nreproduction but also is heritable from mother colony to daughter colony.

In other words,\nthe behavioral type alone is a strong predictor of several behavioral traits\nsimultaneously. These behavioral syndromes are analogous to personalities\nin humans \u2013 knowing that someone has an aggressive personality allows for\ngood predictions of responses in a wide range of behavioral contexts. Likewise,\nspider personalities can be determined in laboratory assays by scoring spiders\nin a range of behavioral tests over different contexts (Pruitt et al. 2008). Fur-\nthermore, the docile\u2013aggressive behavioral type of a spider is heritable \u2013 the\ndeviation in offspring behavioral type from the population mean is 32% of the\ndeviation of the parents\u2019 behavioral types from the population mean (Pruitt\nand Riechert 2009b). In other words, the offspring of two aggressive parents\nwill be more likely to be aggressive itself than would otherwise be predicted by\nthe natural variation in behavioral types. Natural colonies contain nontrivial\nmixtures of docile and aggressive individuals, and there is high variation\nacross colonies in the within-group composition of different behavioral types.\nAdditionally, spider groups of an artificially determined size and personality\nmixture can be generated and studied in the lab or transplanted back into a\nnatural field habitat for observation (Pruitt and Riechert 2009a). Together, the\ntractability of determining a personality of an individual spider and the ability\nto create colonies of artificial size and personality composition make these\nspiders ideal model systems for studying the effect of different personality\nmixtures on group performance.\nTo say that groups are in competition means that there is some intrinsic\ngroup-level property that:\n\u2022 Varies among groups.\n\u2022 Is inherited, to some extent, from a parent group to offspring groups.\n\u2022 Leads some groups to have more group progeny than other groups.\nIn fact, these are the same properties that are necessary for natural selection\nto act on an individual-level trait. Showing that a system exhibits these three\nproperties at the level of a natural group has historically been very difficult\nuntil a carefully designed study by Pruitt and Goodnight (2014) on A. studiosus\nsocial spiders. In the study, spiders were collected from several different sites\nthat could broadly be put into two groups \u2013 high and low resource availabil-\nity \u2013 under the assumption that the different group conditions would put dif-\nferent selective pressures on colonies. The docile-to-aggressive ratio was mea-\nsured in natural colonies from each site to determine the local mixture, and\nthen colonies with artificial docile-to-aggressive mixtures were generated in\nthe laboratory and transplanted either into the native site or into a foreign site\nthat differed in resource availability. Pruitt and Goodnight (2014) then mea-\nsured the reproductive output of each of the released groups (i.e. the number\nof offspring colonies produced) as well as the docile-to-aggressive composition\nof the released groups two generations after release.

However, the third\nresult shows that the docile-to-aggressive ratio is truly a group-level trait that\nis maintained by the group independent of the environment. Thus, the person-\nality mixtures emerge from processes intrinsic to the group, and groups with\ndifferent personality mixtures compete with each other to determine which\ngroups proliferate over time. Exactly why certain personality mixtures are well\nsuited for particular sites is not understood and a potentially interesting future\nresearch direction.\nAnts as Model Systems for Understanding the Costs and Benefits\nof Specialization\nThe fact that certain behavioral mixtures of social spider groups were shown\nto be advantageous in certain habitats suggests that personality mixtures may\ncorrespond to certain divisions of labor. Aggressive spiders, for example, may\nbe specialists on nest defense and prey capture, whereas docile spiders may\nbe specialists on brood care. A colony needs both, but the right mixture may\nvary depending on the demands put on each colony. Whereas social spiders\nare a good model system to study the costs and benefits of different mixtures of\nspecializations, other animal model systems are well suited to study the value of\nspecialization itself. One such example studied by Jongepier and Foitzik (2016)\nis the system of Temnothorax longispinosus acorn ants and their social parasite\nTemnothorax americanus.\nTemnothorax longispinosus is a small ant with colonies that reside in indi-\nvidual acorns in nature but can be readily transplanted into artificial laboratory\nnests. Because the colonies are so small and the tempo of the ants so slow, every\nindividual within the nest can be observed simultaneously, which makes them\nideal for studying division of labor. In some areas, these ants share their habitat\nwith the social parasite T. americanus, which has lost the ability to raise work-\ners that care for its own brood.

Alternatively, recently mated\nqueens of T. americanus can invade a functioning colony of T. longispinosus and kill all\nworkers, effectively stealing all brood as well as the cavity of the host T. americanus colony.\nSource: The image in (a) is by April Nobile from www.AntWeb.com and provided under a\nCC-BY 4.0 (Creative Commons 2018d) license.

These raids are potentially fatal to an appreciable num-\nber of ants from the host colony being raided. Queens of both of these ants are\nshown in Figure 11.3, where the T. americanus queen in Figure 11.3b is shown\nwith worker slaves of yet another Temnothorax species.\nAt least since Smith (1776), specialization has been held up as an enormous\nbenefit to functioning societies because it minimizes the costs of task switching.\nNevertheless, real societies are rarely free of generalists and usually have levels\nof specialization far less than what is theoretically possible. One possible expla-\nnation for the relatively low level of specialization in society is that develop-\nmental constraints prevent the realization of maximally specialized mixtures.\nAlternatively, there may be costs to specialization, and the intermediate level\nof task specialization reflects a balance of its costs and benefits. It is this latter\nhypothesis that Jongepier and Foitzik (2016) tested using T. longispinosus as a\nmodel system.\nIn ant colonies, there are a wide variety of task types that must be completed\nby workers.

They then created subsets of ant colonies with artificially\ndefined compositions of specialists and generalists. By subjecting these colony\nfragments to raids, they could use the number of brood saved by the end of the\nraid as a measure of the success of that particular mixture of specialists and\ngeneralists. Their results showed clearly that colonies composed of generalists\nsaved more brood than those composed of specialists. Effectively, colonies with\ngeneralists could continuously perform both tasks even after a large number\nof host ants were lost as casualties of the conflict. In specialist colonies, one\ntask type could be completely lost during the raid. Moreover, to confirm\nthat this result was not a laboratory artifact, they sampled the actual level of\nspecialization in natural colonies in areas with and without T. americanus\nraiding ants present. Those colonies in areas without T. americanus showed\nhigh levels of specialization, whereas those colonies in areas with raiding\nants had more generalists, which is consistent with their laboratory results. A\ncolony with more specialists is less resilient to raids, but this resilience cost is\nmodulated by how likely a colony is to be raided. Thus, although specialization\nis advantageous in some contexts, it may be disadvantageous in others.\nPersonality and Specialization: From Nonhuman to Human Groups\nIn the first section, the nutmeg mannikins were used as a model of how the\nintroduction of a novel individual in a group could lead to widespread behav-\nioral changes in all others in the group. Thus, any properties that are appar-\nently idiosyncratic to the group are actually emergent properties from the inter-\naction among the group members and their environment. However, for the\nsocial spiders from the second section, groups truly do have their own sepa-\nrate sets of properties, and those properties can have causal influence on which\nmember compositions persist or are lost in the meta-population of groups.\nWhereas it was more parsimonious to discuss the individual-level costs and\nbenefits in the case of nutmeg mannikins, it is more parsimonious to discuss\ngroup-level costs and benefits in social spiders. The social spiders provide a\nconceptual model for considering how personality mixture effects the perfor-\nmance of a group.

Projecting onto human cases,\norganizations wishing to alter their personality mixture (e.g. to shift away from\na workforce dominated by aggressive individuals) may need to do much more\nthan simply adjust the mixture of personality types within the organization or\nelse the original group composition will return, possibly at the detriment of\nthe group performance. For example, the \u201ccultural DNA\u201d of the organization\nor other factors favoring the retention of aggressive individuals and encourag-\ning the attrition of docile individuals may also need to be changed to ensure\nlong-lasting changes in group dynamics.\nJust as human organizations often have staff that are cross-trained on\nmultiple tasks, ant groups like the ones described above often include mix-\ntures of specialists and generalists. Cross-training is often viewed from the\nperspective of maximizing the utilization of human resources \u2013 harvesting\nidle time from the cross-trained group of generalists to better respond to\nsudden bursts of demand for one task type or another. However, the ant\nmodel shows that generalists also buffer against catastrophic events, and the\ngeneralist-to-specialist ratio is effectively a sliding scale of resilience. Having a\nsingle specialist for each task type means having a single point of failure; the\nsystem depends on every individual being present and working without error.\nIf conditions exist that remove individuals from the workforce or introduce\nfaults, highly specialized groups will not be able to recover. Furthermore, in\nthe utopian, hyper-specialized vision of Smith (1776), a highly efficient society\nwould also be very fragile. Consequently, natural ant colonies that are highly\nspecialized coincide with fail-safe areas where raiding is very unlikely, and\nnaturally occurring ant colonies with appreciable numbers of generalists are\nsafe to fail and are thus resilient to periodic invasions or other dislocations of\nthe workforce.\nBoth of these examples examined group-level performance in a sequence of\nsteps starting with careful laboratory observations of individuals and building\nup to observations of real groups in nature. Each layer of investigation was\ninformed by conceptual developments and tools developed in the layer before\nit. Furthermore, mathematical models linking individual performance to group\nperformance like the game-theoretic approach of Reeve and H\u00f6lldobler (2007)\nprovide a unifying perspective for comparing and contrasting the evolution-\nary pressures that ultimately shaped these complex societies. Colonies of cob-\nweb spiders or acorn ants may seem unrelated to human groups, but they are\nsufficiently rich examples of complex sociality that they can reveal general prin-\nciples that transcend taxonomic boundaries. Furthermore, in the sequence of\nsteps leading up to understanding a complex human social phenomenon, natu-\nral models even as phylogenetically distant as arthropods can still have value at\nintermediate stages of the sequence.

In reality, careful laboratory and\nfield observations of animal social systems can be complementary to mathe-\nmatical and computational methods meant to directly capture human-specific\nbehaviors. Just as in the case of T. longispinosus ants, specializing on a single\nmodeling method may increase the efficiency of the research community, but\nit will necessarily decrease its resilience.\nInformation Dynamics in Tightly Integrated Groups\nPatterns of group composition are one of the most conspicuous features of\nsocial groups; however, they may also be one of the most superficial. A tightly\nintegrated group has individuals that share information so as to coordinate\ncollective actions. It may seem natural to use large, social vertebrates as mod-\nels for coordination and information processing in human systems; however,\nmost information processing work in the social vertebrate literature (e.g. Hare\nand Tomasello 2005; Greenberg et al. 2010; Plotnik et al. 2011; Sasaki and Biro\n2017) attempts to measure the similarity between those systems and humans as\nopposed to discovering new insights for further human studies. Furthermore,\nthose animal models often involve small groups \u2013 not the kind of large-scale\ninformation processing that might characterize teams, companies, cities, and\nsocieties. One exception is the study of collective motion, as in the study of fish\nschools that collectively escape the attacks of predators (Handegard et al. 2012).\nHowever, just as it was described for nutmeg mannikins, fish in these schools\nare not truly sharing information so much as exploiting available information\nfrom fish around them. Coordination, information integration, and delibera-\ntion is not well represented in studies of these vertebrate groups.\nAlternatively, organismal biologists have studied collective decision-making\nin a wide range of social-insect systems without explicit reference to human\ndecision-making (e.g. Camazine et al. 1999; Detrain et al. 1999; Franks et al.\n2002; Kulahci et al. 2008). Because of strongly aligned interests among insects\nin a social-insect colony, natural selection has generated truly coordinated\nbehaviors \u2013 where the actions of groups of individuals are mutually beneficial\nto all in the group \u2013 as opposed to purely exploitative behaviors between\nindividuals, where the actions of individuals are pragmatic responses to the\nactions of others. For example, a worker ant is physiologically constrained so\nthat she has little-to-no opportunity to produce her own offspring, and so it\nis in her best interests to join with her similarly constrained sisters to raise\nthe brood of their mother, who does have the ability to produce offspring.\nThus, the competition between two ant colonies is effectively the competition\nbetween queens; the workers are so tightly integrated into the queen\u2019s interests\nthat they may be viewed as her extended phenotype.

So eusocial insects are\nmacroscopic systems with integration rivaling that of the integration between\nmicroscopic components of a monolithic organism.\nFurthermore, because similar collective decision-making challenges have\nbeen solved in different ways across different insect taxa, the social insects\nare a natural comparative laboratory for understanding how different infor-\nmation processing mechanisms are matched to different contexts. Thus,\nthese social-insect systems can be useful models for understanding effective\ninformation processing in large groups under significant communication con-\nstraints. The wide range of information processing examples in social insects\ncan serve as inspiration for the development of novel decision support systems\nto improve decision-making in large human socio-technological systems where\ntight integration and high group-level performance is desired. This section\ndescribes several examples of how different tactics for sharing information\namong individuals lead to important differences in collective decision-making\nin ants. For more details on the connections between crowd-sourced human\ncomputation and a wide range of social insects (including examples from ants,\nbees, and wasps), see the extensive review by Pavlic and Pratt (2013).\nLinear and Nonlinear Recruitment Dynamics\nCollective decision-making in ant colonies often requires each ant to recruit\nothers to new opportunities she discovers, such as a new food source. As\ndiscussed above, ant colonies are eusocial, which implies that it is in each\nworker\u2019s best interests to increase the productivity of her mother queen.\nSo the sharing of information is not altruistic, nor is it exploitative; it is\nmutually beneficial to all in the colony. Much of the earliest work on collective\ndecision-making by ants studied recruitment during group foraging in the\nblack garden ant, Lasius niger (Figure 11.4). When an L. niger worker finds a\nfood source, she can recruit other workers to that food source by depositing\na chemical pheromone trail between the food source and the home nest.\nWorkers that would otherwise be waiting at the nest or searching randomly\nthrough the environment will preferentially follow that trail and, after finding\nthe corresponding food source, can reinforce the trail with additional chemical\ndeposition. Unreinforced, the chemical trail will evaporate, and foragers\nwill return to a random search pattern. However, if the trail attracts enough\nrecruits to reinforce it at a rate faster than the evaporation rate, it will persist\nand even grow in its attractiveness. In Figure 11.5, hypothetical relationships\nbetween the strength of the trail (i.e. how many ants are committed to theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Mathematical models (Sumpter and Beekman 2003) suggest that\nif the shape of this curve has an accelerating portion, as in the solid line in\nFigure 11.5, the foraging ants will come to consensus on a single site. That is,\nso-called nonlinear recruitment will lead to random search being abandoned,\nand all ants will be concentrated on a single trail that is sustained by their\ncontinuous reinforcement. Furthermore, laboratory experiments with L niger\nconfirm that their trail-laying dynamics do lead colonies to come to consensus\non a single foraging site (Beckers et al. 1990, 1993).\nAlthough the chemical communication between trail-laying ants like L. niger\nmay seem foreign compared to modes of human communication, similar\nforms of emergent consensus building exist in human socio-technological\nsystems. For example, humans engaged in online commerce may be given the\nopportunity to leave publicly accessible reviews on purchased products. The\ncumulative record of reviews for a product is not unlike the accumulation of\npheromones for a particular food source. A product with a few reviews may\nnot attract much more attention than a product with no reviews. However,\nonce a product reaches some threshold level of reviews, it can dominate the\nattention of na\u00efve consumers. Even the notion of ratings (e.g. 4 out of 5 stars)\nhas an analog in trail-laying ants because ants can deposit different amounts\nof pheromone based on the perceived quality of the food source. So just as\nnonlinear recruitment is expected to drive trail-laying ants to consensus on a\nsingle option, the persistent review record on online commerce sites combined\nwith human psychology can lead to an apparent consensus on a single product.\nThus, studying the accuracy and flexibility of such recruitment systems in ants\ncan also shed light on important scenarios for analogous human information\naggregation systems.\nHerd Behavior and Information Cascades in Ants\nContinuing the analogy with human markets, the recruitment process\ndescribed for L. niger is formally similar to sequential decision models\ndeveloped by economists to understand herd behavior in human markets\n(Banerjee 1992; Bikhchandani et al. 1992; Welch 1992). In those economic\nmodels, the transition from private information to social information led to\na reduction in system flexibility and a risk of an information cascade where\nconsumers would ignore novel, potentially better products if those products\narrived too late in the process. Despite the term herd behavior having obvious\nconnections to nonhuman biology, early economists studying sequential\nmodels of human markets were apparently unaware of much of the work in\nsocial-insect studies. Bikhchandani et al. (1992) do review examples from\nthe vertebrate literature and even note that it may be advantageous to study\nzoological examples because animals are less likely to engage in extended\ndiscourse and mass media campaigns that might affect individual decision\nmaking about alternative actions. In other words, Bikhchandani et al. (1992)Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

If they had recognized that vertebrate social systems\nexist that are both prone to cascades and immune to their effects, it may\nhave motivated more sophisticated economic models for understanding the\ncomplexities of human behavior.\nBeyond the vertebrate literature, it is unfortunate that early economists\nstudying herd behavior and information cascades were apparently unaware of\nwork in the invertebrate literature on similar problems. Beckers et al. (1990)\nstudied both L. niger and the pavement ant, Tetramorium immigrans (then\ncalled Tetramorium caespitum), in laboratory experiments where a low-quality\nfeeder was introduced long before a high-quality feeder. They show that\nL. niger fixates on the low-quality feeder and is unable to break the social\ninertia when the high-quality feeder is introduced; however, the pavement ant\nis able to detect the later-introduced high-quality feeder and reallocate for-\nagers to exploit both feeders simultaneously, with a greater proportion of ants\nallocated to the high-quality feeder, thus sacrificing consensus for flexibility.\nBeckers et al. (1990) also introduce a simple mathematical model that is able\nto reproduce both trajectories so long as L. niger is assumed to use purely\nnonlinear recruitment and the pavement ants are assumed to use a mixture of\nlinear and nonlinear recruitments. One possible explanation for the putative\nlinear portion of the pavement ant response is that pavement ants interact both\nwith an accumulating pheromone trail and directly with each other. However,\nmechanisms of direct ant-to-ant interaction in pavement ants were not well\nunderstood. However, direct ant-to-ant recruitment is observed in several\nspecies of ants in the genus Temnothorax, and any use of pheromone trails in\nthese ants is apparently limited to individual navigation as opposed to commu-\nnication (Maschwitz et al. 1986; M\u00f6glich et al. 1974; M\u00f6glich 1979; Pratt et al.\n2001; Franks and Richardson 2006; Franklin et al. 2011). Consequently, Shaffer\net al. (2013) were able to show that Temnothorax rugatulus allocate foragers\nto feeders in proportion to quality and are able to track changes in quality,\njust as would be predicted in the mathematical model of Beckers et al. (1990)\nwith purely linear recruitment. The distinction between linear and nonlinear\nrecruitment has become a fundamental component of modern models of\nsocial-insect recruitment dynamics (Nicolis and Deneubourg 1999; Detrain\nand Deneubourg 2008; Sumpter 2010).\nAlthough L. niger has historically been used as a typical model of recruitment\nby trail laying, more recent work has shown that many other trail-laying ants\ncan respond to changes in feeder quality (Latty and Beekman 2013) similar to\nthe pavement ants studied by Beckers et al. (1990). Furthermore, rather thanDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nInformation Dynamics in Tightly Integrated Groups 251\nassuming that these ants achieve their flexibility through linear recruitment\nmechanisms, Dussutour et al. (2009) introduced a modification of the classic\n(Beckers et al. 1990) model that uses entirely nonlinear recruitment combined\nwith some rate of individual ant errors. That is, rather than assuming that\nthere is some unknown ant-to-ant recruitment mechanism that cannot be\neasily observed, they assume that individual ants sometimes fail to choose\npaths of highest chemical concentration. The resulting failure rate makes it\npossible for ants to effectively reach consensus on one option while still being\nable to switch to a better option that is introduced later. Their model fits the\nrecruitment dynamics of Pheidole megacephala in laboratory experiments\nwhere feeders are made to change positions during the experiment and ants\nare observed making errors at decision points in the laboratory apparatus.\nThus, Dussutour et al. (2009) show both with a mathematical model and\nwith evidence from controlled laboratory experiments with P. megacephala\nthat deleterious information cascades can also be avoided if there is some\nsmall rate of infidelity to the current socially selected option. That is, it is\npossible for the occurrence of individual-level mistakes to be a mechanism that\nparadoxically reduces the likelihood of group-level mistakes \u2013 possibly at the\ncost of reducing the equilibrium level of group agreement or the convergence\nrate of a group decision.\nFrom Ants to Human Decision Support Systems\nIn this section, connections have been made between sequential decision mod-\nels in human systems and foraging recruitment dynamics in ants. Whereas the\nrisk of information cascades is of critical importance in the human systems, the\nant models show at least two mechanisms that can prevent deleterious infor-\nmation cascades, namely:\n\u2022 Linear recruitment, which can be implemented by one individual only\nrecruiting a finite number of others, generates social allocations in propor-\ntion to quality. Consensus on a single option is lost, but the social allocations\ncan respond flexibly to changes in quality.\n\u2022 Individual errors, which represent the propensity of an individual to\nchoose an option that differs from the social choice, allow for nonlinear\nrecruitment mechanisms that nonetheless are sensitive to changes in option\nquality. Groups effectively reach consensus on a single option, but enough\nerror-prone individuals will monitor for changes in the distribution of\nquality and be able to steer the group consensus toward new, high-quality\noptions.\nFor the case of markets, the latter case of individuals making social errors is\nessentially capturing the effect that Bass (1969) attributed to advertising in his\nclassic model of innovation diffusion through markets. That is, discovery ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Returning to\nthe online commerce example from earlier, the process of maintaining reviews\nfor products could be adjusted to implement a linear recruitment model.\nFor example, if a review recorded for a product automatically expired after\na finite number of times it was accessed, then every consumer of a product\nwould be limited to recruiting a finite number of new candidate consumers to\nthat product. In other words, automatically deleting reviews would induce an\napproximation of linear recruitment. In the case of T. rugatulus ants, linear\nrecruitment has the effect of allocating foragers to sites in proportion to their\nrelative quality, and those allocations update automatically with changes in\nquality (Shaffer et al. 2013). The analogous effect for online commerce would\nbe an automatic allocation of potential consumers in proportion to quality of\ncompeting products, and newly generated products would be guaranteed to\nbe discovered and gain market share.\nAdditional Examples: Rationality and Memory\nIn simple foraging experiments like the ones described so far, each option varies\nin its sugar concentration, and colonies are assumed to prefer higher concentra-\ntions over lower ones. In crevice-dwelling species, such as European honeybees\nand ants in the genus Temnothorax, colonies must frequently choose a new\nnest site from a finite number of choices in the environment (Franks et al.\n2002). Moreover, these nest sites can vary in a wide range of criteria of appar-\nent interest to the insect decision-makers (Visscher 2007). Consequently, ant\ncolonies such as T. rugatulus can be useful models for both understanding how\nindividual-level decision making scales to group-level decision making and how\nnatural systems solve multicriteria decision-making problems.\nIn a nest-site selection problem, the choice of a colony of ants is clear when\nthe colony moves into one of several presented candidate nest cavities. For\ncomparison, a similar test can be given to individual ants. In particular, indi-\nvidual T. rugatulus ants can be placed in controlled decision-making exper-\niments by placing them in an arena with a group of brood items (e.g. eggs,\nlarvae, or pupae). If multiple cavities are also placed in the arena, the indi-\nvidual will scrutinize the cavities and eventually transport brood into one of\nthem, which indicates her choice. Thus, individual-level decision-making can\nbe directly compared with group-level decision making. For example, Sasaki\nand Pratt (2012) presented a pair of nests \u2013 one that is constructed to be highly\npreferred over the other \u2013 to individual ants as well as to groups of ants. In\nthat case, both the individual and the group selected the nest constructed to beDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, when four pairs of high- and low-quality nests were\ngiven, the ability of an individual ant to choose a high-quality nest from the\neight candidates became no better than chance. Despite the difficulty observed\nfor the individual ant, colonies continued to perform well in the 4-pair test;\na high-quality nest was overwhelmingly preferred. These results indicate that\ncognitive overload does exist in individual ants but is somehow mitigated by\nthe information aggregation process at the level of the colony. This observation\nsuggests that carefully selected information aggregation mechanisms may be\nable to pool assessments in human groups so that the group can make good\ndecisions among a group of alternatives so large that would overwhelm the\ncognitive capacities of a single individual. For example, rather than asking indi-\nviduals to evaluate every option simultaneously, it may be more effective at the\ngroup level to have individuals nominally only evaluate one option and recruit\nothers to those options based on their enthusiasm. Asking a customer to leave\na product rating (e.g. 4 out of 5 stars) without any reference to competing alter-\nnatives may be viewed as a crude approximation of this kind of recruiting.\nEven when choosing among a small number of alternatives, decisions can be\ncomplicated by multiple, competing criteria whose relative value may change\nover time and experience. In the case of T. rugatulus ants choosing among\nnests that vary in darkness and entrance size, the best nest will be the darkest\nand have the smallest entrance size. However, depending on the available nests,\nthere may be a conflict between the objective of maximizing darkness and\nminimizing entrance size. Furthermore, if a colony migrates from one region\nto another, the importance of attending to one of the features (e.g. darkness)\nmay vary (e.g. if all nests in the new area have the same darkness). To test\nwhether ant colonies vary in their attentiveness to certain features based on\ntheir history, Sasaki and Pratt (2013) gave colonies of T. rugatulus the choice\nof two nests that varied in both darkness and entrance size. This allowed for a\nmeasurement of a baseline preference for the two nests. Colonies could then\nbe subjected to an intermediate choice trial of two nests that varied in only one\nof the two features \u2013 darkness or entrance size \u2013 and then brought back to the\noriginal baseline choice context. Ants that were subjected to an intermediate\ntreatment where both nests matched in darkness were found to more strongly\nprefer entrance size when returning to the baseline case. Similarly, ants that\nexperienced the intermediate treatment where both nests matched in entrance\nsize had less of a preference for entrance size when brought back to the baseline\ncase. Thus, somewhere within the T. rugatulus ant colony, there is a social\nmemory that stores the preferences of the colony and can be changed with\nexperience to new habitats. Similarly, in a study of Atta insularis leaf-cutter\nants, Nicolis et al. (2013) found that activity patterns at the nest entrance\nwere best described by a dynamical system model with parameters indicating\nthat the system is at the edge of chaos (Feigenbaum 1978; Langton 1990;\nLewin 1999; Mora and Bialek 2011). In this region, the activity patterns of theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, when the oscillations vary greatly from the\nexternally generated temperature oscillations, the internal oscillations of the\nant colony can self-organize to entrain on the external temperature oscilla-\ntions. Thus, like the T. rugatulus preferences for one criterion over another,\nthe leaf-cutter ants can tune a colony-level operational parameter based on\nexperience. These two examples \u2013 T. rugatulus and A. insularis \u2013 demonstrate\nthat these ant systems can provide insights into how social memory emerges\nwithin a group, drives the actions of that group, and can be altered by the\nexperience of the group over time.\nConclusions\nThroughout this chapter, examples have been given that showed how behavioral\necologists combine mathematical modeling with laboratory assays and field\nwork to test hypotheses of ever-increasing complexity. In every case, the par-\nticular research question of interest guides the choice of mathematical model\nas well as animal model. The kinds of research questions addressed in the first\nsection on the emergent patterns in large groups of self-interested individuals\nare qualitatively different than the questions from the previous section on the\nbehavior of tightly integrated groups of individuals with aligned interests. Con-\nsequently, the animal model systems for the research questions are similarly\ndiverse. Many examples exist of human groups with high levels of individual\ncompetition as well as examples of human groups with aligned interests due\nto high levels of group competition. No animal model is meant to be a per-\nfect match for a human society. Like a mathematical model, it is meant to be a\nsurrogate for a specific case that would be difficult to study directly.\nWhen combining mathematical modeling with the study of animal behavior,\nit is easy to make the mistake in assuming that animals must possess mathemat-\nical skills to be able to behave according to the mathematical model. As argued\nby Mottley and Giraldeau (2000), relatively simple learning heuristics can be\nused by a nutmeg mannikin to determine when to switch from the producer to\nscrounger tactic and back. Although predicting the SEF requires the behavioral\nanalyst to have some familiarity with calculus, there is no reason to believe that\nthe birds can do any level of mathematics. However, even under the assumption\nthat some birds are expertly trained mathematicians and could conceivably\ndeliberate on strategic foraging decisions, there is no reason to believe that\nlarge-scale demographic patterns in their tactic use are due to those sophisti-\ncated deliberative processes. Although anthropomorphism is rampant in popu-\nlar explanations of nonhuman animal behavior, the suggestion that nonhuman\nbehavior can provide a mental model for understanding human behavior is\noften met with skepticism because human cognition is held up as being singu-\nlarly different. Even taking for granted that human cognition is so marvelous,\nthere is no reason to believe that the higher cognition that humans are endowed\nwith plays a significant role in the day-to-day patterns seen in human groups.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

As said by Box (1979), \u201call models are wrong but\nsome are useful.\u201d The goal of modeling is not to find the most correct model\nbut to find the most useful models. An ant is no more of a human than an\nequation, a statistic, or a line of code is. In the search for the most illuminating\nmodels, excluding insights from nonhuman systems is necessarily introducing\nmore error in our understanding, not less.\nAcknowledgments\nThe writing of this paper was supported by DARPA under the Bio-Inspired\nSwarming seedling project, contract FA8651-17-F-1013.

We then delve into why these efforts have so often\nfailed by exploring how people think and behave, which is inherently social,\nnot just complex. We look at how the use of models for research is different\nfor their use in decision-making (i.e. using models depends on the stakes).\nFinally, we conclude by considering the implications of how people make sense\nof the world around them (sensemaking) for verification and validation. This\nprovides a first glimpse into the complexities of context within behavioral\nmodeling.\nWhy Do People Do What They Do?\nThis question has inspired philosophers, artists, theologians, and writers for\ncenturies. Their musings on the nature of humanity have provided much fod-\nder for reflection, especially as they are so often contradictory of each other.\nBetween Hume and Descartes or Locke and Rousseau, we are often left feeling\nlike we are all blindly touching different parts of the same elephant, but never\nseeing the whole.\nThat frustration, and these same musings, inspired subsequent generations of\nscientists and researchers. Is the fault of our circumstances due to ourselves or\nour stars? Do we know because we think or because we feel? What are the limits\nof individuality and social conditioning? Historically, a constraining factor on\nour answers has been data. These big questions require a broad reach across\nthe globe in order to tease out the range of contextual variables that might lead\nto different behavioral pathways in different communities.\nThe digital age, however, provides new opportunities to understand what\npeople do, when they do it, how they do it, and, often, who they are with when\nthey are doing things. From geolocation data to social media postings, transac-\ntion receipts to health trackers, and smart homes to search histories, we now\nhave an overwhelming amount of data about people\u2019s lives. When laddered\nagainst traditional data sources, we can know a great deal about the rhythms of\nindividual lives. There are important gaps, and we will talk of those shortly. But\nthe hope is that this new trove of big data will provide unprecedented oppor-\ntunities to reopen the debates about human behavior, allowing us to explore\nanswers in an efficient, effective, and holistic manner.\nEverything Old Is New Again\nBut is this really a new frontier? Is this big data world really something we have\nnever seen before? The short answer is: not really.

Nor\nis it the first time we have ignored some of the gaps.\nMedicine and related fields such as human biology, and genetics have put\nforward multiple attempts to understand human behavior as emergent from\ndistinctive features and aspects of the human body. For example, the Greek\nphilosopher and founder of modern medicine, Hippocrates (460 BCE\u2013370\nBCE) theorized that four substances in the human body accounted for the\ndifferential temperament and behaviors of people. Galen (c. 131\u2013c. 201), the\nrevered Roman philosopher and clinician, extended the original theory by\nincluding the influence of place on the relative balance of humors and thus on\ntemperament and behavior. While we may dismiss such efforts through the\nlens of modern medicine, these practitioners were methodical and rigorous\nin data collection and keen observers of the cases before them. Their theo-\nries continue on even today \u2013 we now talk about stable temperaments, not\nhumors, but the concepts are closely linked. They were, in many ways, data\nscientists for their times, looking for patterns and generating potential causal\nexplanations.\nSo too were the many practitioners of craniometry, the popular eighteenth-\nand nineteenth-century science of measuring heads and cranial features in\norder to assess intellect, civilizability, and a range of other valued cognitive\ntraits. As Stepan (1982:33\u201334) argued \u201cthat the skull housed the brain, the\norgan of mind, was no doubt the chief reason for focusing attention on the\nskull.\u201d This endeavor emerged during an important historical moment. On\nthe one hand, Linnaeus had included humans alongside other primates on his\nclassificatory charts, inspiring questions and concerns regarding whether we\nmight be unique from these species. On the other hand, global conquest and\nslavery were premised on the differential status of human groups on the great\nchain of being (see Lovejoy 1964), and people went to great lengths to justify\nthese differences through references to physical characteristics. Within the\nheated debates shaping our understanding of humanity, craniometry sought\nto bring data to our discussions of uniqueness, differences, and potential (see\nGould 1996 for a full discussion of this work).\nThe advent of Mendelian genetics pushed efforts to understand behavior\ninto discussions of inheritance, with behavior often tied to one\u2019s parentage\nand wider culture. At the time, with what we knew, this was state-of-the-art\nscience \u2013 linking Mendel\u2019s work with the theories of Charles Darwin, Herbert\nSpencer, and Thomas Malthus in order to understand undesirable behavioral\npatterns. There was widespread concern that traits such as criminality,\nindebtedness, and promiscuity were inherited in the same ways as eye color\nand physical stature (Konner 2002). With the discovery of DNA, the work\nbecame more nuanced but continued nonetheless. The Human Genome\nProject offered hope that, among other things, we might identify the biological\nantecedents of behavioral differences through the shared language of theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

With enough data and enough profiles, a genome database\ncould be sorted to identify the patterns and outliers, moving us toward an\never-refined understanding of human actions and choices.\nLike the glow surrounding big data today, this same aura of possibility\ndefined public perceptions about these various endeavors to explain human\nbehavior: can we identify gene sequences that are linked to depression, to risk\ntaking, to greater sociality, to focus and concentration, and so on? Yet it is\nworth noting that this remains more a dream than a reality. As Gould (1996:32)\nremarked more than 20 years ago and more than 40 years after Watson and\nCrick\u2019s discovery:\nWe are living in a revolutionary age of scientific advance for molecular\nbiology. From the Watson-Crick model of 1953 to the invention of PCR\nand the routine sequencing of DNA \u2013 for purposes as varied as O.J.\nSimpson\u2019s blood signature to deciphering the phylogeny of birds \u2013 we\nnow have unprecedented access to information about the genetic\nconstitution of individuals. We naturally favor, and tend to overextend,\nexciting novelties in vain hope that they may supply general solutions\nor panaceas \u2013 when such contributions really constitute more modest\n(albeit vital) pieces of a much more complex puzzle. We have so treated\nall great insights about human nature in the past, including nongenetic\ntheories rooted in family and social dynamics\u2026 If insightful nongenetic\ntheories could be so egregiously exaggerated in the past, should we be\nsurprised that we are now repeating this error by overextending the\ngenuine excitement we feel about genetic explanation? [emphasis added]\nAs Konner notes, human behavior remains a complex phenomenon influ-\nenced by multiple streams: \u201canthropology, biology, medicine, evolution, the\nrain, childhood, history, and culture,\u201d to cite a few (Konner 2018). And just\nas there are limits on our ability to predict the weather even when we under-\nstand it, there may be limits to our ability to offer precise empirical predic-\ntions regarding human behavior, even when we understand it. This shifts how\nwe think of the value and purpose of models themselves, pushing us more\ntoward models-as-thinking-tools, vs. models-as-predictive (see Konner 2015\nfor a more detailed discussion).\nNonetheless, we push forward in our data collection efforts regarding climate\nand weather patterns. Similarly, advancements in our understanding of human\nbehavior will only happen when we have relevant advancements in these and\nother fields, and this will only happen when we have systematic, rigorous data\ncollection, with careful attention to the gaps: to the people, places, and things\nwe cannot or did not track. In the glee over big data, it is important to remember\nthat not everyone is a participant, nor are we always clear about how the data\nwas collected. These sources of uncertainty should temper our modeling, justDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Attention to the quality of the data,\nhow it can be used, and what it reveals is as important as knowing that data is\navailable, and for these judgments, modelers should partner closely with social\nscientists.\nPerhaps one of the lasting lessons of Konner\u2019s notably interdisciplinary\ncareer is that crosscutting work is essential but challenging \u2013 necessary, and\nnot impossible, but not nearly as easy as stating that \u201cX behavior means Y.\u201d\nThose who venture into these woods would do well to study the reasons why\nwe have not yet devised the magic box. It is not because of lack of information,\nor effort, or smarts. It requires a different way of asking questions and framing\nproblems: collaborative, iterative, broad-reaching, attentive to contextual\nfactors, and attentive to limitations. Studying the history of these past efforts\nto quantify and model human behavior will provide insights regarding the\npitfalls of exuberance with each new technological advancement.\nThis undoubtedly raises the question as to why modeling behavior is so chal-\nlenging. Our conversation turned at this point to Matthew Brashears.\nBehavior Is Social, Not Just Complex\nThose who study human behavior are keenly aware of how infuriating it can be\nto try to understand why people do what they do. Anyone who has survived\nto age eighteen has likely had this experience. But for those who make it their\ncalling and careers, armed with protocols and theories and measurement tools,\nanswers often remain elusive. Just when you think you have understood the\ndynamic, something changes.\nMatthew Brashears has made this challenge the cornerstone of his career.\nAs he explains, the core issue is not that social systems are complex, but that\ntheir operations vary depending on the decisions and perceptions of the per-\nsons within them. For example, individuals do not simply cut off contact to\nrandom others as systems grow larger, but make choices based on how cat-\negory membership appears relevant at the time. Moreover, these perceptions\nare not simply random, but are highly patterned according to social processes\nand, themselves, change over time. For example, a spreading religious doctrine\nnot only recruits new members into an organization but also can cut them off\nto a degree from future behavioral diffusion, changing the nature of the land-\nscape over which organizations compete. Successful modeling of social systems\ntherefore requires the ability to incorporate the changing and contingent nature\nof entities and processes directly into the fabric of the simulation.\nTo cope with these cognitive demands, humans use a variety of psychologi-\ncal tricks to process social information more efficiently. In particular, humans\nuse compression heuristics (Brashears 2013) or rules that allow social networksDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n268 Moving Social-Behavioral Modeling Forward: Insights from Social Scientists\nto be reconstructed from partial information, allowing most of the informa-\ntion on specific connections between individuals to be discarded. Beginning\nwith a nonsocial example, if an individual is asked to remember a sequence of\nnumbers, such as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on, they would simply remember the\nfirst number, 2, and a rule that the sequence increases by an interval of two.\nThese two pieces of information are sufficient to reproduce the sequence in\nits entirety and are quite easy to learn and remember. In contrast, a series of\nnumbers with no such clear pattern, for example, 7, 2, 76, 21, and 99, can still\nbe recalled but only through the use of repetition (i.e. brute force). Applying\ncompression heuristics to social information follows the same logic. If we can\ndiscard recall of specific connections among group members in favor of partic-\nular rules, then we can recall a larger amount of social information in the same\nbrain mass. A series of innovative studies have tested this proposition, find-\ning that triads and kin relations function as compression heuristics (Brashears\n2013; Brashears et al. 2016); that while network recall is flexible, the default unit\nof relationship encoding appears to be the triad (Brashears and Quintane 2015);\nthat females exhibit a significant advantage in network recall relative to males\n(Brashears et al. 2016), and that affective balance operates as a compression\nheuristic (Brashears and Brashears 2016).\nIn general there are two classes of compression heuristics: structural and cul-\ntural. Structural heuristics are those that derive from the properties of a social\nnetwork graph and thus can be inferred without additional social information\nbeing given. Microstructural features of networks such as triadic closure (i.e. a\ngroup of three individuals who all share relations) and four cycles (i.e. a group\nof four individuals with four relationships, but no closed triads) can be deduced\nsimply by examining a graph, even if one is ignorant of the labels attached\nto particular actors (e.g. mother, second cousin, best friend). While structural\nheuristics are likely learned as children mature and encounter group life, struc-\nturally reducible network features are not culturally specific, and thus these\nheuristics should appear in many, if not all, human societies.\nCultural heuristics are normative expectations for how particular types of\nactors should be connected. For example, if John and Sue are siblings, and\nJake is Sue\u2019s nephew, then we can infer that John is likely Jake\u2019s dad. These\ntypes of relations are not easily derivable from the structure of the graph itself\nbecause the same graphs are consistent with many different relationships. For\nexample, John, Jake, and Sue as mutual friends and John, Jake, and Sue as par-\nent/child, siblings, and aunt/nephew both create a closed triadic structure. As a\nresult, cultural heuristics must be learned and then activated when the situa-\ntion seems appropriate. However, these cultural heuristics permit significantly\nlarger compression ratios by encoding larger amounts of information into a\nhandful of terms. For example, the term aunt implies something about relative\nage, sex, and common family relationships. Moreover, these heuristics allow\nindividuals to infer the presence of additional relationships not otherwise given,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nBehavior Is Social, Not Just Complex 269\nas in the above example of Jake, Sue, and John. As such, while cultural heuristics\nare more challenging to study due to their cultural variability, they offer signif-\nicant information processing advantages. However, inappropriately activated\nschemas (e.g. using a triadic heuristic for a network containing only open triads)\nalso have the potential to worsen recall, since the heuristic leads individuals to\nexpect connections that do not exist (e.g. Brashears 2013; Freeman 1992).\nWhen taken seriously, compression heuristics have important implications\nnot just for how people think about networks, but for how realized social net-\nworks grow. For quite some time, the most dangerous threat to a group of\nhumans has been another group of humans, with larger groups generally tri-\numphing over smaller groups (DeScioli and Kurzban 2009). This implies that\nhumans were under significant selection pressure to adopt network structures\nthat permitted larger groups to be achieved. Compression heuristics provided\none response to such pressure. Groups that conform to these heuristics are eas-\nier to cognitively manage, which suggests that members will make fewer social\nerrors when interacting. In that they reduce the cognitive difficulty of managing\nsocial networks, compression heuristics should also permit the development of\nlarger groups. As a result, we should expect that some of the regular features of\nobserved human social networks are a result of not simply our cognitive limits,\nbut of the strategies we adopted to circumvent those limitations.\nCompression heuristics in general, and cultural heuristics in particular,\ntherefore present an interesting challenge to the modeler: individuals make\nchoices based on their perceptions, but perceptions are shaped by the par-\nticular heuristics that they activate, and these heuristics are, themselves,\nfrequently social products. Moreover, decisions made on the basis of a selected\nheuristic will influence behaviors shaping the observed structure of a social\ngroup, thereby reinforcing some heuristics, as well as making others more/less\nrelevant, thereby triggering a new round of heuristic (in)activation. Finally,\ndeveloping a model for such complex processes must proceed in conjunction\nwith identifying the existence of the heuristics in question. In other words, we\nlack a complete list of all of the things we need to be modeling, and the list\nitself is changing continually.\nThe problem above likely now seems insurmountable. Indeed, our difficul-\nties in understanding social behavior likely resemble nothing so much as those\na Victorian scientist would encounter in trying to understand a personal com-\nputer connected to the internet. They might, with strenuous effort, be able to\ncorrelate inputs to outputs and develop a working understanding of what the\nmachine does, only to inadvertently open a new application that changes all\nthe rules, connect to a multitude of resources not located anywhere they can\neasily grasp, or even accidentally reboot the machine into a different operating\nsystem. Likewise, human behavior is dependent on complex routines specific\nto particular tasks (e.g. seduction vs. polite collaboration), on social rules and\nunderstandings not fully resident in a specific individual (e.g. norms residentDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n270 Moving Social-Behavioral Modeling Forward: Insights from Social Scientists\nin the social cloud), and on systems for evaluating events and circumstances\n(e.g. definitions of the situation) that shape how we perceive inputs and how we\nselect behaviors to enact. Yet, the difficulty is not insurmountable once mod-\nelers can wrap their heads around it. Efforts to specify social entities and pro-\ncesses precisely fail not because social science is imprecise, but because social\nprocesses are more dynamic and contingent than any other domain yet stud-\nied. Thus, in order to model them successfully, it is necessary to develop entirely\nnew approaches to modeling itself.\nBut the modeling we develop will depend in large part on what we hope it\nwill yield and how we intend to use it. For some reflections on this, we turned\nto Laura McNamara.\nWhat is at Stake?\nExtending Brashears\u2019 compression metaphor, modeling human behavior is akin\nto transcribing an orchestral performance into a musical score. It is the act of\ntaking a live, contextually rich, multi-actor experience and translating it into a\nstandardized, shared code.1 As any musician knows, the score is a framework,\nbut every subsequent playing of that piece will have subtle (and not-so-subtle)\ndifferences depending on the skills of the players, the preferences of the con-\nductor, the acoustics of the room, the size of the audience, and a multitude of\nother factors. Hence what gets coded into the score matters tremendously if\nthe point is a general guide vs. an instruction manual for how to repeat a spe-\ncific rendition of a piece. The latter case requires a far greater level of detail\nto account for the many contextual factors that influence sound in a particular\nevent, whereas the former would be a traditional score.\nIn building computational models of human behavior, this matters because\nwhy we model is equally as important as what and how we model. As the resi-\ndent anthropologist within a nuclear laboratory, the question of why people do\nwhat they do is pivotal to McNamara\u2019s work. When people make bad choices\nin nuclear facilities, the consequences can be devastating. But potentially more\ncatastrophic is when people make a decision using a tool that is not suited for\nthose purposes. Thus for McNamara, understanding why we model behavior\ncan mean the difference between a conceptual exercise gone sideways and a\ndevastating event.\nModeling as a research practice is exploratory. It helps teams to understand\nwhat happened in the past and what might happen under hypothetical future\nconditions. Its purpose is to extend the range of ways that we think about\n1 Thanks to Todd Richmond, faculty at Pardee-RAND Graduate School, for the comparison\nbetween computational modeling and musical scores.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nWhat is at Stake? 271\nproblems and opportunities. Modeling in these cases can help generate future\nresearch questions. For example, research in behavioral genetics indicates\nsome heritability of temperament dimensions such as sociality, activity,\nshyness, adaptability, attention/persistence, and overall emotionality (Saudino\n2005). Yet as with most genetic studies, these findings are based on a limited,\nprimarily Euro-American data set. If we were to extend the data more broadly,\nincluding vastly different cultural contexts, we could begin to model more\nsophisticated questions as to when, why, and how genes influence temper-\nament across the life course. Researchers could include longitudinal work\nto understand how cultural and environmental factors might influence gene\nexpression or look at the prevalence of genetic markers across different pop-\nulations, thereby generating new questions regarding differential prevalence\nrates of, say, attention disorders across communities.\nIn this work, the researchers have more flexibility to be wrong. The purpose is\nto see how models behave in order to generate questions for continued refine-\nment in the research. It is a tool for improving and assisting in learning, with an\noutcome that is intended to be an indicator, not an answer. Therefore, the stan-\ndards we apply for validation and verification would be somewhat more relaxed\ngiven that the goal is to inspire more thinking.\nThe danger comes in when modeling as a research practice becomes mod-\neling as an applied decision-making tool. Unlike the exploratory roaming of\nthe former, the latter is focused. In these cases, models are designed to help\nteams think through multiple scenarios and select one that holds the most\npromise for achieving a desired outcome. The goal is action oriented. Models as\ndecision-making tools are intended to give reliable, accurate, and valid results\nbecause they will be used to inform choices that have real-world consequences.\nSlippage between the two rationales happens all too often and often with\nproblematic consequences. Konner (2002) reminds us that this very shift\nfrom exploratory to decision-making led to the worst abuses of the eugenics\nmovement, to decades of forced sterilizations, to lobotomies, to discriminatory\npractices in classrooms and workplaces, and to institutionalizing people \u2013 all\nbecause exploratory models indicated potential social problems. All are\nexamples where society linked \u201cbiological determinism to some of the oldest\nissues and errors of our philosophical traditions,\u201d including reductionism,\nreification, and hierarchy (see Gould 1996:27).\nBig data has not necessarily improved the situation and, in fact, can be seen to\nexacerbate it through an aura of rigor and science that it may not warrant. Con-\nsider the case in which judges used the proprietary COMPAS model to make\nsentencing decisions based on predicted risk of recidivism \u2013 including deny-\ning parole to offenders whose behavior would otherwise merit release. Prior to\nits implementation, this technology had not been through any robust, public,\nand transparent process of verification or validation, but for all intents and pur-\nposes, some judges seem to have accredited COMPAS for sentencing decisions.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In the latter environment,\nthe consequences are quite different. COMPAS might be referenced in\npapers and discussed in graduate student research seminars; it might raise\ncommunity-level questions about the quality of the data being used; it may\nbe even lead policy-makers to pass legislation supporting the collection and\ncuration of better data sets to refine what we know about recidivism at the\npopulation level. It is probably easy for most of us in the research community\nto imagine how COMPAS would serve as a research tool to inform academic\nand policy debates about incarceration, rehabilitation, and the opportunities\nfacing parolees after release.\nAs a sentencing tool, the same technology is being used to predict outcomes\nat the level of the individual. Yet it is not clear that the creators of this tech-\nnology are assuming any responsibility for the application of what is probably a\npopulation-level model to prediction of individual future behaviors. Are judges\napplying this technology asking questions about the quality of the data, the\ncorrectness of the software implementation, or the validity of the model? Do\nlaw school graduates have the mathematical literacy or ethical sensitivity to\nrecognize the danger of applying what is likely a population-level model to pre-\ndict individual outcomes? What is clear is tat COMPAS is having a strong and\nperhaps frightening impact on individual lives (see Wexler 2017).\nFor McNamara, it is critical to remember that all models and simulations\nultimately run within a social domain. Understanding the actors, motivations,\nand contexts that shape the tool and why it was requested are pivotal if we are\nto design modeling scenarios that achieve the desired outcomes.\nAnd how do we know if our models have achieved a desired outcome? Con-\nsidering the advice from the panelists, how do we think about verification and\nvalidation in the context of behavioral modeling? Our final discussant, Chris-\ntian Madsbjerg, turned his considerable energy toward this issue.\nSensemaking\nContinuing with the COMPAS model used for predicting recidivism, one of the\nacademic reviewers of the algorithm noted the following:\nThe problem isn\u2019t necessarily that COMPAS is unsophisticated, says\nFarid, but that it has hit a ceiling in sophistication.

Their sensemaking process (see Madsbjerg 2017\nfor details) begins with understanding the cultural contexts in which work\nwill occur (as McNamara recommended), prioritizing human intelligence\ngleaned from real-world observations to define the relevant factors, and\nthen back translating those insights into identifiable patterns in massive\ndata sets.\nOne way to begin improving the algorithms is to rethink how we collect and\nchoose the information that will inform the model, as well as rethinking the\nresults of an algorithm once formed. There are four main problems with algo-\nrithms that could be addressed by social scientists:\n1. The underlying models and algorithms risk being biased by the opinion of the\nstakeholders and data scientists developing them, which can lead to models\nbased on incorrect assumptions about people or overlook the particulari-\nties of a culture or market. To avoid or mitigate such outcomes, modelers\nshould partner with social scientists who have a deep familiarity with the\non-the-ground complexity of a particular topic. These partnerships will help\nunpack the compression heuristics described by Brashears so that we can see\nthe full range of nuance and complexity and model appropriately.\n2. The data sets used for the algorithms are based more on availability than on\naccuracy. Models can easily be limited to the data sets that are most read-\nily available, which may or may not include the most relevant indicators or\nproxies of behavior to be working with. This harkens back to Konner\u2019s warn-\nings about past efforts to explain behavior through cranial measurements or\ninheritance. Relying solely on what is available does not necessarily tell you\nwhether this data is suited for the challenge of modeling human behavior. All\ndata sets have gaps and weaknesses, and taking time to identify what these\nare, to consider how it will impact the modeling, and determining whether\nthere are other ways to bolster or support the work are essential steps to\nensuring a valid and verifiable model. But this means a critical dive into the\ndata: Is it current? Is it from the right population? What other data might\nsupport or contradict these findings?Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A flawed algorithm may only serve to reinforce existing faulty ways of\nthinking. Beyond the COMPAS example cited above, we have seen multiple\nexamples in which flawed algorithms perpetuate false assumptions (see\nBaer and Kamalnath 2017; Knight 2017). As algorithms are increasingly\nused to assess credit, provide access to job opportunities, and assess work\nperformance, we run the risk that constitutionally problematic human\nbiases such as those based on gender and race are reinforced if the biases\nare not corrected in the underlying data. To the extent that a bias is\npervasive in a culture, it is unlikely to be questioned or challenged in the\ndesign of the algorithm.\n4. A flawed algorithm creates a false sense of security, when, in fact, it fails to\nsolve the problem it was intended for. When the results of the algorithm are\nnot observed to be solving the problem, we need to return to the drawing\nboard. But we need sufficient perspective and insight to recognize when the\nalgorithm itself is failing.\nThe key challenge for successful computational modeling of human behavior\nis knowing which kinds of data are meaningful \u2013 and how the combinations\nof different data points, once contextualized, make sense and can be used to\nexplain broader patterns of behavior. In contrast to using common sense or\nhard variables as the initial inputs to an algorithm, qualitative data-informed\nvariables of human behaviors, essentially preliminary assumptions about why\npeople do what they do, are more likely to generate data that mirrors reality.\nIn Silo Effect, Tett (2015) provides an account of how New York City had\nto rethink its approach to predicting which buildings were likely to become\nfiretraps when its algorithm failed to predict accurately. In the decade before\n2011, there were an average of 2700 structural fires resulting in 85 deaths per\nyear in NYC. Despite the 20 000 reported complaints of dangerous housing per\nyear, inspections revealing unsafe conditions occurred only 13% of the time,\nand with only 200-odd inspectors to monitor four million properties, in one\nmillion buildings, the magnitude of the challenge was clear. The team knew\nthat the root cause stemmed from properties that had been illegally subdivided\nto enable landlords to extract more rent.\nAn initial hypothesis was that reports of illegally converted building from\nthe city\u2019s 311 line could help, but it was found not to be a good predictor as the\nmajority of calls came from lower Manhattan, and not from the outer boroughs,\nwhere most fires or illegal conversions happened. Instead, the city government\nspent time with firemen, policemen, and inspectors from various municipal\ndepartments to learn clues for the existence of problems. Based on their conver-\nsations with these people, they found several warning indicators: buildings con-\nstructed before 1938 (when codes were looser) and were located in poor neigh-\nborhoods; homeowners delinquent on mortgage payments; and the buildings\nhad typically received complaints about issues like vermin. Once the team wasDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The key ques-\ntion is: how can we stop ourselves from overlooking an important aspect of\nthe equation? One answer is to incorporate social science methods in order to\nidentify the most relevant factors. The ways in which social scientists mine and\nanalyze data can provide new theories and hypotheses for why people, commu-\nnities, and societies behave the way they do, based on empirical observation,\ndeep appreciation of the social context, and informed analyses.\nFinal Thoughts\nModeling human behavior is no small challenge, yet it is a critical component\nof everything from algorithmic platforms that predict the risk of child mal-\ntreatment and terrorist activity to those that assess credit worthiness and job\nsuitability to those that recommend movies and social contacts. As researchers\nand practitioners move forward in these efforts, they would be wise to part-\nner with social scientists who have a deep understanding of the communities\nimpacted by these algorithms.\nWe know these partnerships are challenging. It can feel at times like learning\na foreign language on the fly when all you really want are some basic directions.\nIn order to facilitate these efforts, we recommend starting with the following\nquestions and considerations:\n1. Pay attention to history: When have we tried something like this in the past?\nWhat did we learn from those efforts? Are our tools realistically suited to this\nchallenge? What part of the puzzle will this be? Why will this effort improve\nour understanding?\n2. Cross-train: Computational modelers should read the social sciences litera-\nture around the subjects they model. There is good writing about people and\ncultures \u2013 taking an active interest in this will make modelers more success-\nful in their efforts. So too should social scientists embrace the possibilities\nand work of modeling. It is imperative that we have, at minimum, a passing\nunderstanding of how modeling works, of the different types of models, and\nof the insights possible through well-crafted simulations and a keen appre-\nciation for how our work intersects with and informs modeling.\n3. Understand the context: How do we design models that have as much agility\nand fluidity as human behavior? What are the suite of contextual factorsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Of note is that the\nchoices may seem endless, but the contextual factors are not.\n4. Clarify purpose: Is the modeling for exploration or learning? How do we\ndeliberately and thoughtfully transition between the two (and not just slip\ninto decision-making)? What is good enough when it comes to verification\nand validation of models used for decision-making? Should validation\ninclude addressing issues of ethics and privacy?\n5. Guide the translation: Let social scientists understand the phenomenon first,\nand then ask them what each finding might look like in data. For example,\nif the goal is to model radicalization in a fringe community, what would\nchange in social networks, in online searches, in spending behavior, in geolo-\ncation patterns, and in the tone of social exchanges? And what would we not\nsee in large data sets? The questions are designed to connect the behavioral\ninsights of social scientists to documented data sets where modelers could\ntease out relevant factors such as the frequency, intensity, and direction of\nbehavioral change.\nThe challenge and opportunity inherent in building computational models of\nhuman behavior is simultaneously enticing and overwhelming. Our goal herein\nwas to offer a few steps toward building a connective thread between the teams\nthat specialize in the modeling work and those that specialize in understanding\nhuman behavior. The most good will come from patience, openness, and con-\ntinued effort down a collective path. Because what is clear from our panelists is\nthat siloed work on these efforts will be useless at best, destructive at worst.\nReferences\nBaer, T. and Kamalnath, V. (2017).

It affects the process by which people form attitudes toward\ntheir governments, other population groups, or external actors. Group\ndecision-making applications span political, military, economic, and legal\ndomains. If computational social science is to aid in understanding, anticipat-\ning, and shaping such real-world contexts, then the development of accurate\nand broadly applicable models of social influence is essential. This chapter pro-\nposes that a deliberate and concerted integration of experimental investigation\nand computational modeling is needed to develop these models, an effort that\nwill also advance the fundamental knowledge of social influence dynamics.\nWithin social psychology, social influence has largely been studied via the\nexperimental testing of discrete theoretical hypotheses that express how\na dependent variable responds to a change in an independent variable in\nqualitative language (e.g. increases, decreases, inverted U-shape). Quantitative\nreasoning is often employed in the rationale for theoretical propositions, and,\nto a much lesser extent, formal or computational models are also used to moti-\nvate them. While this process has been successful in revealing and extensively\nprobing individual phenomena, it has been less effective at synthesizing and\nreconciling concurrent and competing processes. Such synthesis would better\ninform the development of computational models as to the relative strengths\nof different processes and their interaction. It is especially important if one\nseeks to apply a model to anticipate the behavior of a particular group of\ninterest. For instance, the group polarization effect might predict that a group\nwill pursue an extreme policy, whereas majority influence points toward a\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Consequently, guidance as to how those two processes play\nout together is necessary in order to model the group\u2019s overall behavior. That\nguidance, of course, would need to be context dependent. As will be seen, the\nfailure of group polarization theory to be integrated with broader social influ-\nence phenomena leads it to predict that every group of like-minded members\nwill become more extreme, regardless of their initial opinion distribution. This\nis not so for the frame-induced polarization theory to be described below\nthat does integrate group polarization with majority influence and consensus\npressure: the theory can explain a systematic tendency for like-minded groups\nto become more extreme while being able to predict that individual groups\nwill not.\nThe difficulty of synthesis in traditional social influence research has not,\nhowever, deterred a surge of modeling research across a range of disciplines.\nThis activity has not been an unalloyed good for computational social science\nas much of this work has proceeded with little regard for empirical support. Siz-\nable and divergent streams of research have arisen around particular modeling\napproaches with murky domains of validity. This proliferation casts doubt upon\nthe empirical relevance of the associated behavioral findings and complicates\nmodel selection and evaluation for applications.\nThe integrated approach advocated here calls for experiments designed with\nthe explicit purpose of quantitatively testing computational models against\ndata. It will help restore the balance between modeling and experimental\nvalidation. The development of computational models in conjunction with\nexperiment will force researchers to reckon more intently on combining\nconcurrent effects in order to make quantitative predictions. That is, a more\nunified theory will have effects be caused by multiple factors that earlier\nwork associates with separate hypotheses. A greater orientation of experi-\nments toward testing models rather than seeking new effects will encourage\nreplication efforts and so place empirical findings on more solid ground. The\nincreased focus on synthesis and the inevitable failures of previously successful\nmodels as they are tested in new regimes will spur theoretical innovation as\nwell. Eventually, this integrated modeling-experiment approach will lead to\nconvergence upon a set of social influence models that have substantial exper-\nimental support and so can be confidently extended to larger-scale systems or\nincluded within more complex simulations of particular application contexts.\nThis chapter first presents a brief survey of social influence and related group\ndecision-making research, along with a discussion of how standard hypothesis\ntesting and also quantitative modeling have been employed. The second section\nprovides an overview of opinion network modeling. Next, the quantitative test-\ning of computational models on experimental data is illustrated using recent\nwork on group polarization (Gabbay et al. 2018; Gabbay forthcoming), which\nalso shows how the modeling goal of synthesizing concurrent effects can lead to\nnew and more unified theory. The fourth section then sketches the envisioned\nintegration of modeling and experiment and discusses its potential benefits.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We focus upon research involving attitudes,\nopinions, and judgments here, mental constructs that often guide behavior.\nClassic social influence phenomena include conformity \u2013 the tendency and\npressures toward consensus in groups, majority and minority influence \u2013 the\nability of majorities and minorities to sway group opinions, and group polariza-\ntion \u2013 the tendency of discussion among like-minded people to make positions\nmore extreme. Two primary types of influence routes have often been invoked\nas explanations of such behaviors, normative and informational. Normative\ninfluence refers to the operation of group and broader social norms in setting\nexpectations as to appropriate opinions and the value of consensus. Informa-\ntional influence is the acceptance of information from others as evidence about\nthe reality of the subject under consideration. Informational influence typi-\ncally involves the alignment of one\u2019s private and publicly expressed judgments,\nwhereas public agreement need not imply private acceptance under normative\ninfluence.\nThe body of social influence research above has been established through\na process of hypothesis testing via laboratory experiments. Groundbreaking\nstudies were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s (see Eagly and Chaiken\n1993, Chapter 13). In a classic experiment by Asch, a substantial proportion\nof subjects suspended the clear evidence of their senses when faced with\na majority of experimental confederates who stated that a clearly shorter\nline was longer, thereby demonstrating the power of conformity to induce\npublic compliance. Inverting the direction of influence as the process under\ninvestigation, Moscovici and collaborators found in a color discrimination\ntask that minorities who advocated consistent positions were more effective\nin swaying subjects than inconsistent minorities, leading to a theory that\nmajorities primarily exert normative influence, while minority influence\noccurs mostly via the informational route. Group polarization, the ten-\ndency of discussion among like-minded individuals to lead to more extreme\nopinions, is another element in the social influence canon. It has both infor-\nmational and normative influence explanations and will be discussed in detail\nbelow.\nResearch on group decision-making in contexts that allow for interpersonal\npersuasion also involves social influence. One strain of decision-making\nresearch considers the performance of groups in comparison with individuals\n(Kerr and Tindale 2004). For example, the wisdom-of-the-crowds hypothesis\nholds that simply aggregating individual judgments over many individuals\nyields greater accuracy than the judgments of individual experts under the\nassumption that the members of the pooled population make independent\njudgments whose uncorrelated errors cancel. Arguments have been made that\nsocial influence can either impair this performance by inducing correlatedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A hypothesis is\nproposed concerning the direction of an effect on the dependent variable,\nincrease or decrease, due to the variation of an independent variable, which is\nthen tested statistically. If the amount of change in the dependent variable is in\nthe theorized direction and improbably attributed to the null hypothesis of no\neffect, then the proposed hypothesis is said to be supported by the data.\nWithin the social influence and group decision-making domain, research\naffiliated with the literature on social decision schemes (SDS), which are\nessentially mathematical rules for combining group member initial prefer-\nences into a final decision, has most consistently pursued a model-based\nquantitative approach. Although initially concerned with juries and binary\n(innocent/guilty) decisions, the SDS program grew to include decisions\nconcerning quantitative judgments such as monetary awards and budgets\n(Hinsz 1999). While it has been very successful with respect to its original\njury concentration (Devine 2012), a shortcoming of the SDS program is that\nits focus on testing an array of aggregation rules has come at the expense of\ndeeper theoretical and model development with respect to a specific opinion\nchange process. This absence of a theoretical impetus inhibits generalization\nof the results to broader contexts \u2013 for example, when subgroup and social\nnetwork structure is important or for general opinion dynamics in populations\nnot associated with a focal decision point.\nOpinion Network Modeling\nAlthough the experimental study of social influence has been conducted by\nsocial psychologists and, to a much lesser degree, in other social sciences such\nas political science, sociology, and economics, the modeling of social influ-\nence dynamics has extended beyond social science to fields including physics,\napplied mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering (Crandall\net al. 2008; Castellano et al. 2009; Proskurnikov and Tempo 2017). While the\nprimary goal of opinion network models is to predict final opinions from initial\nones, the models typically describe a process that occurs over time. This section\nbriefly discusses approaches to opinion network modeling and their empirical\napplication.\nMany models of opinion change have been developed in the fields noted\nabove and beyond, involving a great diversity in methodological and substan-\ntive choices. One major methodological division involves whether outcomes\nare produced deterministically or stochastically. A fundamental substantive\ndivision involves the way opinions are mathematically represented. A binaryDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Alternatively, a\ncontinuous representation can account for gradations of opinion on an issue\nor for decisions involving either explicit numerical quantities such as budgets\nor that can be approximated as a spectrum of options ordered along some\ndimension (e.g. the extent of an escalatory military response). Binary (or\ndiscrete) opinion models tend to have stochastic interactions; continuous\nopinion models usually (but need not) employ deterministic interactions.\nThe choice of opinion representation also constrains the basic process that\ngoverns how opinions change when nodes (a term for individuals within a\nnetwork) interact. A binary opinion must either remain the same or flip when\na node interacts with other nodes. In the voter model, a dyadic interaction\nis assumed whereby a node adopts the opinion held by a network neighbor\nselected at random, whereas the majority rule model proceeds by selecting\nsubgroups at random with all member nodes adopting the majority opinion\nin the subgroup (Castellano et al. 2009). Continuous opinion models, on\nthe other hand, allow for incremental shifts in opinion where the amount of\nchange is a function of the distance between node opinions. The DeGroot and\nFriedkin\u2013Johnsen models, as well as the consensus protocol (popular in the\nengineering literature on control), use a linear dependence in which the shift\nis proportional to the opinion difference (DeGroot 1974; Olfati-Saber et al.\n2007; Friedkin and Johnsen 2011). Bounded confidence models assume a hard\nopinion difference threshold, within which nodes interact linearly but beyond\nwhich interaction produces no change (Lorenz 2007). The nonlinear model of\nGabbay (2007) uses a soft threshold so that, rather than vanishing completely,\nthe interaction decays smoothly with distance.\nThe vast majority of papers on opinion network models make no contact\nwith empirical data. They start with a model, reasoned to be plausible (some-\ntimes on the basis of social psychology research but sometimes on an appeal\nto common sense), and then generate simulation results, often in combination\nwith mathematical analysis, on phenomena such as how the time to reach con-\nsensus scales with system size, the conditions conducive to the formation of\ncamps of rival opinions, or the ability of extremists or influential individuals\nto shift opinions. Usually, the focus is on large systems taken to be represen-\ntative of population-scale behavior. Consequently, such empirical connections\nas are reported are usually on the level of noting that model-generated curves\nexhibit qualitatively similar shapes to relationships observed in naturally occur-\nring data from large population systems (Crandall et al. 2008; D\u00fcring et al. 2009;\nT\u00f6r\u00f6k et al. 2013). However, some models have been shown to quantitatively\nreproduce empirical relationships such as the distribution of votes in propor-\ntional elections (Fortunato and Castellano 2007; Burghardt et al. 2016).\nApplication of opinion network models to laboratory experiments remains\nmostly confined to testing models developed within traditional fields of humanDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Although the communication topology was controlled, the network\nweights assessing interpersonal and self-influence in the model had to be\ncalculated for each group separately on the basis of subjects\u2019 post-discussion\nratings of interpersonal influence, thereby limiting predictive capability.\nHowever, their work remains the most extensive experimental investigation\nof an opinion network model. More recent work has employed agent-based\nmodeling to qualitatively support and extend experimental results (M\u00e4s and\nFlache 2013; Moussa\u00efd et al. 2013, 2015).\nIntegrated Empirical and Computational Investigation\nof Group Polarization\nThis section provides an illustration of how experiment and opinion network\nmodeling can be integrated as applied to group polarization and serves as a pre-\nlude to the description of the integrated approach in the next section. Recent\nresearch is described that demonstrates how a modeling-oriented approach\ncan synthesize previously disjoint phenomena, generating a novel theoretical\nexplanation of a classic social influence phenomenon, which furthermore pre-\ndicts an effect unanticipated by existing theory (Gabbay et al. 2018). The basic\ntheory is implemented in a simple aggregation model that integrates group\npolarization with the fundamental social influence processes of majority influ-\nence and conformity. Further, a model of opinion network dynamics shows how\nthis basic process can arise from a lower-level attitude change framework that\nconsiders how persuasive messages shift both opinion and its associated uncer-\ntainty (Gabbay forthcoming). Both models not only qualitatively agree with the\nresults of an online discussion experiment but, in accord with the proposed\nintegration of modeling and experiment, are in quantitative agreement with the\ndata as well.\nGroup Polarization Theory\nThe question of how groups shift toward more extreme positions has been a\nfocus of both traditional social influence research and opinion network mod-\neling although the explanatory mechanisms favored by each are disconnected.\nGroup polarization is said to occur when, in a group composed of individuals\nalready on the same side of an issue, the post-discussion mean opinion shifts\nfurther in support of that side as compared with the pre-discussion mean\n(Myers 1982; Brown 1986; Isenberg 1986; Sunstein 2002).

The seminal experiments in\nthe 1960s focused on choice dilemmas in which subjects were presented\nwith hypothetical scenarios involving the choice between a risky but higher\npayoff option over a safer, lower payoff one (Brown 1986). Subjects were\nasked to choose the minimum odds of success they would accept in order\nto pursue the riskier option. For most choice dilemma items, discussion led\ngroups to choose lower odds of success as measured by the difference in the\ngroup pre- and post-discussion means. The effect, therefore, was originally\ncoined the risky shift. However, some choice dilemma items tended to pro-\nduce shifts toward greater caution, while others produced no shift in either\ndirection. Cautious items were marked by a very large stake such as someone\u2019s\nhealth or marriage, whereas risky items tended to offer a large potential\ngain for a small stake. Experiments on group betting involving real rather\nthan hypothetical stakes also have shown a mix of risky and cautious shifts\n(Isenberg 1986).\nBeyond the risk context, discussion among similarly inclined individuals\nwas found to cause more extreme social and political attitudes (Myers and\nBishop 1970; Schkade et al. 2010; Keating et al. 2016). Manipulation of the\nevidence presented to mock juries exhibited discussion-induced shifts to\nlower presumed guilt and softer sentences in cases where the evidence was\nweaker and higher presumed guilt and harsher sentences for stronger evidence\n(Myers 1982). Similarly, jury damage awards exhibit polarization (Schkade\net al. 2000). In general, the contexts in which group polarization occurs are\non the judgmental side of the intellective\u2013judgmental spectrum in which\npurely intellective tasks, such as math problems, have demonstrably correct\nsolutions, whereas purely judgmental tasks are matters of personal taste or\naesthetics (Laughlin and Ellis 1986). Most real-world decision contexts such\nas forecasting and policy-making are characterized by both intellective and\njudgmental aspects; they may draw on a body of knowledge (e.g. expertise on\na country\u2019s political system), yet judgments must be made as to significant\nuncertainties (e.g. the intentions of political leaders).\nCorresponding to the two main pathways of social influence, informational\nand normative processes underlie the two main explanations of group polariza-\ntion within social psychology. In the informational route, known as persuasive\narguments theory, group members expose each other to new information\nin favor of that side. In the normative route, known as social comparison\ntheory, a group norm associated with the broader culture or that particular\ngroup\u2019s identity defines a preferred direction on an issue so that opinions\nshift in the direction of the norm; a norm toward risk-taking, for instance,\nwould lead groups to make riskier choices as a result of discussion.

Relatedly, neither explanation has been developed with respect to\na clear formal model at the individual group level. Although the informa-\ntional and normative processes occur at the group level, these theories were\noperationalized mainly with respect to a population of groups with random\ninitial opinion distributions, over which majority influence could be assumed\nto cancel out. As a result, group polarization theory is effectively silent as to\nwhether a particular group with a specific initial distribution of opinions will\nbecome more extreme. Alternatively, one could make a strong reading of either\npersuasive arguments theory or social comparison theory that neglects other\nprocesses in which they always predict polarization for homogeneous groups\n(for sufficiently judgmental issues). Either alternative \u2013 silence or a uniform\nprediction of polarization \u2013 limits the ability of existing group polarization\ntheory to address real-world contexts such as whether, in the face of a foreign\npolicy crisis, discussion among a country\u2019s leadership will induce a shift toward\na more extreme course of action.\nOpinion network models do not suffer from an inability to go from initial to\nfinal opinions since that is their fundamental purpose. The dominant approach\nto modeling extremism within this literature has been to attribute higher net-\nwork weights to nodes with more extreme initial opinions (Deffuant et al. 2002;\nFriedkin 2015). This extremist-tilting approach is necessitated by the fact that\nin most continuous opinion models the mean opinion in networks with sym-\nmetric weights (i.e. the strength of influence is the same from node i to j as\nfrom node j to i) remains constant at its initial value, therefore preventing the\nshift in mean exhibited in group polarization. Consequently, extremists must\nbe assigned greater influence over moderates than vice versa in order to shift\nthe mean. Psychologically, this move is attributed to extremists\u2019 greater confi-\ndence, commitment, or stubbornness. Extremist tilting is not widely accepted\nwithin the literature dedicated to group polarization, however, and has received\nonly mixed experimental support (Zaleska 1982).\nFrame-Induced Polarization Theory\nThis section discusses the frame-induced theory of group polarization intro-\nduced by the author and Zane Kelly, Justin Reedy, and John Gastil (Gabbay et al.\n2018). This theoretical mechanism is complementary to and can operate simul-\ntaneously with the mechanisms of standard polarization theory (shorthand for\nboth persuasive arguments theory and social comparison theory). However, the\nframe-induced mechanism provides an explanation of group polarization that,\nunlike standard polarization theory, is integrated with consensus pressure and\nmajority influence, thereby enabling prediction given the group initial opinionDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The theory is developed specifically with respect to a quantitative\npolicy under debate, although it should prove applicable to opinions more\ngenerally. Examples of quantitative policies include budgets, investment\namounts, interest rates, jury damage awards, or military operation sizes. In\nits emphasis on how the policy is discussed, the theory takes into account the\nbasis of policy positions and not just the policy value alone. For the particular\ncontext discussed here, this basis is grounded in the theory of decision-making\nunder risk and uncertainty (Pleskac et al. 2015) and so constitutes a further\ntheoretical element that is integrated within the frame-induced theory.\nCrucial to the frame-induced theory is the recognition of a distinction\nbetween the policy under debate and the rhetorical frame by which it is dis-\ncussed. In general, one would expect the rhetorical frame to be a substantive\naspect of the policy for which there is substantial disagreement among group\nmembers. The frame could represent a key uncertainty or differences in how\ngroup members value the outcomes associated with the policy. A given issue\nmay admit multiple frames if there are different dimensions of comparable\ndisagreement. Yet, a single dominant rhetorical frame may emerge due to\ngroup-specific dynamics such as deliberate efforts to focus a debate as occurs\nin political framing (Chong and Druckman 2007). Persuasion, and hence\nagreement, is driven by proximity along the rhetorical frame not the policy\nitself. The shape of the rhetorical function that maps policy positions into\npositions along the rhetorical frame (rhetorical positions) plays an essential\nrole in frame-induced polarization theory.\nFocusing on when uncertainty is the source of the rhetorical frame, uncer-\ntainty can generate disagreement if group members have different estimates\nof the probability of either an unknown variable or an impending outcome. A\nsimple but important example involves a policy that depends on the outcome\nof a binary gamble so that the likelier one estimates the outcome to be: the\nmore stake one is willing to risk on its occurrence. For instance, one would pre-\nfer to invest more in a defense technology company (the policy), the greater\none\u2019s subjective probability that the pro-defense spending candidate in an elec-\ntion is likely to win (the rhetorical frame). The use of the subjective probability\nof a binary outcome as the rhetorical frame is also relevant to the experiment\ndescribed below.\nTwo important behaviors that impact group polarization arise from the\ndistinction drawn between policy and the rhetorical frame: (i) distribution\nreshaping, which preferentially facilitates the formation of extreme majorities\nand so generates group polarization, and (ii) heuristic frame substitution,\nwhich can enhance polarization on one side of the issue and suppress it on\nthe other. Distribution reshaping arises when a nonlinear rhetorical function\ncauses the relative spacing between group member rhetorical positions to beDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Consequently, the distribution\nof group member rhetorical positions will be reshaped with respect to the\ndistribution of policy positions. Such reshaping may reduce the rhetorical\ndistance within some subgroups relative to others as compared with their\ndistances directly along the policy itself, thereby affecting the composition\nof the majority that emerges during deliberations. Specifically, for a concave\n(downward curvature) rhetorical function, rhetorical position increases more\nslowly as the policy becomes more extreme. This causes the rhetorical distance\nbetween more extreme members to be compressed relative to the distance\nbetween more moderate ones. This compression favors the emergence of a\nmajority at the extreme, which then drives consensus to a policy that is more\nextreme than the mean of the initial policy distribution. For the case where the\npolicy, such as a wager or investment, arises from the subjective probability\nof an outcome in a binary gamble, Gabbay et al. (2018) show that a concave\nrhetorical function is expected using the theory of decision-making under risk\nand uncertainty (Pleskac et al. 2015).\nAs an illustration of distribution reshaping, consider a group of three\nmilitary planners in wartime tasked with deciding whether to increase or\ndecrease the size of the force allocated to defend a certain territory. The\npolicy is then the change in the number of troops, positive or negative, from\nthe current level. Take a planner\u2019s preferred force level to be a function of\ntheir estimate of the probability of an enemy offensive against this territory\nand their assessment of its worth relative to other territories. If there is\nlittle disagreement as to worth yet there is fundamental uncertainty as to\nenemy intentions, then the subjective probability of an enemy offensive is\nexpected to be the dominant source of disagreement and, hence, the rhetorical\nframe. The rhetorical function is then the transformation that maps a given\nchange in force level to the corresponding subjective probability of an enemy\noffensive. For instance, assume that the three planners are all inclined to\nboost the force level and that their respective preferences for the increase in\ntroops are (500, 1500, 2500), which are mapped by the rhetorical function\nto subjective probability estimates of (0.55, 0.65, 0.70). These values indicate\nthat the rhetorical function is nonlinear: a policy difference of 1000 between\nthe first two members corresponds to a change in probability of 0.10, while\na 1000 difference between the second and third members yields a probability\nchange of only 0.05. More specifically, it is concave in that the subjective\nprobability goes up at a slower rate as the increase in force level becomes more\nextreme. While the policy distribution consists of one member at the mean of\n1500 with the other two an equal distance below and above it, the rhetorical\nposition distribution has one member below its mean of 0.633 and two\nabove; a symmetric policy distribution has been reshaped into an asymmetric\nrhetorical one. As will be described presently, the theorized opinion change\nprocess assumes that the two more extreme members are likely to form aDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The F and U groups are seen to be homogeneous on the positive (pro)\nand negative (con) policy sides, respectively. Both groups have symmetric pol-\nicy distributions given by (x1, x2, x3) = (\u00b11, \u00b1 7, \u00b1 13) where the +(\u2212) sign\ncorresponds to the F(U) group.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The\nrhetorical position scale goes from 0 to 1 and so can correspond to the choice\nof subjective probability as rhetorical frame. Although the policy of the cen-\ntrist F2 is exactly midway between those of the moderate F1 and the extremist\nF3 , the F group members are arrayed along the shoulder of the rhetorical func-\ntion so that, with respect to the rhetorical frame, F2 is closer to F3 than to F1 ;\nthe rhetorical distance \u0394\ud835\udf0c32 is much less than \u0394\ud835\udf0c21 . As agreement is driven\nby proximity of rhetorical positions, it is therefore more likely that F2 will join\nwith F3 to form the RPM pair than with F1 . There remains the question of where\nthe RPM pair will converge. Assuming F2 and F3 have equal influence on each\nother, then they should converge at either the midpoint between their rhetorical\npositions, which is then transformed back to the corresponding policy posi-\ntion, or midway between their policies. Either choice will lead to a policy more\nextreme than the mean x2 , but the latter process is more direct than the former.\nIn addition, the policy positions are explicitly numerical, whereas the rhetorical\nones need only be expressed qualitatively. It is therefore more plausible that the\nRPM pair forms midway between their policies (at x23 = (x2 + x3)\u22152 = 10).\nThe convergence of the RPM pair on this point is indicated by the solid arrows\nleading to the open circle. As indicated by the dashed arrow, majority influ-\nence then causes F1 , now in the minority, to conform to the F2 , F3 position.\nThe result is a consensus policy that is more extreme (i.e. further from the pol-\nicy reference) than the initial policy mean \u2013 in accord with definition of group\npolarization.\nAlthough distribution reshaping due to a concave rhetorical function in com-\nbination with the RPM process can explain group polarization, it predicts only\na systematic tendency for groups to shift toward the extreme. It is clear from\nFigure 13.1 that if F2 \u2019s initial policy were moved sufficiently close to F1 , then\nthose two would form the RPM pair, which would yield a consensus policy\nbelow the mean. This ability to predict that individual groups can depolarize\nagainst an overall polarization tendency stands in contrast to standard theory\u2019s\nstrong prediction of polarization for every homogeneous group.\nNote that the references corresponding to the policy and rhetorical frame are\noffset along the horizontal axis in Figure 13.1. This misalignment between the\npolicy and rhetorical references can arise from heuristic frame substitution in\nwhich a simpler heuristic rhetorical frame is discussed in place of a more com-\nplex frame that directly corresponds to the policy. In the binary gamble context,\nsuch substitution can occur when there are two distinct gambles that depend\non the same random variable but with different thresholds: the policy gamble\nthat directly determines whether one\u2019s policy choice is successful and a heuris-\ntic gamble that is more intuitively accessible. In a stock investing scenario, for\nexample, the policy gamble could be whether or not the return of the stock over\na given period of time would exceed that of a fixed return asset such as a bond.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nIntegrated Empirical and Computational Investigation of Group Polarization 293\nIf the stock\u2019s return is greater than the bond\u2019s return, then the investment is suc-\ncessful. The proper rhetorical frame would then be the subjective probability of\nthat outcome. If it is greater than 0.5, then one should invest in the stock and not\nthe bond. However, discussions about the investment might focus on the more\nintuitive heuristic gamble of whether the stock\u2019s price will rise or fall. Both of\nthese gambles depend on the same random variable, the stock\u2019s return, but with\ndifferent thresholds \u2013 the fixed return for the policy gamble, zero for the heuris-\ntic gamble \u2013 and so they have distinct subjective probabilities. If a probability of\n0.5 is taken as the neutral reference for both subjective probabilities, then they\nwill be related to different policy reference points by the rhetorical function.\nThe U group in Figure 13.1 illustrates the effect of reference point shifting\ndue to heuristic frame substitution. The reference point of the rhetorical func-\ntion is shifted left from that of the policy itself so that the U group members,\nwho are all on the same (negative) side of the policy axis, straddle the rhetorical\nreference point (U1 is to the right, while U2 and U3 are to the left). Because they\nare arrayed along the roughly linear part of the curve, the U group members\nare subject to weak distribution reshaping. One would expect therefore that the\nU group would be less prone to polarize than the F group. Strict application of\nthe RPM process, however, would, for the case illustrated, lead to the forma-\ntion of a U2 and U3 majority as the rhetorical distance \u0394\ud835\udf0c32 is slightly less than\n\u0394\ud835\udf0c21 , which would then yield a substantial shift toward the negative extreme.\nBut a small shift in rhetorical positions due to noise or uncertainty could read-\nily flip which distance is smaller, causing the (U1 , U2 ) majority pair to form,\nwhich would lead to depolarization instead. Whether the U group will polar-\nize is consequently much harder to predict than for the F group. Considering a\npopulation of similar U groups, about equal numbers will become more mod-\nerate as become more extreme and so there will be no systematic polarization.\nIn contrast, the offset of the rhetorical reference places the F group further\nalong the shoulder and so enhances systematic polarization on the positive\npolicy side.\nAccept-Shift-Constrict Model of Opinion Dynamics\nTwo mathematical models have been presented in connection with\nframe-induced polarization theory. The RPM process described above is\nformulated as the RPM model, which determines a consensus policy by a\nweighted average of the policies of the majority of group members whose\nrhetorical positions span the least range (Gabbay et al. 2018). Network struc-\nture is accommodated by weighting policies by relative node degrees. Rather\nthan static aggregation, the second model describes the opinion change process\nover time as a result of dyadic-level interactions. This accept-shift-constrict\n(ASC) model makes two innovations beyond existing continuous opinion\nnetwork models (Gabbay forthcoming). First, it makes a distinction betweenDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Second, it incorporates a novel uncertainty reduction mechanism that\ndoes not require that node uncertainties be visible to others.\nThe ASC model assumes an underlying dyadic process in which one node\nsends a message to a receiver node in an effort to persuade the latter. The mes-\nsage can impact both the receiver node\u2019s policy and its uncertainty interval\naround that policy. Conceptually, the model proceeds in distinct accept, shift,\nand constrict phases (although all occur simultaneously in the mathematical\nformulation). The accept and shift phases occur in the equation that governs the\nrate of change of the node\u2019s policy. In the accept phase, the ASC model assumes\nthat the probability that the receiver node will accept the message as persuasive\ndecreases as a Gaussian function of the rhetorical distance between the sender\nand receiver nodes. The uncertainty of the receiver\u2019s position is taken to be the\nstandard deviation parameter in the Gaussian. If a message is accepted, then, in\nthe shift phase, the receiver shifts its policy in the direction of the sender\u2019s by an\namount proportional to their policy difference. The constrict phase is governed\nby a second equation for the rate of change of a node\u2019s uncertainty, modeling\na process in which interaction with others with close positions reduces uncer-\ntainty. If the sender\u2019s rhetorical position is within the uncertainty interval of\nthe receiver, then the receiver decreases its uncertainty but not below a cer-\ntain minimum value. Accordingly, unlike other models that involve uncertainty\ndynamics (Deffuant et al. 2002), it is the difference in (rhetorical) positions\namong dyad members rather than their difference in uncertainties that drives\nuncertainty change. The network weights in the ASC model represent the influ-\nence of one node upon another due to factors such as communication rate and\nexpertise; they need not be symmetric. The ASC model is implemented in terms\nof coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, with two equations for\neach group member, one for the policy and one for the uncertainty.\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0 0 10 20 30\nTime\n(a)\n40 50\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\nLOA \u03bb\n\u03bb1\n\u03bb2, \u03bb3\nPolicy x\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0 0 1 2 3\nTime\n(b)\n4 5\nPolicy x\nx1\nx2, x3\nx2\n0\nx3\nx1\nFigure 13.2 Evolution of policy positions and uncertainties for completely connected triad.\n(a) ASC model.

All the nodes are connected and the network weights between\nnodes are symmetric and all equal. The initial policies are set such that x2 is\ncloser to x3 than x1 . We observe that x2 and x3 form a majority and their uncer-\ntainties (\ud835\udf062 , \ud835\udf063 ) quickly reach their minimum values, while that of the minority\nmember (\ud835\udf061 ) stays at its initial value. Consequently, x1 is more open to accepting\nmessages from the majority pair than vice versa, so that x1 essentially comes up\nto the majority position, resulting in a consensus policy that is shifted upward\nfrom the mean. This ability for a majority to emerge and persist in the face of\nminority influence is a crucial part of the frame-induced mechanism of group\npolarization. This dynamic is not present in linear opinion network models\nsuch as the DeGroot, Friedkin\u2013Johnsen, and consensus protocol models. As\nshown in Figure 13.2b for the consensus protocol (also known as the Abelson\nmodel, a continuous time equivalent of the DeGroot model), no interim major-\nity emerges as all nodes converge simultaneously on the initial mean.\nExperiment and Results\nIn the experiment reported in Gabbay et al. (2018), triads of knowledgeable fans\nof the National Football League (NFL) wagered on the outcomes of upcoming\nNFL games. In accordance with standard NFL betting practice, the wager did\nnot concern simply which team would win the game but rather the margin of\nvictory. Professional oddsmakers set an expected margin of victory, known as\nthe point spread, by which the favorite team (the team deemed likely to win the\ngame) is expected to win over the underdog. A bet on the favorite is successful\nif the favorite wins by more than the spread; otherwise, a bet on the underdog\nis successful (neglecting actual practice of returning bets when the favorite\u2019s\nvictory margin equals the spread). The spread is set so as to estimate the median\nmargin of victory if the game were repeated many times and, empirically, the\nchances of favorites and underdogs with respect to the spread are effectively\nequal. As a consequence, the payoff is the same regardless of which team one\nbets on.\nSeveral days before the selected game, subjects drawn from an online labor\npool were asked in a survey to choose which team they expected to win against\nthe spread and how much they would wager from $0 to $7 on their choice.\nTriads were then assembled into online discussion groups according to three\nmanipulated variables: (i) policy side conditions of favorite or underdog cor-\nresponding to the team that all group members had chosen (there were no\ngroups of mixed team choice), (ii) disagreement level conditions of high ($7)\nand low ($3, 4, 5) corresponding to the difference between the highest and low-\nest wagers in the group, and (iii) network structure conditions of complete in\nwhich all group members could send messages to each other and chain in which\nthe intermediate wager person was the middle node and the low and high wagerDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Groups discussed the game for 20\u201330 minutes after\nwhich members selected their final individual wagers. The winnings from suc-\ncessful wagers were donated to a specified charity.\nAnalyzing only groups that made consensus wagers (the vast majority of out-\ncomes), the polarization metric is the difference between the mean post- and\npre-discussion wagers of each group. If the post-discussion mean is higher,\nthe group is said to have displayed a risky shift. Statistically significant results\nwere found for all three manipulated variables: (i) favorite groups displayed a\nlarge risky shift, whereas underdog groups showed a small shift not statistically\ndistinguishable from zero; within the favorite groups, a greater risky shift was\nobserved for (ii) high disagreement groups than low and (iii) complete networks\nthan chains.\nThese results are not readily explained by either standard polarization the-\nory or existing opinion network models. The differential polarization behavior\nin particular stands at odds with the informational and normative explanations,\nwhich predict that a risky shift should occur for both the favorite and underdog\nconditions. Since both favorite and underdog groups were homogeneous with\nrespect to policy side, group members have more novel arguments in support\nof their team choice, and so persuasive arguments theory predicts polarization\nfor both favorite and underdog groups. Similarly, given the low stakes of the\ntask, social comparison theory predicts that a norm favoring risk taking should\nbe present in both groups and so both should exhibit a risky shift. This differ-\nential polarization result is also counter to the extremist-tilting explanation of\nopinion network modeling because, presumably, a high bet on the underdog\nis equally as extreme as the same amount bet on the favorite and so the level\nof extremist tilting is the same for both sides. With respect to the results for\ndisagreement and network structure, their effects have been under-theorized\nand under-explored in the literature. The only previous experimental investi-\ngation of network structure in group polarization found no effect of topology\n(Friedkin 1999).\nThe experimental results, however, are in qualitative agreement with\nframe-induced theory. The differential polarization by policy side arises from\nheuristic frame substitution in which the question directly related to the wager\npolicy \u2013 who will beat the spread? \u2013 is replaced by the heuristic one \u2013 who will\nwin the game? The subjective probability of the favorite winning the spread is\nthe proper rhetorical frame but is replaced by the subjective probability of the\nfavorite winning the game. While professional gamblers may be able to think\ndirectly in terms of the spread victor probability, the game victor probability\nis a much more natural one for most knowledgeable fans to consider and so\nconstitutes the rhetorical frame operative in the discussion. This substitution\nalso entails a shift of reference point since both gambles depend on the same\nrandom variable, the margin of victory, but with different thresholds for their\nresolution. The reference margin of victory for the spread victor gamble is theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The rhetorical reference is obtained by considering\nthe wager for a subjective probability of the favorite winning the game equal\nto 0.5. Believing that the game is a toss-up implies that one estimates the\nmargin of victory to be zero and so one should bet on the underdog if the\noddsmakers have set a nonzero spread. Therefore, the rhetorical reference\nequates to some wager on the underdog. If positive and negative wagers are\nused to represent favorite and underdog bets, respectively, then the rhetorical\nreference corresponds to a negative wager. Accordingly, the F and U groups in\nFigure 13.1 can now be seen as analogous to the favorite and underdog groups\nin the experiment.\nThat favorite groups with high disagreement are expected to show a greater\nrisky shift is a consequence of the RPM process described in connection with\nFigure 13.1. Expanding the difference between x1 and x3 while keeping x2 fixed\nimplies that the F2 and F3 will form the RPM pair at a more extreme policy\nsince x3 is more extreme. The greater polarization for complete networks vs.\nchains is due to the greater relative communication rate of the center node in\nthe chain along with its intermediate wager. Rather than forming at their policy\nmidpoint as in the complete network, the greater influence of the chain center\nnode causes the RPM pair to form at a policy that is closer to x2 and so implies\na lesser shift to the extreme.\nAs a visual comparison between the data and models, Figure 13.3 displays\nthe observed and simulated pre- to post-discussion shifts in the group mean\nwager as a function of the wager difference (averaged over all groups at each\ndifference) where favorite and underdog groups are shown, respectively, on\nthe positive and negative sides of the horizontal axis. Groups are simulated\nusing their actual wagers and spreads. The weights in the complete and chain\nnetworks are set by a priori considerations of the topological effects upon com-\nmunication rates. In the complete network, all weights are equal, whereas the\nmiddle node in the chain has twice the weight of the end nodes (these expecta-\ntions are in approximate agreement with the measured communication rates).\nThe free parameters in the models, the level of risk aversion plus the initial and\nminimum uncertainties (for ASC), were chosen so as to minimize the total \ud835\udf122\nerror over both networks between the observed and simulated data. The data\ndisplays the observed greater polarization for favorite groups, high disagree-\nment level, and complete topology. The RPM and ASC simulations also display\nthese behaviors demonstrating qualitative agreement between the experiment\nand simulations. That the simulation results mostly pass through the error bars\nfurther suggests quantitative agreement whose testing we now discuss.\nIn general, when statistically testing the fit of a model, one assesses whether\nits predictions are consistent with the data in the sense that it is reasonably\nprobable that the model could have produced the data given the presence ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, if two models \u2013 a parameter-lean one\nand a parameter-rich one \u2013 both pass the test, one cannot claim more support\nfor one than the other on the basis of the test itself. While the parameter-lean\nmodel might be preferred by virtue of its parsimony, the parameter-rich model\nmay be preferred if it has more general scope beyond the experiment under\nstudy or if there are more grounds for its causal process in the relevant litera-\nture.\nThe RPM and ASC models were evaluated using a \ud835\udf122 goodness-of-fit test. A\n\ud835\udf122 goodness-of-fit test uses the sum of the squared errors between the observed\nand predicted data points (normalized by the variance at each point) as its test\nstatistic. A threshold of Q \u2264 0.2 was chosen for rejecting the null hypothe-\nsis that the model is correct. This threshold is conservative with respect to\nthe standard significance threshold (p-value) of 0.05 used in testing qualita-\ntive hypotheses in that a higher Q-value makes it more difficult for the model\nto pass the test. The RPM model (one free parameter) has Q = 0.61, and the\nASC model (three free parameters) yields Q = 0.3. Accordingly, both models\nwere found to be consistent with the data. On the other hand, several alterna-\ntive models, such as the median and a proximate majority model based directly\non the policy (not the rhetorical frame), did not pass. Consequently, this test\nprovides a statistical basis for rejecting these models as explanations of the\nexperimental data.\nWhile the agreement between the experiment and the models is encourag-\ning, more experimentation is needed to judge the validity of the theory. Of\ngreater relevance for present purposes is that this work illustrates some of\nthe themes of the integrated approach. First, it demonstrates that quantitative\nagreement between computational models and experiment is possible. Plots\nsuch as Figure 13.3 comparing data points with error bars against model\npredictions as a function of an independent variable are common in the\nphysical sciences, but not so in social influence research or social science more\ngenerally. The work also shows that the modeling goal of predicting outcomes\nfor groups with specific initial conditions drives a heightened concern for\nthe synthesis of concurrent effects, as done here for group polarization and\nmajority influence. This concern for synthesis can lead to a new theory, which,\nin turn, can predict fundamentally novel phenomena such as differential\npolarization due to frame substitution. In addition, the synthesis driven by\nmodeling can yield clear predictions for the effects of variables left ambiguous\nin qualitative theory, such as disagreement level and network structure.\nIntegrated Approach\nThe proliferation of opinion network modeling research that is largely\nuncoupled from empirical support may be impeding rather than advancingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Particularly in fields outside of social science\nsuch as physics, computer science, and engineering, an initial model can be\nsubjected to ever more sophisticated analysis or variation, thereby achieving\nprominence incommensurate with its level of empirical support. This prolif-\neration makes it hard for application-oriented researchers to choose among\nvarious models as model popularity need not indicate empirical validity.\nLikewise, it is difficult for prospective operational consumers of simulations\nthat incorporate opinion network models to evaluate their validity.\nFor its part, social psychology is not wanting of experimental investigation of\nsocial influence. Commonly, a new behavior is discovered experimentally and\nfurther experiments are aimed at generalizing and elaborating upon the origins\nand circumstances of its occurrence. Experiments can extend the behavior\nto new contexts and winnow down competing theoretical explanations, but\nmuch less effort is dedicated to synthesizing it with other social influence\nphenomena. This lack of synthesis hampers application to real-world contexts.\nMany experiments have been conducted on group polarization since the\n1960s, but the results have not been firmly integrated with majority influence,\nconsensus pressure, or attitude change research bearing on disagreement.\nAs applied to a natural group decision-making context for an issue with a\nsubstantial judgmental element, the normative influence theory, for example,\nwould advise identifying whether a culturally salient norm is present that\nwould push groups further to the extreme. But then, given such a norm,\nit would always predict polarization. Another example is how the hidden\nprofiles paradigm (Schulz-Hardt and Mojzisch 2012) has not been reconciled\nwith the persuasive arguments theory of group polarization: the former\nemphasizes how group discussion centers on pieces of information held in\ncommon to the detriment of the sharing of unique information held by indi-\nviduals, while the latter hinges upon group members exchanging their unique\ninformation.\nAn approach that centers on integrating experiment with the quantitative\ntesting of computational models of social influence will place models on more\nsolid empirical footing. Of particular importance to this approach are complex\nsystems models (e.g. the ASC model), in which the variables of interest, such as\ngroup member opinions, evolve from initial conditions as a result of endoge-\nnous feedback with each other and perhaps exogenous signals (Gabbay 2014).\nUnlike standard statistical models, complex systems models do not directly\nposit some generic functional form, often linear or quadratic, that expresses an\noverall relationship between independent and dependent variables. Rather, the\noverall functions relating input and output are determined by the unfolding of\nthe processes in the model and so need not result in a function that is expressed\nin a simple analytic form. However, the predicted relationship is more specific\nthan simply saying, for instance, that there is an interaction effect between vari-\nables as in regressions. That complex systems models must deal with specificDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

One can statistically analyze\nthe overall group polarization in a population of homogeneously inclined\ngroups with random initial preference distributions without worrying about\nmajority influence. Since groups with a majority preference above the mean\nwould be roughly balanced by those whose majority was below the mean,\n(preference-based) majority influence could not be the cause of any observed\nnet shift toward the extreme. However, majority influence strongly affects\nwhether a particular group will polarize or not as it can operate counter to\npolarization when a group has a majority below the mean. This implies that\nmajority influence cannot be ignored when one seeks to predict whether\nindividual groups will polarize. Moreover, the focus on making predictions for\nspecific within-group initial preference distributions, rather than over a pop-\nulation of groups with random distributions, helped spur the frame-induced\ntheory\u2019s reconceptualization of majority influence as operating over the\nrhetorical frame, thereby becoming integral to the group polarization process.\nImplementation of an integrated approach will entail changes for both\nthe experimental and modeling sides. For the former, the major change\nis that experiments will be designed from the outset with the objective of\nquantitatively testing computational models, not just qualitative hypotheses.\nFor hypothesis testing, one often coarse grains the values of an independent\nvariable in order to construct experimental cells corresponding to, say, a\nbinarization of that variable, as we did with disagreement level above. Quan-\ntitative testing of computational models, however, typically requires greater\nresolution, and experiments should be designed so that a sufficient number of\nvariable values are present to conduct a goodness-of-fit test. As complex sys-\ntems models can utilize specific experimental initial conditions for individuals\nor groups instead of treating them as random error, greater attention should\nbe given to the distribution of initial conditions in the design than is needed\nwhen the goal is simply to populate binarized condition cells. Beyond a focus\non initial and final states, the testing of complex systems models would also\nbenefit from experimental measurements over time, when such measurement\nis feasible and does not unduly interfere with the process under study.\nFor the modeling side, a greater focus on developing models capable of being\nestimated from experimental data is needed. Making quantitative contact with\nexperimental results requires more disciplined consideration of parameters\nthan when more simply endeavoring to show a qualitative correspondence\nwith the data. The temptation to develop rich models must be tempered\nagainst the need to estimate parameters from the data itself if they cannot be\nindependently determined. Discretion should be exercised when considering\nthe addition of parameters beyond those directly related to the variable ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The essential parameters in continuous opinion network\nmodels will involve distance in the opinion space.\nAnother important element is that models be capable of prediction. This\nrequires that, once parameters are estimated on an in-sample population,\nmodels are then capable of predicting cases held out of the sample or from a\nnew experiment. As noted above, the network weights in the Friedkin\u2013Johnsen\nmodel have primarily been calculated using post-discussion ratings of influence\nby the group members themselves. Such a procedure precludes prediction.\nHowever, it would be possible to test the extremist-tilting explanation of group\npolarization in conjunction with the Friedkin\u2013Johnsen model if one were to fit\nthe function relating persuasion resistance to opinion extremity.\nThe focus on a relatively tight number of parameters that can be determined\na priori or estimated from the data will make models more robust and\napplicable across experiments falling into the same broad context. A more\nambitious goal of an experimentally oriented modeling program would be to\nbridge different experimental contexts, such as problem solving, forecasting,\npolicy-making, and ideological attitudes. As an example, the distinction\nbetween intellective and judgmental tasks is an important one in group\ndecision-making. At opposite ends of the intellective\u2013judgmental spectrum,\npurely intellective tasks like math puzzles have solutions that are demonstra-\nbly correct, whereas purely judgmental tasks are matters of personal taste.\nForecasting problems, for instance, lie in between, having not only intellective\nelements that are demonstrably right or wrong, such as the record of a football\nteam or what party has the most registered voters in a given district, but\nalso judgmental ones involving the factors likely to be most important in a\nparticular circumstance, such as motivational differences between teams or\nthe impact of national-level political considerations on a local election (Kerr\nand Tindale 2011). Where a task lies on the intellective\u2013judgmental spectrum\naffects the relative importance of social influence effects such as minority or\nmajority influence. Rather than simply categorizing a context as intellective or\njudgmental and choosing a model accordingly, it would be preferable to define\na parameter that gauges the balance between intellective and judgmental\nfactors and therefore the weight of the dynamical mechanisms at play in a\ngiven context. Experiments could then test whether models integrated using\nthe parameter could successfully make predictions for various tasks along the\nintellective\u2013judgmental spectrum. As an illustration, one might conjecture\nthat with respect to group polarization, the frame-induced mechanism\nmight best suit forecasting problems, whereas political ideologies, falling\nfurther on the judgmental side, might best be modeled by extremist tilting.\nPolicy-making might fall in between the two, and a parameter reflecting that\nbalance could then be used to weight relative strengths of the frame-induced\nand extremist-tilting mechanisms.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This tendency will\nlead to models that are narrow in scope and not readily generalized to new\ncircumstances. The SDS literature suffered from this tendency, as mentioned\nabove, and never produced a compelling account of group polarization.\nHowever, the increasing prevalence of requirements among journals to make\ndata sets available may help counter the lack of convergence caused by the\ntendency to seek and emphasize the best-fitting models for experiments in\nisolation. A new model, which best accounts for the results of a particular\nexperiment, can now also be tested against data from previous experiments.\nThe growth of a norm toward testing models against new and old data will\nencourage the development of more general models.\nInitial successes in model development and testing will eventually lead to\nthe emergence of a self-sustaining research community dedicated to the inte-\ngration of modeling and experiment (an example of a new and virtuous epis-\ntemic culture as described in Chapter 2). In the short term, a comprehensive\nprogram aimed at providing experimental data to test and develop a range\nof models would help generate the nucleus of such a community as well as\nadvancing social influence research itself. The goal of the program would be\nto develop general models that integrate different social influence phenomena\nover a range of contexts rather than the current practice that investigates behav-\niors in divergent research streams. To effect such synthesis, the program could\nunfold in phases in which experiments and models initially focus on relatively\nnarrow phenomena with later phases becoming successively more integrative.\nThis would encourage the development of more general and robust models and\ncounter the tendency toward one-off model fitting. Follow-on research could\ntest the models on real-world contexts of interest. Ideally, experiments would\nbe conducted by separate teams of researchers who would then share the data\nwith modeling teams. However, as there is little tradition in social psychology\n(and social science more broadly) of publishing experimental results without\nat least some theoretical embellishment, experimental teams could be allowed\nto develop their own models or included as coauthors on initial publications\nusing their data.\nWhile the goal of quantitatively testing computational models of social influ-\nence is challenging, the rewards for doing so would be high. On a scientific level,\nit would make the study of social influence more synthetic and cumulative.\nThe bar would be raised for evaluating competing theories: a theory imple-\nmented in terms of a model that provided a quantitative account of experimen-\ntal results would be preferable to one that only provided a qualitative account.\nIn addition, the present practice of testing hypotheses experimentally based onDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Standard group polarization\ntheory, for example, only applies when all group members have common incli-\nnations. Although a more relaxed condition of most group members is often\nstated, that is too vague to enable prediction in situations where groups have\nmembers with opposing preferences. Effectively, the reference point is a wall\nbeyond which standard polarization theory is silent. By allowing for gradations\nof effects, computational models are less constrained by such ambiguous cat-\negorizations; for instance, the rhetorical reference point in the ASC model is\nsimply a parameter that affects the rhetorical distance between group mem-\nbers, a distance that can be calculated regardless of whether it spans the refer-\nence point or not. As a result, the ASC model can treat the combined F and U\ngroups in Figure 13.1, while standard theory cannot. This freedom from depen-\ndence upon categorizations implies that models can be more readily extended\nto variable and parameter regimes not yet explored experimentally. In combi-\nnation with the ability to probe the effects of nonlinear interactions via mathe-\nmatical analysis and simulation, models can therefore be used to reveal novel,\npotentially counterintuitive behaviors not anticipated by qualitative theorizing.\nGreater incentive to perform replication experiments would be another sci-\nentific benefit if experiments were to become more oriented toward computa-\ntional models. Historically, there has been little incentive for social scientists to\nperform replications of previously reported effects and for journals to publish\nthem. In the physical sciences, however, better measurements of model param-\neters, such as physical constants, are valued even if no new effect is reported, as\nsuch measurements improve the accuracy and precision of model predictions.\nSimilarly, social influence experiments aimed at testing models would yield\nimproved parameter estimation and so hold more value than merely replicating\nan effect. New experiments could repeat earlier ones but with higher resolution\nor an extended variable range, thereby enhancing the precision and robust-\nness of parameter estimates. It is also possible that systematic deviations from\nmodel predictions could be observed pointing the way toward new theory and\nmodel development. A greater ability to publish such discrepant experimental\ndata as valuable in its own right (without theoretical explanation) would there-\nfore allow social scientists to learn more from data than is presently the case.\nFundamental advances in physics have occurred because of the publication of\nexperimental findings that ran counter to accepted theoretical models. A piv-\notal event in the genesis of quantum mechanics, for example, was the discovery\nof the photoelectric effect, a phenomenon at odds with classical physics, which\nEinstein eventually explained.

It is not a call to end the traditional paradigm for the\ninvestigation of social influence. Although we have argued that the integrated\napproach will lead to new theories and discoveries, taking it further by\ndemanding that novel theories be implemented formally before experimental\ntesting would, on net, likely hamper the discovery of new behaviors, given\nthe richness of social systems. A more desirable outcome would be for the\nmodel-oriented and traditional approaches to work in tandem. The standard\ntesting of qualitative hypotheses could explore variables and effects not\nyet incorporated within quantitative models. This exploratory role would\nidentify promising areas that could benefit from modeling and facilitate model\ndevelopment by narrowing the range of viable theoretical explanations. It\nis also possible that some behaviors will not be amenable to quantitative\nmodeling and so remain in the province of qualitative theory in which mod-\neling continues to play its more usual historical role in support of hypothesis\ngeneration.\nConclusion\nMuch of the recent surge of activity in computational social science has\nrevolved around the analysis of massive amounts of data available from\nnaturally occurring activity on the Internet and social media involving large\nnetworks consisting of thousands or millions of individuals. However, such\nstudies do not shed light on the small group context, which is central to\ndecision-making in leadership groups as well as political attitude change\namong ordinary citizens. Accordingly, the agenda put forth here emphasizes\nexperiments with human subjects. Given their ability to control conditions,\nexperimental studies can more directly test opinion models than can data from\nonline networks or other observational sources. Network topology and initial\nopinion distributions can be controlled, the latter enabling testing of the core\nobjective of modeling how opinions change from their initial values, rather\nthan predicting final distributions on the basis of assumed initial conditions.\nMoreover, experimental results can provide a sounder basis for application\nof opinion network modeling to large systems.

The goal of quantitatively testing computational mod-\nels of social influence is no doubt an ambitious one. The approach advocated in\nthis chapter centers upon the conduct of experiments explicitly designed to test\nthe quantitative predictions of models rather than the standard experimental\nparadigm of testing qualitative hypotheses. Its aim is the development of mod-\nels that can account for a range of phenomena and experimental results. Ele-\nments of this approach include: exercising discipline and discrimination with\nrespect to model parameters, conducting goodness-of-fit tests, more highly\nresolved initial variable conditions, more deliberate control of initial opinion\ndistributions, measuring opinions or other variables over time, greater use of\nout-of-sample prediction, testing models on new and old data to foster model\nconvergence not proliferation, and parameterizing the nature of group tasks\nalong a spectrum rather than ambiguously assigning them to nominal cate-\ngories such as intellective or judgmental.\nWhile experimentation with human subjects is much more expensive and\nlaborious than modeling and simulation, a greater emphasis on their integra-\ntion will enhance both the influence of computational social science and the\nscience of social influence. A major advantage of this integrated approach is an\nimproved ability to synthesize different effects. Since opinion network models\nmake predictions for specific groups, they must take more serious account of\neffects concurrent to the one under study, which otherwise might be assumed\nto wash out in a population of groups. Models can synthesize multiple effects\nmore readily than combining different, often ambiguous, categorizations of\nconditions. The bar will be raised for the evaluation of rival theories with\nhigher precedence given to theories whose associated models are in quan-\ntitative accord with experiment. Stronger incentive to conduct experiments\nfor the purpose of providing better measurement or expanding the range of\nmodel variables \u2013 not just to test hypothesized relationships or competing\ntheories \u2013 will be fostered under this approach.

The growing accessibility of digital information promises\nmany exciting research opportunities for expanding the breadth and depth\nof causal analysis. For example, studies of the relationship between conflict\nand natural resource constraints can pull economic data from any number of\nonline sources (e.g. World Bank, World Trade Organization), records of violent\nincidents from event databases, political sentiments posted in online social\nmedia, in-depth interviews from refugees provided through social science\ndata exchanges or aid organizations, and even climate and water quality trends\nfrom environmental biologists, all with a few clicks of a mouse.\nHowever, exactly how to leverage this big data environment remains a\nchallenge for social scientists, who typically have two distinct methodologies\nat their disposal: quantitative and qualitative. While quantitative data-driven\napproaches to causal analysis can provide empirical insights and discover\npreviously unknown relationships, these models can be difficult to fully\nexplain or may overfit existing data sets, producing models that contain\nspurious statistical relationships that are not truly causal or are not robust to\nreal-world social variations. Adding normative theoretical causal approaches\nto data-driven analyses can help generate hypotheses and provide the neces-\nsary framing for interpreting and understanding data-driven results.

Data can provide new\navenues for discovering causal relationships or validating (and invalidating)\ncausal assumptions in many contexts, but theoretical knowledge is needed\nto make sense of possible interactions and their applicability to particular\nsituations.\nIn this chapter, we explore the nature of this combination of data-driven and\ntheory-driven approaches to causal analysis. The role each method plays in an\nanalysis depends on the research question, the goals of the analysis, and the\ntype of data available. Using these factors, we have identified two general ways\nthat data-driven and theory-driven approaches can interact with one another\nto better analyze causality in social systems: (i) existing theory describes\nrelationships that constrain or direct data-driven models, which can validate\nthese theoretical understandings, and (ii) data-driven approaches discover\nalternative relationships that can be explained by or enrich existing normative\ntheories. Within these two basic methodological approaches, there is still\nquite a bit of room for variation. To generalize this space, we have developed\na framework for constructing mixed-methods causal ensembles, leveraging\nnot only the diversity of data but also the rich diversity of methods and\ntheoretical insights that can be combined to achieve a more comprehensive\ncausal analysis. Finally, we will present four case studies based on our prior\nwork (Sliva et al. 2013; Sliva et al. 2016; Sliva et al. 2017) as examples of\ndifferent balances between data-driven and theory-driven combinations for\ncausal analysis.\nUnderstanding Causality\nBefore we explore different approaches for combining data- and theory-driven\nanalyses of causality in social systems, we first need to better understand causal-\nity and how it is explored in social science. Causality is notoriously difficult\nto analyze, a challenge amplified in complex social systems. When looking at\nphysics at a Newtonian or even quantum scale, many questions of causality are\naddressed by mathematical models that are close representatives of the under-\nlying objective truth. Reality at a larger scale, especially social systems, is much\nmore complex, making the objective truth of causal relationships and processes\ndifficult to define, observe, and measure. We have identified two major fac-\ntors contribute to this difficulty (Sliva and Neal Reilly 2014; Sliva et al. 2015;\nSliva et al. 2017): (i) the lack of a universally accepted definition of causality\nthat applies to all research questions and (ii) the complexity and uncertainty\ninherent in the social and political phenomena in question.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nUnderstanding Causality 313\nGoldthorpe (2001) identifies three possible definitions or approaches to\nworking with causality that have been prominent in social science research.\nThe simplest (and most methodologically contentious) view is causality\nas robust dependence, where causation merely refers to some amount of\nobserved association or correlation with strong predictive power. However,\nwhile prediction may be important in some contexts, this definition of causality\nis not applicable to situations where explanation, rather than forecasting, is the\ngoal \u2013 researchers can discover statistically significant causal relationships,\nbut explaining how and why these relationships develop requires additional\ntheoretical insight. Another prominent approach to causality views causation\nas consequential manipulation. That is, causation means that there are differ-\nent consequences when the causal variable is manipulated or varied (even if\nonly theoretically). In this approach, researchers verify a causal relationship\nthrough experimentation \u2013 if X is manipulated, it produces systematic effects\nin the dependent variable Y . Finally, a growing field of study views causality as\na generative process whereby the relationship between X and Y involves more\nthan just time and precedence, but is determined by some underlying social\nprocess or mechanism, which itself may be unobservable. This generative\nprocess concept of causality prevails in many fields in both the natural and\nsocial sciences, focusing on the question of how the relationship between\nvariables is actually produced, where the underlying process may consist of\nrelationships and latent variables that cannot be directly measured. The intent\nis to explain and characterize interactions instead of simply quantifying them.\nIn general, these three definitions represent increasing amounts of knowledge.\nUnderstanding a generative process implies the ability to manipulate causes\nand effects, which supports characterization of dependence.\nMany data-driven models adhere to the first definition of causality and\ndescribe relationships that are highly correlated with a strong predictive\ncomponent. For example, because causality has an inherently temporal com-\nponent \u2013 the effect does not precede the cause \u2013 techniques that exploit this can\nhelp analyze and extract causal models from time-series data. The most basic\nmodel of predictive power is simple correlation, such as the classic Pearson\ncorrelation measure; by adding a temporal offset to the correlation to mimic the\nsequencing of cause and effect, Pearson can successfully capture many causal/\npredictive relationships in time-series data. Granger causality (Granger 1969,\n1980), a technique familiar to many social science researchers, takes strong\npredictive correlation further. Granger causality was originally introduced\nfor time-series analysis in economics and assumes a temporal order of cause\nand effect and also assumes that the causal variables provide information\nabout the effect that can otherwise be unavailable.\nDynamic time warping is a similar approach that was developed by the\nauthors for reasoning over arbitrary time-series data (Myers and Rabiner\n1981; Salvador and Chan 2007). It was originally created for gait recognitionDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Convergent cross\nmapping (CCM) (Sugihara et al. 2012; Clark et al. 2015; Ye et al. 2015), a recent\nadvance in biological studies, can identify even deeper feedback relationships\namong time series, enabling scientists to model cyclic causal relationships,\nsuch as the feedback relationship between poverty and conflict known as\nthe conflict trap (Collier 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Sliva et al. 2015,\n2016) (see section \u201cChoosing Data-Driven Approaches Using Theory\u201d). These\napproaches can be very useful for identifying causal/predictive relationships\nin time-series data sets, for example, validating models relating drops in\nunemployment with successive increases in criminal activity. However, this\ntemporal data only represents a small proportion of the available social\nscience data sets \u2013 which might also include a variety of cross-sectional,\nrelational, or event-based data \u2013 and analysis methods. In addition, these\napproaches focus more on correlation and predictive power, making it\ndifficult to verify truly robust causal relationships that not only enable pre-\ndiction of a social phenomenon but suggest policy directions or possible\ninterventions.\nExperimental intervention, Goldthorpe\u2019s second definition of causality, is\nespecially difficult in social systems, where it tends to be limited by cost,\ntime, and ethical constraints. Increasingly in the social sciences, researchers\nare using natural experiments that can provide insights into causal mecha-\nnisms \u2013 such as work examining voter turnout under varying conditions of\nelectoral redistricting (Brady and McNulty 2004) or analysis of the economic\nimpact on civil conflict given the occurrence of different economic shocks\ncaused by weather or natural disasters (Miguel et al. 2004). In these situations,\nresearchers regard the subjects according to a standard of as if random\nassignment where causes are assigned randomly (or as if randomly) among the\npopulation; that is, people are not self-selecting into electoral districts or areas\nof economic shock in ways that would confound the causal analysis (Dunning\n2008, 2012). However, natural experiments, while useful in causal analysis, can\noften fall victim to the counterfactual problem \u2013 because we cannot go back\nin time and rerun history with a different set of parameters, it is impossible to\nprove in a perfectly controlled experiment that the outcome in one situation\nwould have been different if certain causal variables were changed. Many of\nthe analysis techniques used to actually assess the causal influences in these\nnatural experiments fall into either the first definition of causality previously\ndescribed or Goldthorpe\u2019s third definition, where they are used to capture\nthe complex underlying generative process by which causes produce effects,\nattempting to mitigate the counterfactual problem and moving beyond mere\ncorrelational or predictive relationships.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

One of the most\nprominent qualitative approaches to causal analysis is process tracing, whereby\nresearchers enumerate the possible causal mechanisms (i.e. processes), as well\nas the other events, actions, or intervening variables that may enable them to\ndiagnostically link the processes to the observed effects or outcomes (Bennett\nand George 1997; Bennett 2010). In one approach to process tracing, the\nresearcher tests whether the processes and lines of influence in a case match\nexisting normative theories \u2013 does the causal mechanism appear to operate as\nexpected or diverge in some way? Another approach takes a more inductive\nview, identifying potentially new causal influences indicated by the data in\nthe case study by examining the impact of different values of some potentially\ncausal factor or working backward from unexpected effects to determine\npossible causes. In both cases, process tracing looks at the data empirically\nusing a series of qualitative tests (e.g. identify variables that are necessary\nvs. sufficient for causal interactions) to confirm or reject theoretically driven\ncausal hypotheses (Bennett 2010). Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is\nanother qualitative technique designed to identify underlying causal processes\n(Ragin 1989). QCA is based on Boolean logic, looking at the possible combi-\nnations of all variables in a case and using formal logical inference (or, in more\nrecent variations, fuzzy set theory [Ragin 2009]) to determine which causal\nrelationships logically explain the observations. QCA is focused not only on\nidentifying the causal variables related to outcomes of interest but specifically\nthe combinations or sequences of variables that jointly produce some effect,\nenabling the identification of rich causal explanations.\nIn addition to these qualitative approaches, relatively recent advances in the\nuncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI) community provide computational\nmodels that also seek to represent the structure of some underlying process\nthat is responsible for generating observed outcomes, capturing the direct and\nindirect causal relationships that exist in social systems. For example, rather\nthan simply indicating that there is a statistically strong relationship between\ndata on unemployment and data on crime, these approaches will explicitly\nmodel the assumed causal chain from lack of jobs in the legitimate economy\nto unemployment to economic hardship to criminal behavior, capturing\nthe entire process that links the observed rise in unemployment with the\nsubsequent rise in crime. Unlike the causal/predictive methods described\nabove, the observational data used to construct and validate these models can\nbe nontemporal, such as survey data (e.g. household development indicators\nsurveys) or cross-sectional records (e.g. election outcomes for different\nregions) often encountered in social science research.\nGraphical probabilistic models, such as Bayesian networks (Pearl 2014), have\nprovided the foundation for work in causal analysis since Pearl\u2019s Causality:Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These models have proven\nuseful as formal tools for describing and reasoning about causality for many\nfields of inquiry (e.g. epidemiology, policy, and social sciences). Graphical\nmodels mimic naturalistic ways of thinking about causality by explicitly rep-\nresenting the structure of causal relationships. Figure 14.1 shows an example\nof a graphical model illustrating the causal links between economic factors\nand increases in criminal activity. With their basis in formal mathematics (e.g.\nprobability theory, system dynamics), these models also facilitate rigorous\nreasoning and inference; however, the intuitive graphical structure means\nthat it is often straightforward to reason visually over these graphs and make\ncomplex assessments about causal interactions in real-world situations quite\neasily and naturally, often without needing to resort to algebraic analysis. The\ngraphical model structure can be provided either by human experts or through\nautomated structure learning techniques, such as heuristic search or constraint\nsatisfaction (e.g. inductive causation, IC; [Verma and Pearl 1991] or the PC\nalgorithm [so called after the first names of the main authors, Peter Spirtes\nand Clark Glymour; Spirtes et al. 2000]). However, these automated structure\nlearning methods depend on large quantities of data from all variables in\nthe system, which in many cases may be unavailable or researchers have not\nidentified all of the necessary variables present in the system.\nMooij et al. (2016) have developed a technique for determining the direc-\ntionality of a causal relationship between only two variables that does not rely\non any additional structural knowledge, enabling structured causal analysis\nfrom more limited observational data. For example, if we know that there is\nsome causal relationship between crime and unemployment, we can determine\nthe directionality of this link simply from observational data about these two\nvariables, rather than requiring knowledge of other factors in the graph. This\napproach assumes that there is noise in any causal relationship and that by\nevaluating the effects of some standard noise models on causal relationships,\nit is possible to tease apart cause and effect in some situations.

The complex indeterminate causation in a social\nsystem can be characterized by structural and relational features that make\nit especially challenging to establish the underlying causal truth (Hoffman\net al. 2011). Structural complexity \u2013 such as a convergence of causes into\na single effect, indirect causation or influence on more direct causes, long\nchains of cause and effect, temporal discrepancies (e.g. the cause may persist\nbeyond the duration of some of its effects), and distinctions between the\nindividual and aggregate system (e.g. is social behavior an aggregation of many\nindividual behaviors, or are there higher-level social causes as well?) \u2013 make\nit extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish measurable variables and\ncontrolled, repeatable experiments (even natural experiments) to establish\nan understanding of these systems. Further relationship complexities, such\nas counter causes, enabling conditions that are not in themselves causal\n(i.e. that are necessary, but not sufficient factors for inducing some effect),\nand emergent or evolving effects, introduce an uncertainty to this complex\nenvironment that further defies precise measurement and experimentation.\nIn this complex environment, many important events are so singular they\nwill occur only once. For an extreme example, Taleb argues that some of the\nmost impactful events in history are black swans that were highly unlikely\nand not broadly anticipated (Taleb 2007), making them more amenable to\ntheory-driven qualitative analysis than any larger-scale statistical technique.\nThe wide range of methods described above \u2013 by no means an exhaustive\nlist \u2013 indicate that there is no single causality analysis technique that fully\naddresses all of the unique challenges of understanding social systems. Instead,\nsocial scientists have at their disposal a suite of both theory-driven and\ndata-driven causal/predictive analysis approaches, each with strengths and\nweaknesses. We believe the real strength of this analysis suite lies not in\nfinding the perfect technique for a particular system, but in combining these\napproaches in unique ways to produce a more comprehensive causal model\n(Sliva and Neal Reilly 2014; Sliva et al. 2015, 2016, 2017) that takes advantage\nof both theoretical and data-driven insights. The next section will explore\ndifferent methods for managing these combinations and balancing the insights\nof normative theory and available data.\nEnsembles of Causal Models\nRegardless of which view of causality they adopt, researchers share the com-\nmon goal of attempting to model or make sense of complex social systems.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, as already discussed, fully taking advantage of these\ndata sources is likely to require a hybrid approach to causality that mixes\ndata-driven and theory-driven techniques in a mixed-methods approach. At\nthe basic level, mixed-methods research is exactly what it sounds like: \u201cthe\ncombination of qualitative and quantitative approaches in the methodology of\na study\u201d (Tashakkori and Teddlie 1998). This type of reasoning is actually very\nintuitive, and in fact, these techniques occur in everyday life in news reports,\nsports coverage, documentaries, etc., where statistical trends are supported by\nindividual stories and cases (Creswell and Clark 2007). From this perspective,\nmixed-methods research is not just a way of combining analytical traditions\nbut also encompasses the idea of seeing the world in multiple ways (Creswell\nand Clark 2007). This multidimensional view of the world maps neatly onto the\nchallenge of causal analysis in social systems, where understanding causality\ncan not only use different methods to address a research question from\nmany different angles but actually requires a multiperspective approach to be\naddressed effectively.\nIn statistics and computer science, this type of model combination is known\nas ensemble reasoning. Ensemble reasoning has proven extremely useful in\nthe computational modeling and the machine learning communities to pro-\nvide capabilities beyond those provide by any individual technique. Also, when\nusing machine learning to, for instance, learn a classifier, it is possible to cre-\nate ensembles that combine various learning techniques (e.g. support vector\nmachines, neural networks, na\u00efve Bayes classifiers, combinations of decision\ntrees) \u2013 each with its own strengths and weaknesses \u2013 to provide better results\nthan any individual approach (Opitz and Maclin 1999). We extend this con-\ncept to the domain of causal reasoning to combine multiple causality analysis\ntechniques, each with strengths and weaknesses, that more thoroughly and\naccurately model causality in real-world systems. In each of these ensembles,\ntheory-driven and data-driven models can interact with each other in two ways.\nFirst, theories can propose relationships that constrain or direct data-driven\nmodels. In this situation, theories provide the initial insights for quantitative\nstudies in terms of which variables should be included in the analysis and\nthe important relationships to be modeled, including temporal sequencing of\ninteractions, identification of multiple causal pathways, and determination of\nthe best statistical approach given the characteristics of the relevant variables\n(Collier et al. 2010). Second, we can use data-driven approaches to suggest\nalternative relationships that may be explained by normative theories not\noriginally under consideration or, perhaps more importantly, can provide new\ninformation that can enrich or enhance existing theoretical assumptions.

Such explanations may point\nin the direction of future work (e.g. new data sets or variables that can be\nincorporated or related research questions that can be explored).\nWithin these two paradigms, there are many possible structures for combin-\ning multiple causal reasoning methods into ensembles and for joining multiple\nensembles into larger ensembles. We call the building blocks of our approach\ndata ensembles, chain ensembles, technique ensembles, and nested ensembles\n(Sliva et al. 2017). Figure 14.2 shows these graphically.\nData ensembles: There are qualitatively different types of causal relationships\nto reason about (e.g. causality when there are hidden variables, effects with\nmultiple causes) and qualitatively different types of available data to learn\nfrom (e.g. continuous, categorical, noisy). Just as different machine learn-\ning techniques can learn different kinds of things from different kinds of\ndata, different causal analysis techniques are needed to extract causal models\nbased on the nature of the causal relationship present and the types of avail-\nable data. For instance, Granger causality works on temporal data; process\ntracing works on nontemporal data.\nChain ensembles: Most causal analysis techniques are very specific about what\nkinds of knowledge they extract, so they need to be composed with other\nspecific approaches that perform other types of reasoning to provide the nec-\nessary analysis. For instance, correlation analysis (with appropriate human\nsupervision) can be used to find pairs of likely causal variables, but not the\ndirection of the causation. Then additive noise methods (e.g. those described\nin Mooij et al. (2016) and Peters et al. (2014)) can be used to identify the\ndirection of the causation given two causal parameters, but does not identify\nthose parameters. By combining the two, we provide the ability to find pairs\nof cause\u2013effect parameters in data.\nTechnique ensembles: There are different ways to extract similar kinds of results\nfrom similar kinds of data, combining the results in ways that produce bet-\nter results than any individual method can provide. For instance, Granger\ncausality, dynamic time warping, Pearson correlation, and offset correlation\nare all mechanisms to find possible causal links in temporal data (Sliva and\nNeal Reilly 2014; Sliva et al. 2015, 2016), though all are known to have limita-\ntions. By combining the results, we can provide an ensemble approach that\nis more accurate than any of the individual methods.\nNested ensembles: Ensemble causal analysis can enable us to combine causal\nmodels that derive from different data sources. This approach abstracts away\nfrom the raw data, which may come in a variety of forms (e.g. qualitative\nobservations, surveys, time series) that are very challenging to analyze\njointly, to identify linkages that can combine causal models from diverse\ndata sources.

We first look at technique ensembles using primarily data-driven meth-\nods, but with room for the application of theory to suggest initial variables of\ninterest and interpret the results. We next look at cases of chain ensembles,\nwhere theoretical insights direct the exploration of data or where data is used\nas input to parameterize a theoretically based model structure. Finally, we\nlook at an example of nested ensembles where data-driven and theory-driven\ncausal models interact in more complex iterative ways to form a complete\nanalysis of a social system.\nLetting the Data Speak: Additive Noise Ensembles\nOur first case study illustrates the use of a primarily data-driven technique\nensemble to assess causal relationships in nontemporal observational data. In\nthis case, we ran an experiment using a combination of several parallel addi-\ntive noise models to determine the directionality of causal relationships that\nhave been hypothesized or assumed by theory. Additive noise models (Peters\net al. 2014; Mooij et al. 2016) are a new technique in the UAI community that\ncan identify causal relationships in purely observational data, i.e. data without a\nclear temporal component. Assessing causality in observational data was previ-\nously thought to be an impossible task, but these models have shown that under\ncertain conditions, it is possible to tease out the direction of a causal interac-\ntion from this data. In an additive noise model of causality where X causes Y ,\nwe define Y as\nY = f (X) + Ey where Ey = Y \u2212 exp(Y | X) is independent of X\nIntuitively, this states that Y , the effect, is some function of the cause X with\nthe addition of a noise term E y that is independent of X, indicating that X has a\ndirect influence on the value of Y , but some amount of additive random noise\nis allowable without disrupting the causal relationship. To use these models to\nidentify causal relationships, we apply regression on Y and see if the residual\nnoise terms are independent of X. The regression method and the specific noise\nmodels can vary, as long as the noise is additive relative to f (X).\nFor this experiment, we used the CauseEffectPairs (CEP) benchmark data set\nused in previous studies (Peters et al. 2014; Mooij et al. 2016) of additive noiseDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This data consists of 99 different cause\u2013effect pairs taken\nfrom data sets from a variety of different domains (e.g. meteorology, biology,\nmedicine, engineering, economy, etc.). For example, the data contains pairs of\naltitude and temperature measurements from weather stations across Germany\n(here, altitude is clearly the cause, and temperature the effect) and pairs of\nCO 2 emissions and energy use compiled by the United Nations for 152 coun-\ntries between 1960 and 2005 (energy use is the cause of CO2 emissions). Each\ncause\u2013effect pair consists of samples of a pair of statistically dependent random\nvariables, where one variable is known to cause the other one based on experi-\nential, theoretical, or empirical knowledge, providing us with ground truth for\nevaluating the data-driven technique ensemble.\nThe ensemble approach proved very effective when dealing with this nontem-\nporal data. We implemented a variety of state-of-the-art additive noise models\nfrom Mooij et al. (2016). Using machine learning techniques, including sup-\nport vector machines, na\u00efve Bayes, and logistic regression, to learn a weighted\ncombination of these additive noise models, we created an ensemble that was\nmuch more effective at identifying causal relationships than any single model.\nIndividually, the best additive noise models were only capable of 60% accuracy\nwhen determining the direction of the cause\u2013effect pairs in the data set, while\nmost models had around a 50% accuracy rate, making them no better than flip-\nping a coin. Using our learned ensemble, this improved dramatically to around\n90% accuracy. This result indicates that an ensemble can identify important\nfeatures of a data set, such as the amount and type of noise, and determining\nwhich combination of additive noise models will be most successful.\nChoosing Data-Driven Approaches Using Theory\nIn our next case study, we developed a chain ensemble where theoretical\ninsights into a particular research question are used to constrain the data-\ndriven approaches that are applied (Sliva et al. 2015, 2016). Here, we\ndemonstrate a representative exploration of the causal/predictive relationship\nbetween poverty and conflict. A large body of literature exists that explores the\nconflict trap \u2013 the process whereby countries get stuck in a repeated pattern of\nviolent conflict and economic underdevelopment (Collier 2003). There have\nbeen several studies evaluating the causal/predictive link between these two\nfeatures using standard statistical approaches, with some finding evidence for\npoverty driving societies into conflict (Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Braithwaite\net al. 2016), while others (Djankov and Reynal-Querol 2010) indicate that civil\nconflict may be the cause of depressed economic growth.\nFor this problem, the choice of data is itself a challenge requiring theoretical\ninsights, as the complex and abstract concepts of poverty and conflict are\ndifficult to represent as measurable variables. To measure conflict we use the\nUppsala Conflict Data Program/Peace Research Institute Oslo (UCDP/PRIO)Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

To capture the\nnotion of poverty, which is not merely a measure of income, but also of relative\nwell-being, we use two variables from the World Bank World Development\nIndicators data set (World Bank 2013) \u2013 infant mortality rate, measured as\nthe number of infants per thousand live births that die each year, and gross\ndomestic product (GDP), to measure the overall level of development. We\nconsider two operationalized conflict variables from PRIO: (i) a categorical\nvariable ranging from 0 to 3 indicating the intensity of a conflict in a given\nyear and (ii) a numerical value with counts of the battle deaths due to conflict\nwithin a country. We focused on the time frame from 1960 to 2013 as both\ndata sets were more complete for this time period.\nWhile the literature has some debate about the direction of a causal relation-\nship between conflict and poverty, most work on the conflict trap implies a feed-\nback or cyclic relationship, as illustrated in Figure 14.3. Rather than attempting\nto analyze our time-series data using standard time-series analysis approaches,\nsuch as Granger causality (Granger 1969, 1980), this theoretical insight can\ndirect us to another type of causal analysis, CCM (Sugihara et al. 2012; Clark\net al. 2015; Ye et al. 2015), which was originally developed in ecological biol-\nogy to help analyze cyclic causal relationships. This method can be adapted to\nmodel social and political systems, providing a new opportunity to general-\nize cyclic causal theories. To use CCM, we assume some underlying dynamic\ngenerative process that produces the observable variables of interest, X and Y .\nThis process can be projected, or visualized, as a set of vectors for variables\nX and Y called the shadow manifolds, essentially estimating how the unob-\nservable process generates the observed values. For a time-series variable X,\nthe shadow attractor manifold M X consists of points x(t) = (X(t), (X(t \u2212 \ud835\udf0f),\nX(t \u2212 2\ud835\udf0f), \u2026, X(t \u2212 E\ud835\udf0f)) where \ud835\udf0f is a sampling time lag and E is the maximum\nmanifold dimension we want to explore. For subsets of time series X and Y\nof length L, we can construct manifolds M X and M Y , generating the struc-\ntures shown in Figure 14.4. CCM will then determine how well local neigh-\nborhoods \u2013 small regions of M X \u2013 correspond to neighborhoods in M Y . If X\nand Y are causally linked, there will be a one-to-one mapping between points\nin M X and M Y . To create this cross mapping, we use a neighborhood in M X to\npredict the values of contemporaneous points in M Y and compute the correla-\ntion \ud835\udf0c between the predicted values. If a causal relationship exists, predictions\nFigure 14.3 The hypothesized causal relationship\nbetween conflict and poverty.\nConflict PovertyDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We observed convergence in\n80% of countries in the PRIO data set, supporting the hypothesis that conflict\ncauses poverty, and 12% for poverty leading to conflict. However, these results\nmay be skewed by the countries that experienced no conflict during the time\nperiod under study. In these cases, where conflict is always zero, the underlying\ngenerative process is perfectly stable, so mappings from poverty to conflict start\noff exhibiting perfect predictability (i.e. regardless of the neighborhood in the\npoverty manifold and the amount of data, it can predict that there will always be\nzero conflict), and there is no room to illustrate the asymptotic behavior that\ndefines causal convergence in CCM. As such, this lack of convergence is not\nreally conclusive, and a cyclic relationship may still exist.\nFigure 14.5 shows an example of convergence to support the hypothesis that\nconflict causes poverty in Comoros. In this graph, we show how the ability\nto predict poverty (i.e. GDP) increases with the amount of conflict data we\nuse for this prediction; that is, each additional time point of conflict data is\nadding to our ability to predict GDP. Eventually, the predictive capability starts\nto converge toward 1 as more data is used, which is the indicator in CCM that\nthis is a causal relationship. Whereas previous investigations of the relation-\nship between conflict and poverty relied on linear models, this study leveraged\ntheory \u2013 the idea that these phenomena are mutually reinforcing rather than\nunidirectional \u2013 to help us better align the data-driven analysis techniques with\nthe data in order to answer the desired research question.\nParameterizing Theory-Driven Models Using Data\nOur next case study provides an example of a type of chain ensemble where\ndata is used to generate parameters for a theory-driven structural model of\nintergroup conflict.

An extensive empirical literature exists, which\nexamines the political, structural, and economic factors associated with the\nincidence, character, and duration of conflict between groups within a political\nentity and across political entities. Some investigators have incorporated a\nvariety of these substantive perspectives into game-theoretic frameworks. This\nline of theoretical and empirical research has yielded insights into some of the\nfactors associated with the incidence and persistence of intergroup conflict\n(see, for example, [Fearon and Laitin 1996, 2003; Gagnon 1994]). Despite this\nextensive body of work, however, uncertainty exists concerning the factors\nthat cause the persistence of intergroup conflicts in situations that are clearly\nat odds with the well-being of the respective groups of the general populations\nthat are in conflict.\nUnlike most political, structural, and economic factors associated with inter-\ngroup conflict, psychological factors are potentially far more volatile and, as\na result, potentially more likely to produce abrupt impacts on public percep-\ntions within fairly brief time spans. Research at the social psychological level\nhas found that public attitudes may be especially susceptible to change under\nconditions of threat \u2013 or perceptions of threat \u2013 from outside groups (Rosen-\nblatt et al. 1989; Greenberg et al. 1990, 1992).

Figure 14.6 shows the declining Israeli support for the peace process as\nIsraeli casualties increase, and a similar pattern is seen on the Palestinian side\nin Figure 14.7; these correlations potentially indicate a relationship between an\nincrease in perceived threat (i.e. more casualties) and the propensity to support\nmilitary conflict vs. a peace process. This research also found that support for\nmilitary operations against Israel among Palestinians doubled from 35% in a\nMay 1999 survey to 72% in a December 2000 survey, following the start of the\nSecond Intifada in late September 2000. Importantly, Palestinian casualties also\nshowed a dramatic rise following the Second Intifada.\nHowever, this data, while indicative of a potentially interesting relationship,\ncannot tell the whole story on its own. Many critical variables (e.g. competing\npolitical priorities, cultural narratives surrounding the conflict) are not cap-\ntured by comparing only public opinion and conflict-related casualties. Instead,\nthis data can be used to contribute to a theory-driven model of intergroup con-\nflict, providing concrete parameters where available to help assess and validate\nthe theoretical framework.\nWe developed an intergroup conflict model designed to incorporate the\npsychological effects of perceived threat on decision-making, without nec-\nessarily contradicting rational choice theory (Sliva et al. 2013). The model is\ndesigned to enable analysis of the degree of commitment to conflict \u2013 that is,\nsupport for continued conflict vs. negotiation \u2013 of a population under different\nconditions of perceived or real threat. This model has variables that take into\nconsideration the potential exposure to threat-related information (e.g. news\nreports about casualties), the preexisting vested interest in the conflict (e.g.\ncultural narratives or identities deeply tied to the conflict state, financial stakes\nin continued conflict, political motivations, etc.), and the different groups that\nmight be competing for decision-making control in this situation (e.g. the\nIsraeli government vs. hardline fringe elements in Parliament).\nThe model combines traditional game-theoretic concepts with mathematical\nrepresentations of the above psychological factors in a discrete dynamical sys-\ntem whose state space consists of sets of utility functions. Moving through the\nsystem is comparable with moving through a set of separate, but closely related\ngames, and in this manner the system is formulated in terms of game theory.\nActors behave according to the utility functions defined in the current state.\nFor each group, we represent a main group and a fringe group, capturing that\nthere are different levels of vested interest in an ongoing conflict even within a\ngiven side.\nUsing data-driven correlations and empirical evidence from studies, such as\nthe Israeli\u2013Palestinian examples in Figures 14.6 and 14.7, we can parameterize\nour decision model, enabling us to provide realistic values for the starting\ndegree of commitment to conflict of different main and fringe groups.

The workflow is based on a general procedure for causal analysis in\nsocial science described by Goldthorpe (2001): (i) establish a phenomenon of\ninterest, (ii) hypothesize causal relationships, and ( iii) test the hypotheses of\nthe causal process. At each step, hypotheses can be driven by either normative\ntheory or discoveries in the data but are then tested against the alternate\nknowledge source (i.e. data-driven findings are compared with theoretical\nexpectations, and theory-driven hypotheses are validated or enriched through\ndata-driven discoveries).\nTo demonstrate how ensemble models can help identify causal relationships\nto characterize social systems, we applied this approach to modeling violence\nin Iraq (Sliva et al. 2017). Currently, Iraq is plagued by continuing and increas-\ning violence from the terror organization that calls itself the Islamic State of\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL), and militant activity is growing throughout Iraq,\nSyria, and parts of Lebanon. World leaders have been debating how best to\naddress this increasing threat and stabilize the region. Many experts have\nturned to the recent past to better understand and model the present Political,\nMilitary, Economic, Social, Infrastructure, Information (PMESII) effects,\nlooking at parallels to the situation in Iraq\u2019s Anbar Province in 2006 when the\nregion was under increasing control by Al-Qaeda militants. Using a variety\nof causal analysis approaches and diverse data, we developed a rich nested\nensemble that employs data, chain, and technique ensembles to capture the\ndynamics of the situation, illustrating how decision-makers might use these\napproaches to understand a complex situation and the possible impacts of\ndifferent policy options.\nFor our analysis, we used data from the Empirical Studies of Conflict\n(ESOC) data from Princeton University (2016). ESOC contains a variety\nof different types and sources of data regarding Iraq that we used for this\nevaluation: (i) time series of violent events in Iraq yearly, monthly, and weekly\nat the province and district levels from February 2004 to February 2008 as\ncompiled from the significant activity (SIGACT) reports by coalition forces;\n(ii) time-series reconstruction data on all projects executed in the country\nfrom 2003 to 2008, including the type of project and the amount and source\nof funding; and (iii) nontemporal demographic data based on a national\ncensus in 2008. Each of these data sources can provide insight into a different\naspect of the situation in Anbar Province in 2006, capturing the militant\nactivity \u2013 particularly activity targeting the US troops \u2013 as well as sociocultural\nand sectarian issues. In addition, the choice of data for this experiment was\nitself motivated by a causal theory presented by human experts, indicating that\nthere is in fact some relationship between socioeconomic conditions and the\npropensity for violence in the region, provided that basic security issues could\nalso be provided by US military presence.

Because we have these\ndifferent types of data sources, including both temporal and nontemporal\ndata, we used a technique ensemble approach to combine additive noise\nresults and time-series analysis into a single coherent causal model. For\nintuitive analysis by policy-makers, the resulting model was represented as\na graphical model with a structure similar to Pearl\u2019s (Verma and Pearl 1991;\nPearl 2002, 2014). Given all of these factors, we constructed a complex nested\nensemble, enabling us to combine human expertise with the additive noise and\ntime-series ensembles developed for the prior two experiments in a graphical\nmodel representation.\nFigure 14.9 shows the final model that was constructed using this ensemble\nof ensembles over the ESOC data. Looking at the time series in the recon-\nstruction data and the SIGACTS data, our temporal ensemble of Granger\ncausality, offset Pearson correlation, and dynamic time warping identified\nseveral causal relationships where specific types of reconstruction projects\n(e.g. military facilities, democracy building, infrastructure improvements,\netc.) influence (either increase or decrease) the number of violent acts, or vice\nversa. From the nontemporal demographic data, the additive noise ensemble\ndiscovered causal links from the size of the Shia, Sunni, and mixed populations\nin a district to the number of SIGACTS (i.e. violence was higher in places\nMixed\npopulation\nShia\npopulation\nSunni\npopulation\nDetainee\npayments\nElectricity\ndistribution\nHealth\nprogramsPublic\nmunicipal\nbuildings\nInfrastructure\nsecurityInfrastructure\nimprovements\nDemocracy\nbuilding\nMilitary\nfacilities SIGACTS\nCivil\u2212military\nreconstruction\nspending\nFigure 14.9 Causal model of the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on\nmilitant activities in Anbar Province, extracted from real-world data and expert theoretical\nknowledge using a nested iterative ensemble.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In addition, the causal\nensemble was also able to identify specific theory-driven hypotheses that\nwere not discovered by the data-driven approach. In the structure proposed\nby human experts, reconstruction efforts targeting courts and schools were\nconsidered important factors in reducing the violence; however, subsequent\nanalysis in the ensemble by data-driven time-series methods did not support\nthis assumption. When considering the strong impact of the demographic\nconditions, the human experts concluded that the underlying security sit-\nuation in many regions was too volatile and the government too weak to\nmake these aspects of civil society impactful in this situation. Based on the\nrecommendation of the data-driven analyses, these factors were removed from\nthe final model.\nThis case study demonstrates the power of ensemble combinations for\nanalyzing causality in social systems, enabling us to combine various different\ntypes of data-driven discoveries and theoretical knowledge into a single anal-\nysis that provides richer and more accurate results than any single approach.\nBy combining causal analysis techniques, policy-makers weighing different\napproaches to a situation, such as stabilizing Anbar in 2006 or dealing with\nISIL in 2016, can employ the variety and richness of information available\nin different types of data sets, ultimately producing a model of the social\nsystem. For example, using the model in Figure 14.9, a decision-maker can\ndetermine the types of reconstruction projects that might be most influential\nfor stabilizing the region, which demographic features contribute most to\nunrest and violence, and identify new or unexpected causal linkages.\nConclusions\nSocial science provides an opportunity for researchers and policy-makers\nto gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and facilitate\ndecision-making based on causal models of social dynamics. However,\ndue to the inherent complexities of human behavior and the inability to\nconduct carefully controlled experiments in most social systems, causal\nanalysis remains extremely challenging. In this chapter, we have presented\na mixed-methods approach to combining data-driven and theory-driven\nanalysis techniques in ensembles, enabling researchers to leverage the increas-\ningly available large-scale data resources while also maintaining an ability\nfor deep understanding and causal explanation. We provided several case\nstudies that illustrate the efficacy of this mixed-methods approach, each\ndemonstratively achieved the essential ambition promised by the field of\nensemble machine learning: combinations of multiple diverse techniques\noutperforming individual approaches.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Right now billions of people are carrying cell phones,\nposting content on social media, driving smart cars, recording their steps, and\neven using smart refrigerators (Riggins and Wamba 2015). Data is being gen-\nerated at an extraordinarily fast rate, and many of our traditional methods of\nanalyzing this data face challenges.\nThe hope and promise for the social sciences is that these vast data sets will\ngive us new insight into the basic way that people interact and behave. There are\nmany different types of data that are available as part of the big data revolution.\nFirst, there is the digitization of traditional administrative data (Kitchin 2014).\nThis includes everything from income tax records to parking violation data.\nThis data has always been collected (though not always stored) but now is much\nmore amenable to analysis due to the digitization of the data and the develop-\nment of ways to get access to this data. For instance, the open government data\nmovements (Ubaldi 2013) have the stated goal of making and increasing the\namount of data available to be analyzed by private citizens. Hackathons have\nbeen one way to take advantage of this data and to create apps that the aver-\nage individual can use to make better decisions using this data (Matheus et al.\n2014). Though the use and the analysis of this data may be new and different,\nthe basic data has existed for a long time, and so this chapter will not dwell too\nmuch on this type of data.\nAnother form of big data is trace data. Trace data is the data left by an indi-\nvidual as they move through the world sometimes purposefully recording data\nabout themselves, e.g. social media data, and sometimes being unaware that\nthey are creating the data, e.g. the GPS traces stored on a user\u2019s cell phone.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

However, even if this data is nothing more than the\nsocial equivalent of the exhaust from a car\u2019s tailpipe, that still would potentially\ngive us new insights into human behavior. After all a car\u2019s exhaust if we could\ntrack it would tell us where the car is and how well the car was running. In the\nsame way, tweets from a user on Twitter may tell us where that user is (Back-\nstrom 2010) and whether or not they are mentally healthy (De Choudhury et al.\n2013). Regardless, this data is clearly valuable, since it was essentially trace data\nin the form of liking of pages that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target users\nwith political campaign ads and potentially affect the 2016 presidential elec-\ntion (Grassegger and Krogerus 2017). Since this form of data is much newer\nin the social science toolkit, I will concentrate on this form of data throughout\nthis chapter. However, many of the principles discussed apply equally well to\nadministrative data and trace data.\nThe fact that we have millions of traces of individual-level data at a time\nresolution as precise as a tenth of a second or even higher is beautiful, but it is\nalso a challenge. Never before in the history of social science have researchers\nhad access to such a wealth of data, and as a result the academic community\ndoes not really know how to process such data. There have already been a few\nmissteps. The most classic case might be Google Flu Trends, which attempted\nto predict the prevalence of flu based on examining hundreds of millions\nof Google searches (Cook et al. 2011). Flu Trends worked well for a while\nbut then started wildly over- and underpredicting the prevalence of flu. The\nGoogle Flu Trends approach, and many other approaches to big data, uses an\naveraging approach of some sort, but the true beauty of big data is the richness\nof individual-level data. Traditionally social scientists have had to depend\non samples or surveys of data (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001), but the\npresence of big data means that we have a more complete picture of individual\nbehavior than ever before. Though there is probably an optimal level of data\nresolution for any given problem, for many questions that are determined\nby individual-level heterogeneity, it would be useful to have a methodology\nthat could automatically account for the differences between individuals as\nrecorded in big data.\nWe want computer models that can be built or constructed from data.\nMany theory-driven models are never really compared to data. In other\nwords, many models have been inspired and generated from theory or\nspeculation, and therefore are somehow taken to be correct representations\nof the phenomenon at hand, but have never been shown to apply to data,\nor potentially have just been tested on some data set that also inspired the\noriginal theories, i.e. they have not been tested in an out-of-sample situation.\nCathy O\u2019Neil in her book, Weapons of Math Destruction, warns about theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, if these models have never been validated\n(Wilensky and Rand 2015), i.e. showing that they do in fact predict some\ninherent aspect of teacher performance, then these models are not valid tools\nof reasoning. As a community, we need to be able to create valid models from\nbig data.\nA modeling approach has been used in the social sciences that does give the\nresearcher the ability to account for all of the individual-level heterogeneity\nthat might be present. This approach is called agent-based modeling (ABM),\nand it is defined by creating a computational representation of every agent or\nindividual (Wilensky and Rand 2015). This gives an agent-based model (ABM)\nthe power to capture a rich variety of heterogeneity in the underlying system.\nHowever, historically many social science ABMs have been developed purely\nfrom theory, and not from data. Some of these theories have been grounded\nin pure speculation, based on casual observations and intuitions, and have\noften focused on one magical cause. Other theories have been driven by more\nin-depth thinking with at least some consideration of interactions. Still other\ntheories have initially been grounded by examining data, but no serious effort\nhas been made to test them outside of the original data. Instead, I would urge\nthe development of data-driven ABMs. There have been cases of data-driven\nABMs in the past in the social sciences (Axtell et al. 2002), but they are the\nexception rather than the rule.\nWhat if it was possible to derive an ABM directly from data? Theoretically,\nsuch a system would not suffer from the problem of being dependent on aver-\nages, since the agents would manifest the rich heterogeneity of the underlying\nindividuals. Moreover, if the system was trained using individual-level data,\nthen it would not suffer the problems that arise when a system is based solely on\naverages. In order to achieve this goal, I will begin by discussing a framework\nthat will guide the construction of big data, social science models that relies on\nthe idea that a good model needs theory, and then building on this framework\nexamine two methods for the creation of large-scale, data-driven ABMs. The\nfirst method is parameter optimization (PO), which involves taking an ABM\nand altering its parameters until the output of the model fits the data, and the\nsecond method is rule induction (RI), which involves inducing rules from big\ndata that are directly used to create an ABM.\nIn order to temper expectations, it is necessary to realize that the vision pre-\nsented in this chapter is not complete, and we do not yet have a large-scale,\ndynamically rich ABM that has been derived directly from data. However, the\ncomponents are being put together, and progress is being made. The goal of this\nchapter is not to provide the perfect solution for big data, social science models,\nbut rather to start to discuss how such models should be created and what some\nfirst steps toward their creation currently look like. Thus, this chapter is not theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It is worth noting that in many disciplines the words theory and model\nare often considered equivalent words, but in some of the social sciences, espe-\ncially the managerial sciences, there is a distinction that is often drawn between\na theory, i.e. a causal explanation, and a model, i.e. a statistical or computa-\ntional model (Shmueli 2010). I will use this distinction throughout this chapter.\nThus, model in this chapter can be read as statistical or computational model\nrelating inputs to outputs, and theory can be read as explanatory framework\nor causal theory, where such a framework could be anything from a simple\none-variable causal hypothesis to a multivariate causal theory to a procedural\ndescription that explains behavior. Regardless of its format, the theory should\nprovide some explanation of the phenomenon not just a black-box relationship\nbetween inputs and outputs.\nGiven this distinction the problem with many big data approaches is that\nwithout a theory we have not created a grounded model, but rather just a partic-\nular prediction of the future. For instance, with regards to Google Flu Trends,\nmany arguments have been advanced as to why it stopped working, but it is\nhard to assess the cause of the inaccuracies because there was never a theory as\nto why it was working in the first place beyond the idea that somehow a user\u2019s\nsearches on different subjects may be correlated with whether or not they have\nthe flu. Without a theory it is hard to justify an explanation as to why some-\nthing went wrong, since the theory provides the reason why it might work in the\nfirst place. With a theory, if something stops working, then it can be explored\nwhether (i) the theory is wrong, i.e. it has been falsified, or (ii) the assumptions\nof the theory have been violated, i.e. the theory no longer applies.\nThis problem is particularly profound in the social sciences, where the basic\nelements of the systems, i.e. humans and human-created organizations, can\nchange and adapt over time, meaning that we truly need to understand how\nthe system works and not just what the end result of the current set of inputs\nwill be. This does not mean that we need to necessarily know exactly what the-\nory best fits the data before we start building models. Sometimes the goal of\nmodeling is to generate a bunch of different models based on different theories\nand compare and contrast based on how well they fit the data or predict future\noutcomes. In fact, we may generate millions of different models, many of whichDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nA Proposed Unifying Principle for Big Data and Social Science 341\nwe are just going to discard based on fits to data, but if we have a few that actu-\nally match well with data, then we need the ability to explore those models from\na theoretical perspective. A model that is constructed in such a way that it is\nessentially a black-box model, such as many of the deep learning models that\nare popular right now (LeCun et al. 2015), cannot ever really be compared to\ntheory since there is no easy way to tell why the model is generating its results1\n(Yosinski et al. 2015).\nSometimes the distinction here is referred to as black box vs. white box.\nBlack-box models just take inputs and give outputs, while white-box models\nallow inspection to determine why they are generating the outputs. Fundamen-\ntally, this means that black-box models are usually not very useful from a social\nscience perspective, because it is hard to gather additional knowledge about\nhuman processes when it is not possible to explain how the inputs are related\nto the outputs. Moreover, a black-box model that may not be useful outside the\ndata is trained on, because it is not possible to understand under what assump-\ntions it works. This makes it difficult to determine that a black-box model that\nworks now will also work next year, which seems to have been the case in the\nGoogle Flu Trends. This is somewhat related to the Lucas critique of macroeco-\nnomics (Lucas 1976), which states that no macro-model is useful for predicting\nwhat would happen as a result of a change of macroeconomic policy since the\nmodel was trained on data where that policy was not the case. In much the same\nway, the application of a black-box model is not useful if the goal is to under-\nstand how society will respond to a change in a structural element of society,\nsince the model was not developed in a world where the structure had changed.\nThe result of all this is that we need social science models that are at least\npotentially amenable to a theoretical analysis. However, we also need theories\nthat are useful as well. Though the focus of this chapter is on models and not\ntheories, it is important to remember that a theory that does not lend itself to be\ninterpreted from the perspective of a modeling framework is also problematic,\nsince the theory is not testable. If the theory is not testable, then it has the same\nproblems that a big data-driven correlational analysis does since there is no way\nto determine why the theory does not explain a particular set of data. Given\nthese concerns, I propose the following principle for all theories and models\nthat use big data in the social sciences.\nPrinciple. Theory-Interpretable Models and Model-Interpretable Theory\n(TIMMIT) Principle: All social science models using big data should be inter-\npretable from a theoretical perspective, i.e. they should not be black box, and\nall social science theories applied to big data should be interpretable from a\nmodeling perspective, i.e. they should be falsifiable.\n1 There are recent efforts to make deep learning neural nets more understandable. This agenda is\nsometimes referred to as explainable AI.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n342 Theory-Interpretable, Data-Driven Agent-Based Modeling\nAs mentioned, this does not require that the model be built from first princi-\nples, i.e. by hand, but it does require that it is potentially possible to inspect the\nmodel and then compare the model behavior to theory. Let us examine a quick\nexample. Imagine that a researcher is trying to understand how information\nspreads on social media and they are examining Twitter. In particular, they want\nan individual-level model that predicts whether or not a focal user will retweet\na particular piece of content. They could accomplish this by gathering a bunch\nof features about the user, including all of the time series of all the users that the\nfocal users follow, and feeding this into a large wide and deep neural network.\nThe resulting model might be very predictive, but if there is no way to under-\nstand why it is making the decisions, i.e. it is not theory interpretable, that is\npotentially problematic. On the other hand, the researcher could take the same\ninputs and create a Markovian-type model from the data. Though this model\nis not necessarily developed from theory, it is possible to inspect the model\nand potentially explore why the model is producing the outputs that it is by\nexamining the states and how the user transitions through those states as time\ngoes on. Even though there was no causal theory that was used to generate this\nmodel, the model was created using a framework that enables the researcher to\nexplore each and every action that the agent in the model takes from a mech-\nanistic point of view. These mechanisms can then be compared to theory, and\nthe researcher can determine if the model makes sense from a causal theory\npoint of view. In this particular example, it turns out that many traditional the-\nories of information diffusion, such as the threshold (Granovetter and Soong\n1983) and cascade theories (Goldenberg et al. 2001), can be written in this same\nmodeling form. This means it may be possible to compare the model directly to\ntheory and see how much the fully data-driven model gains you versus a poten-\ntially more restricted theory-based model. This is what I mean by a potentially\ntheory-interpretable model.\nData-Driven Agent-Based Modeling\nSo now that we have a principle to guide our creation of social science models,\ngenerated from big data, the next question is how do we implement this prin-\nciple. In the rest of this chapter, we will explore one particular solution that\ninvolves using machine learning to take an ABM and fit it to data. There may\nvery well be other approaches that work and still meet the goals of the TIMMIT\nprinciple, but we will focus on this particular solution here. The ABM solution\nhas a number of important benefits. First, ABM is flexible, i.e. it can incorpo-\nrate many different modeling frameworks for the individual agents. Second,\nABM is interdisciplinary, i.e. it applies equally well across the spectrum of the\nsocial sciences and has been used in just about all of them. Third, ABM poten-\ntially provides an answer to the Lucas critique. If we can understand low-levelDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nData-Driven Agent-Based Modeling 343\ndecision rules that drive human behavior, then theoretically we should be able\nto explore how changes in their environment or policies affect their behavior. In\nmacroeconomics, the Lucas critique resulted in a shift of research effort within\nthat field to a better understanding of micro-foundations for the same reason.\nIf you can understand the micro-principles, then even if you change the world,\nthe model should adapt appropriately. This does not guarantee that the model\nwill be correct, since it may still be the case that some hidden variables were\nnot included in the model, but it is closer to building a correct model.\nWithin the space of machine learning and ABM, we will examine two\ndifferent approaches to developing an ABM that fits to data and is theoretically\ninterpretable: (i) PO and (ii) RI. PO starts with a theoretically grounded\nmodel and then modifies the parameters of the model until the output of the\nmodel matches some empirical data set (Bonabeau 2002). RI, on the other\nhand, attempts to induce rules of behavior directly and then asks whether the\ncombined output of all of the agents acting together matches the empirical\ndata. We will explore each of these approaches in turn.\nParameter Optimization\nPO has been around since at least the first computer simulations, and even the\nuse of machine learning to optimize parameters (Weinberg and Berkus 1971)\nhas been studied for some time. The basic method for PO is that the researcher\nfirst constructs an ABM based on first principles and theory and then does\ntheir best to manually match the parameters to measured data about the world\nbased on previous research, a process, which is sometimes called input valida-\ntion (Rand and Rust 2011). However, it is usually the case that there is some\nuncertainty or unknown aspects to these parameters (Smith and Rand 2018).\nGiven that, and if the goal of the simulation enterprise is to create a model that\nis descriptive and potentially predictive of the real world, one way to choose a\nfinal set of parameters is to compare the output of the model to an empirical\ndata set and then tune the parameters until the model output and the real-world\ndata are in close alignment.\nIn previous work, with Forrest Stonedahl, we described this more formally\n(Stonedahl and Rand 2014). We start by assuming a real-world data set, R,\nand a model, M(P, E), with parameters, P, and environmental variables, E.\nThe parameters, P, are the input values to the model that we do not know\nand are trying to optimize. Though we discuss this in the context of finding\nparticular point values for P, it could also be that P is a set of distributions\nor even a choice of behaviors. The environmental variables, E, are the input\nvariables that vary from particular context to particular context, and are not\nbeing optimized. For instance, they could be the input variables that control\nthe geography the model is operating in. Given this notation, we can formalize\nPO in the following way. We split R into data sets: Rtrain that is the data set weDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The environmental variables may differ between these\ntwo data sets, so we can denote them Etrain and Etest . Given this notation, we\ncan start the PO process by calibrating on the training data, which is simply\na matter of identifying a set of parameter, P\u2217, such that some error measure\n\ud835\udf16(Rtrain, M(P\u2217, Etrain)).2 This becomes a search problem to some extent, and any\nnumber of machine learning methods can be employed to optimize the system.\nOnce the model has been calibrated, we can then determine if the model is\nvalid by computing \ud835\udf16(Rtest, M(P\u2217, Etest)). If this value is less than some threshold\nT, then we can say that model has been validated. This approach is illustrated\nin Figure 15.1.\nThis provides a general framework by which an ABM that is driven by theory\ncan be compared to and calibrated by big data. One way to use this frame-\nwork would be to exactly find the best P values to match the underlying data as\nwell as possible. However, it would also be possible to adjust what was within\nP and how \ud835\udf16 was defined to instead explore both an estimate of the mean val-\nues and the uncertainty ranges around those values. Moreover, this framework\nenables the comparison of multiple models that have been generated from the-\nory. For instance, if we have two models constructed from competing theories,\nsay, M1 and M2 , we can use the above procedure to calibrate each model to data\nand then examine the resulting parameter sets, P\u2217\n1 and P\u2217\n2 , as well as the min-\nimal error that is achievable given the model and the error measure.

It could also be the case that one of the parameter sets is very different\nfrom the other one, but not enough is known about the real world to adjudicate\nthe distinction. This could be used as fodder for additional research into this\narea and helps isolate the distinction between the models.\nFinally, it is possible that both models fit the data very well, and there is not\nmuch difference between the parameter sets. In this case, there are a number\nof possibilities: (i) the training and testing data is not sufficiently large enough\nto explore the differences in the model, and more data is needed; (ii) the envi-\nronmental parameters might not be sufficiently varied to illustrate the differ-\nences between the models, and additional circumstances should be examined;\nor (iii) the models are both potentially good explanations of the underlying phe-\nnomenon, and it is necessary to reassess the differences between the models\nand see if the differences really are that significant.\nThis is an abstract explanation of how to use big data to drive the calibration\nand construction of an ABM. In the next two subsections, we will explore two\nspecific examples. The first is in the context of examining a news consump-\ntion model, and the second is in the context of calibrating an ABM of urgent\ndiffusion on social media.\nNews Consumption\nThis example is primarily drawn from previous work that developed the PO\nframework (Stonedahl and Rand 2014). The Internet is quickly and dramati-\ncally changing a number of different industries. One industry that has been\nparticularly hard-hit by the rampant growth of the Internet is the news indus-\ntry. However, news is considered more vital than ever to a well-functioning\ndemocracy. Well before the current #fakenews cycle, we investigated this\nphenomenon using an ABM. There is a desire by a number of individuals to\nfigure out a way to remonetize news (Schmidt 2009), but to do so we need\nan understanding of what kinds of revenue platforms would work online.\nFortunately, the takeover of the news industry by the Internet has resulted\nin huge, large, and at times nearly unmanageable trace of how individuals\nare consuming news. This data is eminently trackable, but researchers do not\nreally have a good understanding of how people consume news online, which\nprevents the analysis of revenue models. In order to start to solve this problem,\nit would be useful to first construct an ABM that represents user behavior.\nThe goal of this project was therefore to create a model that matches the data\npatterns as close as possible.

This data contained 90 000 users during the\nentire year of 2007. In order to organize the data in a proper framework, we\ntook one month of data (January) to use for training and one month of data\n(December) to use for testing. We also filtered the data to only contain clicks\non news-oriented websites, e.g. cnn.com and nytimes.com. We also recorded\nall of the incoming traffic to these websites. We created a network by linking\nnodes that individuals had clicked from and to. This resulted in a network of\n422 nodes in January and 417 nodes in December. The network is visualized in\nFigure 15.2.\nWe then built an ABM in NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) where we constructed\na representative average Internet surfer who started at a random node in the\nnetwork and then would decide which node to click on or to end its Internet\nsession. The hypothesis is that users decide to click on different nodes based\non their reputation and that the reputation of the node can be proxied by\nvarious network properties of the node. Therefore, the way the user decides\nwhich node to click on was decided based on a utility function where theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In this case the answer to this\nquestion would provide us with a potential explanation of the underlying user\nchoices observed even if it did not provide us with a causal theory.\nThe weights that were associated with each of these 11 measures were the\nvariables of concern. In addition to the weights of these 11 utility components,\nthere were two additional parameters. The first parameter, random-restart,\ncontrolled how often the model restarted, i.e. it was a probability that the\nuser restarted their search at any node. The second parameter, no-backtrack,\nwas a Boolean flag that controlled whether the user was allowed to go back\nto the node they had just visited. Essentially, the model was run with a set of\n13 different parameters for each of these variables for a number of user visits\nequivalent to the number of user visits observed in the actual data, and then\nthe number of clicks on each website node was recorded. This distribution\nof website traffic was then compared with the actual website traffic using\na number of different error measures, including correlation and a number\nof different L-norms, which included a right or wrong distance measure,\nEuclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and the L\u221e-norm (Stonedahl and\nRand 2014). The model was trained on the January data, and then the results\nwere evaluated on the December data.\nThis can be placed into the PO framework. The real-world data set R is the\nwhole set of clickstream data. The model, M(P, E), is the ABM, where P is the\nset of 11 parameters describing the agent\u2019s utility function and the two addi-\ntional parameters and E is the number of clicks observed in the corresponding\nset of data; this varies slightly between the January and December data. Rtrain is\nthe January data set, and Rtest is the December data set. The error measure, \ud835\udf16, is\nthe corresponding set of measures, corr, L0, L1, L2, and L\u221e. The model was then\ncalibrated on the January data (Rtrain ) using the BehaviorSearch package in Net-\nLogo (Stonedahl and Wilensky 2010) using a genetic algorithm (Holland 1975).\nIn this discussion rather than exploring the actual model implications for\nnews consumption, since those results were largely inconclusive, let us concen-\ntrate on the methodological results, which directly bear on this chapter\u2019s goal\nof exploring the utility of PO. One central question was whether one of the\nerror functions that was used to train the model would be superior to the otherDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For instance, would using the correlation-based error measure\nalso optimize the L1 (Manhattan) error measure or some other error measure?\nThree clear findings stood out. First, all of the error measures achieved similar\nperformance on the testing data for the L0 (the number of matching elements)\nerror measure, which means if this measure is a goal, the choice of how you\ntrain the model is largely irrelevant. Second, the correlation error measure was\npretty good at optimizing its own measures on the testing data set, and did\nokay on the other error measures, but none of the other error measures did a\nvery good job of achieving high performance on the correlation measure in the\ntesting data. Finally, the L2 (Euclidean) measure actually achieved high perfor-\nmance on the L1 , L2 , and L\u221e measures, meaning that it is a potentially robust\nerror measure that should be considered more in the future, but none of the\nmeasures was strictly dominant.\nUrgent Diffusion\nThe study of news consumption essentially resulted in a finding that was\nmethodologically relevant, but did not have much practitioner value. In a\ndifferent study, we focused more on the practical applications of calibrating\nan ABM to data (Yoo et al. 2016). In this study, we examined the role of\nsocial media in spreading information about disasters. An area of information\ndiffusion is called urgent diffusion (Rand et al. 2015), since unlike traditional\ninformation diffusion, there is a time-critical nature to the diffusion process.\nThe fundamental question of interest was: how can humanitarian organi-\nzations use social media to spread information better in urgent diffusion\nscenarios, such as those that occur during disasters?\nWe did this by first modeling the process of diffusion using a standard\nimplementation of an agent-based information diffusion model, namely, the\nindependent cascade model (Goldenberg et al. 2001). This model has two\nparameters, an internal influence parameter q (governing how quickly infor-\nmation spreads within the social media platform) and an external influence\nparameter p (governing how external sources of information influence the\nspread of information). We also constructed a social media network that was\nbased on the longest observed cascade (i.e. series of retweets) observed in the\nactual data. Once we had constructed this model, we then calibrated the model\nto a number of different diffusions that had been observed in social media\ndata. However, unlike the news consumption model, we were not interested in\ncreating a predictive model, but rather in creating the best descriptive model\nthat we could from the data. As a result, we did not separate into training and\ntesting data, but instead merely fit the model as best as possible to all of the\ndata. This is because we were actually going to use inferred values from the\nmodel as the dependent variable for another model, and so validation of the\npredictive capability of this model was not relevant (Shmueli 2010).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nData-Driven Agent-Based Modeling 349\nAs a result, though the purpose is slightly different, we can still place this\nmodel in the PO framework. The real-world data set R is the set of different\ndiffusion patterns on Twitter, essentially being a set of time series where each\npoint of time was the number of new people who had tweeted about the dis-\naster. The model, M(P, E), is the ABM, where P is the two parameters p and q,\ndescribing the agent\u2019s influence function, and E was the observed social media\nnetwork. The error measure, \ud835\udf16, was mean average precision error, or MAPE,\nwhich was a measure of how different the observed time series was from the\nmodel time series. The model was then calibrated using all of the data in R\nusing the BehaviorSearch package in NetLogo (Stonedahl and Wilensky 2010)\nusing a simulated annealing algorithm (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983).\nIn the end, the goal with this chapter was to identify the p and the q values\nthat were most likely have given rise to the observed diffusion patterns. Once\nthese were identified the ratio of the two values q\np was used to express how\nmuch social media affected the diffusion. We could then regress properties of\nthe diffusion process to identify factors that led to high rates of social media\ndiffusion. Our results indicated that diffusion events were more likely to spread\nquickly on social media if (i) they were started by influential individuals, (ii) they\nwere posted earlier in the overall timeline of the disaster, and (iii) the original\ninformation was posted repeatedly over time. These are all actionable items\nfrom the perspective of a humanitarian organization. However, interestingly we\nalso found that fake news was more likely to spread on social media and that\ndiffusion events containing content that promoted situational awareness (i.e.\ninformation about what is going on in the environment) did not significantly\naffect the spread of news.\nRule Induction\nRI is not as old an idea as PO, but it has been explored in the past. The basic\nidea is that rather than trying to construct the rules that an agent will follow\nfrom scratch, the modeler tries to infer rules of behavior directly from data. To\nsome extent this could be used as a large-scale form of PO. Where PO attempts\nto alter and tweak the parameters of a system to get it to fit better, the goal of\nRI is to identify the best rule that fits the data. However, there is a significant\nqualitative difference. The focus in most PO is altering micro-level, meso-level,\nor even macro-level parameters of the system to get macro-level model outputs\nthat correspond well with actual data. However, in the RI context the goal is to\nstart with empirical data at the micro level and then develop the best agent\nrules that match that real-world data. In other words, PO starts with altering\nmicro-parameters to generate macro-patterns that match macro-level data. RI\nworks by starting with micro-level data and then generating rules that create\nmacro-level patterns. As a result, both the types of data (micro vs. macro) areDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

(2008) to investigate the use of public transportation by commuters in\nthe Chicago area. In this context, they were interested in investigating how\ndifferent public policies would affect the decision by commuters to use one\nparticular mode of transit over another. In particular, is it possible to reverse\nthe trend toward car dependence in a large city?\nIn order to carry out this investigation, they created a synthetic population\nbased on statistics of Chicago\u2019s actual population. All agents then had to make\ntwo decisions: (i) transit mode choice, i.e. do they use public transit or drive a\nprivate car?, and (ii) are they happy with their current residential location, or\nshould they move? For the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on the first\ndecision, because they used a machine learning approach known as (class asso-\nciation rules) CAR to derive the rules of behavior for agents with regard to tran-\nsit mode choice. They attempted to identify one of five modes of transportation\nthat an agent might use to get to work: (i) walking, (ii) driving, (iii) passenger\nin a private car, (iv) transit that had to be driven to, and (v) transit that did\nnot have to be driven to. The CAR then used a number of different features to\nmake this decision: household income, household size, number of vehicles in\nthe household, age, gender, employment status, total travel time, access time\nto public transit, number of public transit transfers required, distance from\nwork, and whether work was located in the central business district. All of this\ndata was derived from actual data about real commuters that were part of the\nChicago Area Transportation Survey. This resulted in 404 rules that were then\nembedded into each agent. The overall structure of this approach is illustrated\nin Figure 15.3.\nIt should be noted that this process is almost a mini-calibration exercise in\nthat the rules of behavior were calibrated to real-life behavior, and in fact a\ntraining and testing approach was used in order to determine the best rules\nto use.\nThe interesting result of this approach is that agents can now make decisions\ncontingent upon their situation. For instance, in this work, Lu et al. took the\nfully calibrated model and then asked what would happen if you changed the\ndistribution of residential locations and the location of transit options. Since\nthe agent rules were calibrated at the agent level and not at the aggregate level,\nit was possible to observe how changes in the underlying population and urban\nform affected agent decisions without having to actually build the city where\nthose patterns existed, creating the possibility for a policy flight simulator\n(Holland 1992; Sterman 2001).

In some cases, it may be neces-\nsary to create not just different actions for each agent to take, but also different\nrules of behavior that govern those actions. In these cases it may make sense to\nlearn the behavior of every individual directly from the observable data. This\napproach would require a large amount of data for every individual and so may\nnot be practical in many cases. For instance, in the commuting mode choice\nexample, it would take a long time to accumulate enough data to determine\nhow each individual chooses different modes of commuting and, in some cases,\nmay not even be practical since you cannot easily alter the income an individual\nhas and then observe how that affects their behavior.\nHowever, in other circumstances it may well be that it is possible to get large\namounts of data about the way an individual makes decisions in a limited con-\ntext. In fact, in the case of the explosion of big data, that is often what we have.\nWe have large-scale trace of individuals using apps, devices connected to the\nInternet of things, social media, and websites. In these situations we can build\nmodels of the individual\u2019s interaction with these platforms at the individual\nlevel, and then we can embed these individual-level models in an ABM and\nobserve the interactions between them.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n352 Theory-Interpretable, Data-Driven Agent-Based Modeling\nWe did this recently (Darmon et al. 2013; Harada et al. 2015; Ariyaratne 2016)\nusing a technique known as causal state modeling (CSM). For the purposes\nof this discussion, the CSM approach, also called computational mechanics or\n\ud835\udf16-machine approach, creates a hidden Markov model-like representation of a\ntime series that is minimally complex and maximally predictive, i.e. has the\nfewest number of states necessary to predict the time series as well as possi-\nble (Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001). In each of the chapters where we used this\napproach, we took Twitter data and inferred a model of behavior for the indi-\nvidual users of Twitter. The complexity of these models varied substantially.\nIn one case, 12.8% of the inferred models had one state, 58.8% had two states,\n4.4% had three states, 3.3% had four states, and 20.7% had more than four states\n(Darmon et al. 2013). This indicates that the heterogeneity of the underlying\npopulation was substantial. The four most common structures that we observed\nare illustrated in Figure 15.4.\nOnce we built these models, we were able to predict whether or not a user\nwould tweet in the near future fairly accurately based on these models. We\ncompared the use of CSMs with echo state networks, a recurrent neural\nnetwork architecture, and found that the model performed fairly similarly at\npredicting the behavior of an individual (Darmon et al. 2013).

In fact, we performed as well\nas an aggregate-level autoregressive moving average model and outperformed\na pure seasonality model. This last result is interesting, because our model was\nnever trained to perform well at the aggregate level, but rather it was trained\nat the individual level, and the aggregate-level results are a by-product of the\nagent-based approach (Harada et al. 2015).\nOne of the reasons why we have chosen to use CSMs as opposed to neu-\nral network architectures or some other data mining approaches is that causal\nstate models are potentially interpretable. By that we mean that once the CSM\nis learned, a practitioner could interpret the states of the model and label them.\nThis enables comparison to social science theory about how users will behave.\nIn one case it was pretty clear that over half of the users of Twitter had an active\nand passive state, which corresponds to the idea that users are either actively\nengaged with Twitter or have stepped away from their phone or the app. More-\nover, we can also retroactively generate explanations for why the model makes\nthe prediction that it does, which is contrary to a black-box model where it\nis difficult to interrogate the model. This transparency of the model gives it a\nquality that is necessary when pursuing social science explanations and not just\ncurve fitting.\nHowever, there is still work to do in this space. So far the models we have con-\nstructed that have been successful have been stand-alone agent models where\nthere was minimal to no interaction between the agents. When we attempted\nto construct a model where there was social interaction between the agents, we\nfound that the system performed adequately for a few minutes but then stopped\npredicting the overall state of the system accurately (Ariyaratne 2016). We feel\nthat this is because over long periods of time, seasonality effects have a large\nrole in interactions, and the framework that we constructed did not account\nfor this. Nonetheless, we feel that the CSM approach can be adapted to take a\nclock as an input that would account for seasonality.\nConclusion and the Vision\nABM and large-scale individual-level data are a great match. The data can\nprovide the insight we need to generate individual-level models of human\nbehavior. This should never be an exercise in curve fitting, since if it is, the\nindividual-level models will probably do no better than the aggregate models.\nInstead, big data and ABMs should be combined under the TIMMIT principle,\nand the models should be theory interpretable, and the theories should be\nmodel interpretable. This enables the creation of models that are constantly\nbeing validated by comparing them with real-world data.

Thus, the\npromise of data-driven ABM provides one of the few approaches that may\nactually work for examining individual responses to new incentive structures\nimposed by macroscopic policy changes.\nIn this chapter, I have presented two basic concepts of how this could be done.\nOne approach involves taking a model completely developed from theory and\nthen calibrating it to fit real-world data, i.e. PO. The other approach involves\ntaking a set of data and inferring rules of behavior for that data, often informed\nby theory development and compared with theoretical models, i.e. RI. I have\nhighlighted two examples of each approach that seem to work very well, but\nthere are many other ways that these processes can be carried out using addi-\ntional machine learning or statistical inference approaches. Many of them have\nbeen explored in previous work (Zhang et al. 2016).\nOne vision for this work would be the eventual creation of an ABM directly\nfrom data. Especially, in the context of the RI approach, it might be possible\nto specify some basic features with relation to the basic form of an ABM and\nthen give a set of data to a computational data processing pipeline and have\nthat pipeline automatically spit out a fully realized ABM in a common model-\ning language, such as NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) or Repast (North et al. 2006).\nMoreover, this model could be updated on a continuous basis without much\nadditional effort by continuing to feed new data into it, creating a dynamically\ncreated realistic model of a complex system.\nFor instance, imagine an ABM of a city or urban landscape that was con-\nstantly fed data from social media, e.g. Twitter, administrative data feeds, e.g.\npolice feeds, and satellite or aerial imagery. This model might adequately rep-\nresent the focal city at enough level of detail that it could then be used as a\npolicy flight simulator (Holland 1992; Sterman 2001) and used to assess the\neffect of street closures, new crime policies, and changes in the zoning laws.\nIn fact, if carried to the extreme, and developed at the right resolution, such a\nmodel might enable detailed predictions about the future state of our fictional\nurban center. This could lead to the creation of a new science, such as Asimov\u2019s\npsychohistory, where history, psychology, and mathematical statistics (or in this\ncase ABM) are combined to make predictions about how large populations will\nact in the future (Asimov 1951).\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank all of my coauthors and the researchers who worked on the\nprojects showcased above, especially, Forrest Stonedahl, Uri Wilensky, EunaeDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, a critical weakness of laboratory-based studies is\nthat they are rarely representative of the real-world environments and sce-\nnarios faced by those whose behavior is to be influenced (Cook and Campbell\n1979; Dhami et al. 2004; Fiedler 2017). This raises serious questions about both\ncausality and generalizability. This chapter describes a new paradigm and how\nto exploit it.\nThe basic idea is to design virtual experiments that are more representative\nof real-world challenges faced by those whose behavior is to be influenced. The\nresults from such experiments about the ability to influence behaviors can yield\ncausal inferences generalizable for use in computational models. We illustrate\nthe process and challenges of doing so for three domains: preventing disease,\nmitigating harm during crises and disasters, and reducing terrorism.\nToday\u2019s technologies (e.g. virtual environments and games, ecological\nmomentary assessments (EMAs), and intelligent agents) allow us to create\nand validate the representative environments in question. These can provide\nartificial but sound default control groups. Representative environments can\nalso provide a foundation for experimental studies: that is, using the default\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

That is, the approach can provide generalizable testbeds for examining\nand validating cause\u2013effect relationships in representatively designed scenar-\nios pertaining to social domains of interest. In this chapter we draw on our\nown research experience with virtual representative designs to illustrate the\nideas; we then discuss how such research can be extended to other domains\nwith important public health and national security implications.\nSocial Domains of Interest\nIn the United States, many thousands of premature deaths annually result\nfrom unhealthy and/or risky behaviors, failure to adopt safety precautions in\nenvironmental crises/disasters, and acts of terrorism (U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention 2017). Below, we provide an overview of these three\npressing issues, considering the challenges these contexts pose for research\nthat attempts to untangle cause\u2013effect relationships and suggest effective\ninterventions.\nPreventing Disease\nIn the United States alone, at least 35% of 900 000 annual premature deaths\nare preventable with changes in individual-level decision-making (e.g. diet,\nphysical activity, substance use, safety precautions, sexual behavior) (US\nNational Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2015). Meta-analyses\nsuggest that behavioral interventions can reduce premature death by causing\nrelated changes in individual behavior (Lussier et al. 2006; Dutra et al. 2008;\nHead et al. 2013). Further, behavioral interventions prompting problem-solving\nbehaviors in response to challenges in everyday life can increase healthy behav-\nior (Lara et al. 2014). Such interventions can be accomplished in the laboratory\nwith so-called serious games (i.e. videogames dealing with real-world scenarios\nand health outcomes) (Baranowski et al. 2008, 2011). Although exceptions\nexist, relatively few existing serious games create environments representative\nof real-world challenges and scenarios and, at the same time, allow substantial\nvariation. Recreational games can in some respects be quite realistic, but are\nnot designed for the purpose of analysis and only allow for some kinds of\nmanipulation (see other papers in this volume, Lakkaraju et al. (2019) and\nGuarino et al. (2019)).\nIndividuals at risk for one health behavior may be at risk for other behaviors\ndue to common underlying variables. We need to better understand common\ncausal factors that, if prevented, can mitigate risk behaviors that have broad\nsocial implications. One such underlying variable is emotional regulation \u2013\nskills and competencies that allow individuals to adapt to stressors and chal-\nlenges (Thompson 1994; Gross 1998; Eisenberg 2000). Enhancing the emotionalDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nSocial Domains of Interest 361\nskills of at-risk individuals could have positive downstream consequences. For\nexample, one affective factor affecting emotional regulation is shame, a painful\nfeeling that results from believing that one\u2019s situation is stable (unchangeable)\nand global (due to one\u2019s self as a whole, that is, that one is a bad person)\n(Tracy and Robins 2004, 2006) and has failed to live up to one\u2019s ideal self\n(Lazarus 1991). Shame is caused by experiencing and internalizing stigma\n(Hatzenbuehler et al. 2012). Shame and stigma are related to risk behavior\nin many health and mental health domains (Hatzenbuehler et al. 2012). Can\nshame be reduced and does that reduce risky behavior? Initial work is promis-\ning in this regard: sexual shame can be reduced with correspondingly reduced\nrisky sexual behavior of men who have sex with men (MSM) (Christensen\net al. 2013).\nHarm Mitigation in Crises\nNext consider how risky decision-making manifests in crisis situations, poten-\ntially putting individuals, groups, and communities more broadly in harm\u2019s\nway. Mitigating loss of life due to such man-made or environmental crises\nas pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, or flood preparation often depends\non individual behavior. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) released mitigation guidelines to mitigate influenza\neffects in the United States (Qualls et al. 2017). The guidelines rely heavily on\npersonal protective measures (e.g. hand hygiene, voluntary home isolation)\nand additional measures during pandemics (e.g. face masks, quarantines). As\nanother example, 45 states and territories in the United States are at some risk\nfor earthquakes (American Red Cross 2017). In cases of severe earthquakes,\nindividual preparations such as taking steps to avoid gas explosions, bolting\ndown furniture, and storing adequate post-quake supplies could dramatically\nmitigate loss of life and injuries.\nIndividual behaviors differ significantly on such matters. In documented dis-\naster cases, some individuals actually traveled into not away from risk zones,\nperhaps to learn what was happening (Drabek 1969). After warning of a real\ntsunami, 15% of individuals moved toward rather than away from risk zones\n(Helton et al. 2013). Similarly, people vary on whether they do or do not leave\nan earthquake-affected city (Helton et al. 2013). Computational models and\nagent-based simulations of disaster responses should reflect this heterogeneity\n(Chien and Korikanthimath 2007).\nAmong the reasons for heterogeneity is that some individuals panic or\notherwise respond irrationally in crisis situations (Walters and Hornig 1993),\nare driven by personal beliefs or motives (Drabek 2013), or have differential\nthresholds for perceiving threats (Helton et al. 2013). Other reasons include\ndiversity of personal histories and related differences in how crisis-time cues\nactivate goals and emotions.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Individuals may not have thought through or experienced what\nmight happen in an emergency or experienced lifelike simulations. Thus,\nthe crisis-time cues may not activate those emotional, cognitive, and social\nprocesses that lead to preventative actions. If so, perhaps fear coupled with\nplans and capabilities for action in a broader social context would motivate\nbetter individual preparation (Becker et al. 2012). Virtual games might be ideal\nfor enhancing such sensitivities and propensity to prepare for emergencies.\nIndeed, some such training interventions exist (e.g. serious games for crisis\nmanagement). These, however, tend to focus on emergency response person-\nnel. Further, their effectiveness has not typically been evaluated carefully with\ncontrolled trials (Di Loreto et al. 2012).\nTerrorism Reduction and Lone Actors\nAlthough Al-Qaeda\u2019s attack on 9/11 was obviously planned, since 2006 lone\nactors have caused 98% (156) of the terrorist deaths in the United States (Insti-\ntute for Economics and Peace 2016). This domestic terrorism (i.e. involving\ncitizens or legal permanent residents, many entering the United States as chil-\ndren) is a home-grown, preventable phenomenon (Nowrasteh 2016). Another\nform of terrorism involves school shooters: this century, there have been 211\nschool shootings, including one in January 2018 resulting in the deaths of 2\nstudents and an additional 18 individuals injured (CNN and Yan et al. 2018).\nAs we were revising the current chapter, an additional school-shooter incident\ntook place in Parkland, Florida, further increasing the number of school-related\nincidents involving death and injury.\nExisting research offers insight into how to approach the problem of domes-\ntic terrorism. First, radicalization of opinions appears quite different from\nradicalization of behavior. Only 1% of people with radicalized ideas act on\nthose ideas, and those whose behaviors become radicalized do not typically\nradicalize their opinions. This puts a premium on the pyramids and processes\nand cues associated with escalation of radicalized behaviors (McCauley\nand Moskalenko 2017). Regarding radicalization of behavior, one key set of\ncontextual factors involves humiliation, a combination of shame and anger. In\na related domain, among criminals, guilt and shame are negatively associated\nwith delinquency (Spruit et al. 2016). However, existing studies exploring these\nrelationships are correlational in design and do not provide causal evidence\nthat increasing shame can decrease criminal behavior. Indeed, interventions\ntrying to induce guilt (Spruit et al. 2016) or shame (Jones 2014) that seek to\nreduce recidivism have been unsuccessful or have backfired. Furthermore,\nshame promotion has been clinically discouraged because of its potential to\ntrigger aggression (Schalkwijk 2015).

Other problems that are associated with bully victims include\npoor social adjustment (Nansel et al. 2001), social isolation (Juvonen et al.\n2003; Veenstra et al. 2005), alcohol use (Nansel et al. 2004; Stein et al. 2006),\nmental health symptoms (Kaltiala-heino et al. 2000; Juvonen et al. 2003),\nbehavior disorders (Kokkinos and Panayiotou 2004), personality difficulties\n(Kaltiala-heino et al. 2000), and relationship difficulties (Kumpulainen and\nR\u00e4s\u00e4nen 2000). Consistent with the above, other research suggests that a\nsubgroup of shooters experience psychological disorders such as depression,\nsuicidal ideation, and/or various psychiatric disorders and/or were loners who\nfelt isolated and separated from peers (Gerard et al. 2016).\nIoannou et al. (2015) conducted a systematic content analysis of 18 variables\ninvolving the offender characteristics of 40 rampage school-shooting cases,\nundertaken by students or former students from 1966 to 2012 (95% male,\nmean crime age of about 16). Three major themes emerged using the smallest\nspace analysis, suggesting that the school shooter (i) was psychologically\ndisturbed (e.g. on psychiatric medication, had been diagnosed with a psychi-\natric disorder, had been bullied, had suicidal thoughts, was a loner, watched\nviolent media, or wrote about violence), (ii) was rejected (e.g. as evidenced by a\nrecent breakup of a relationship, past suicide attempts, home abuse, or recent\nsuspension from school), and/or (iii) had engaged in a pattern of past criminal\nbehavior.\nExperimentally assessing the circumstances under which emotions (e.g.\nshame, rejection) or social behavior (e.g. bullying, isolation) activate aggres-\nsion for particular people, as well as finding potential ways to mitigate these\nprocesses, would fill important gaps in our knowledge. Interestingly, in a\n19-year longitudinal study, the existence of emotional regulatory problems\nin children 6\u20137 in age \u2013 as assessed by teachers and parents \u2013 was the single\nbest predictor of later adult convictions for violent offenses at age 25\u201327\n(Young et al. 2016). In that study, high emotional regulatory problems were\nsignaled by parental/teacher endorsement of items that included worrying\nabout many things: being unhappy, tearful, or distressed, being fearful of new\nsituations, being fussy, and being unresponsive or apathetic. These findings at\nleast suggest the possibility that interventions targeting improving emotional\nself-regulation and skills development, including communication skills, in\nhandling fears and new situations in a more age-appropriate way might\nmitigate the potential for subsequent teen and adult violence, including that of\nschool shooters.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A review of the literature outside of school\nshooters indicates no common mental health profile for terrorists. However,\nas with school shooters, higher levels of some psychological characteristics\nmay be contributing factors. Such characteristics account for less than half of\nall individuals in any terrorist subsample (Gill and Corner 2017). Subsets of\nindividual factors (e.g. suicidal ideation, alcohol and substance abuse, underly-\ning mental health factors) may be prevalent prior to terrorist involvement or\nexacerbated during involvement (Bubolz and Simi 2015), as is also the case for\nschool shooters.\nRecently, researchers have acknowledged the complexity of terrorist involve-\nment and have advocated moving from profiles to understanding pathways\nthat elucidate how individuals are engaging and disengaging from involvement\nwith terrorist activity (Horgan 2008). Additional individual factors that may\npredict terrorist action may include early experience (e.g. risk taking, reduced\nsocial contact) (Taylor and Horgan 2006), personal victimization (McCauley\nand Moskalenko 2011), and displaced aggression (Moghaddam 2005). Just\nas complex dynamics may lead to behavioral radicalization, deradicalization\nmay involve grappling with a range of affective responses (e.g. burnout, regret,\ndistress, fear, experienced victimization) through means such as psychological,\nsocial, and/or familial counseling (Gill and Corner 2017).\nTaking a broader look at the literature exploring mental health and antiso-\ncial/violent teen and adult outcomes, chief predictors appear to be childhood\ndifficulties with emotional regulation and/or abuse (Juvonen and Graham 2001;\nde Roy van Zuijdewijn and Bakker 2016). Indeed, childhood and adolescent\nemotional regulation capabilities are negatively predictive of subsequent inter-\nnalizing and externalizing issues and may be critical underlying causal factors\nacross a range of mental health and other outcomes (e.g. alcohol and abuse dis-\norders, self-harm, etc.) (Berking and Wupperman 2012; Marusak et al. 2014).\nInteresting, adult individuals with early life history indicators (e.g. early abuse,\nviolent delinquency) in a prospective longitudinal study were at risk for a variety\nof criminal offenses including violence (Lansford et al. 2007).\nResearchers must better understand this pyramid of behavior and its under-\npinnings. What cues/indicators might predict radicalization and deradicaliza-\ntion of behavioral risk? Understanding the role of individual and contextual\nfactors that may dynamically operate to produce emergent radicalization of\nlone actors is an important target of future work (Gill et al. 2014; Gill 2015;\nGill and Corner 2017). Many of the same underlying factors (e.g. problems\nwith emotional self-regulation) that may provide a pathway to terrorism may\nalso provide a pathway to other negative outcomes for individuals and society\n(e.g. violent and other criminal externalizing behavior, mental health disorders,\nself-harm, alcohol and drug abuse).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Thus, for\nexample, many teens and young adults (a) are rejected, (b) have mental health\nproblems, or (c) have a history of criminal problems yet don\u2019t become school\nshooters: if a, b, and/or c, the behavior (d: school shooting) is a low probability\nevent. But given d behavior, the probability that the school shooter exhibited\na, b, and/or c is relatively high. On the other hand, similar interventions (e.g.\ninvolving emotional regulation and communication skills training) might be\neffective for a broad segment of adolescents and young adults with high levels of\nrejection, mental health problems, and criminal historical patterns in reducing\ntheir propensity for negative outcomes, including relatively rare terrorist events\n(e.g. shooting rampages). Later, we return to a consideration of an example\nfrom the terrorist domain, identification of children who may have the emo-\ntional regulation difficulties that might be mitigated to reduce school-scooter\npropensities. Next, we discuss how to use an approach called Socially Opti-\nmized Learning in Virtual Environments (SOLVE) to develop a representative\ngame with virtual choices as in everyday life and also incorporate an interven-\ntion to change behavior of interest for a given target audience.\nThe SOLVE Approach\nOur work with the SOLVE approach involved some of the first successful\nattempts to reduce shame through an intervention and to show that reducing\nshame subsequently reduces risky behavior. In the following, we describe\nhow we used virtual representative design to model real-world situations\nexperienced by our target population (i.e. young at-risk MSM). We also\ndiscuss the results of our research using the representative virtual world and\nimplications of those findings for future research designs.\nOverview of SOLVE\nThe original method of SOLVE was a way to study the potential value of vir-\ntual interventions in changing risky sexual behaviors for MSM to reduce the\nspread of HIV (Miller et al. 2011, 2016; Christensen et al. 2013). SOLVE was\ndesigned to capture the real-world challenges MSM face and the behavioral\noptions they had in sequences and narratives that lead to risky sex. Indeed,\nwhether the SOLVE intervention used interactive video (Read et al. 2006) or,\nmore recently, intelligent agents and a game platform (Miller et al. 2011), the\nintervention was found to reduce risky sexual behavior for men in the game\ncondition (vs. control) and, based on self-reporting, in the real world as well.\nWhen we designed SOLVE for the application of changing MSM\u2019s risky sexual\nbehaviors, we intervened in the decision-making of SOLVE users in numer-\nous ways. For example, we included a virtual future self (VFS).

Within the virtual world of SOLVE, the VFS\nintervened after the user made a risky choice and delivered a message (prior\npilot work suggested) might be effective in changing their decision-making (i.e.\nthey would choose to engage in a safer behavior). Users then could revise their\nbehavior choice before action in the game proceeded. In this way, SOLVE mod-\neled social and communication skills for negotiating safer sex. See Figure 16.1.\nShame Reduction as a Key Intervention\nAs we worked with this population of risky men starting in the late 1980s, it\nbecame apparent that sexual shame was a contributing factor to risk behavior.\nIndeed, we have found among our risky MSM that sexual shame is correlated\nwith past sexual risk (Christensen et al. 2013). To reduce shame in our inter-\nventions, as well as normalize men\u2019s sexual desire for other men, our guide\nmessages used what we called an ICAP (Interrupting risky choices; Challenging\nthose choices; Acknowledging men\u2019s desires, emotions, and motives; and Pro-\nviding a means to achieve those in a less risky fashion).

Of note, across\nfour game studies, the participants\u2019 real-world 90-day sexual behavior was sig-\nnificantly related to virtual sexual choice behavior, highlighting the relevance\nof virtual behavior to real-world behavior.\nIntelligent Agents in Games\nIn designing environments to be representative of the contexts within which\nindividuals make decisions, the other social actors are an important part of\ncontext. Although one can create other social actors as a director would in\nchoosing actors for roles, it is also possible to differentially set parameters\nof intelligent agents (e.g. their beliefs, their goals) to simulate the types of\npotential partners that may differentially result in risky or safer choices for\nour target population. That is what the SOLVE-IT (SOLVE using intelligent\ntechnologies) intervention did, using a software tool called PsychSim (Marsella\net al. 2004), which is a multi-agent-based tool that simulates and predicts\nhuman social behavior. PsychSim is theoretically grounded in theory of mind\nand allows construction of agent simulations that include mental models\nabout others. Considerable formative research found MSM who took sexual\nrisks disproportionately included men whose attachment style was apt to\nbe avoidant/dismissive, fearful, and anxious. Thus, we created a similar set\nof potential virtual partners whose propensities (e.g. goals, beliefs, verbal\nresponses) would be representative for our target population. The result\nwas conversational sequences and interactions that were realistic for these\nmen (Miller et al. 2011). Obviously, one could manipulate the parameters of\nintelligent agents for many experimental conditions examining controlled\nsocial interactions between humans and agents (and agents with one another)\n(Feng et al. 2017; Jeong et al. 2017).\nGeneralizing Approach: Understanding and Changing Behavior\nAcross Domains\nUp to this point we have argued that it is possible to create representa-\ntively designed virtual environments for a target population for behavior of\ninterest. These could serve as a control or default condition against which\nto compare experimental conditions, which are the default plus additional\nsystematic manipulations of variables within that environment. Intelligent\nagents in games offer another rich source of experimental manipulations.\nTogether, a default control and experimental conditions, built onto that default\nenvironment, provide a new way to combine systematic and representative\ndesigns into a new integrative design: systematic representative designs.

In the following sections,\nwe discuss how our experience can inform future research designs in a variety\nof pressing health and security contexts.\nAcross domains of behaviors that have potential risk for health and safety\nin the United States, research has examined contextual, affective, and social\nfactors influencing behavior. For example, affective factors such as shame and\nhumiliation may be especially important mechanisms to understand in health\ncontexts. Other affective responses, such as fear and threat avoidance are key\nin contexts such as emergencies. Emotional regulation skills have positive\neffects for individuals and society across diverse outcomes, and deficits in\nemotional regulation skills are problematic. Social factors, including the\nperceived or actual responses of others, and our beliefs about others, may\nplay key roles in individual decision-making (e.g. deciding whether to trust\nauthorities in creating social challenges that may lead to riskier choices). But,\nexactly how and when these factors (one\u2019s own or the inferred goals, affect,\nand beliefs of others) exert causal influence, and for whom, is unclear. Details\nregarding the causal sequences and choice points that lead up to the behavior\nof interest \u2013 key points for intervention \u2013 are largely unknown.\nExperimental Designs for Real-World Simulations\nOur understanding of decision-making is informed by both theory and\nmethodology. One of the major challenges for modeling social behavior is\nthat our classic systematic experimental designs are primarily focused on\nestablishing internal validity, often at the expense of generalizability (Mook\n1992). However, an alternative \u2013 representative design \u2013 can contribute to both\ntypes of validity. Below we discuss the two types of designs \u2013 systematic and\nrepresentative \u2013 that historically have been used in psychological experiments,\nand we suggest how they could be integrated to afford experimental designs\nfor virtual environments and real-world simulations.\nStandard Systematic Designs and Representative Designs: A Primer\nThe dominant modus operandi in social scientific theory testing is standard\nsystematic design: a design that affords the potential for causal inference (sub-\nject to well-known problems, such as hidden variables). Systematic designs\ninvolve measuring one or more participant outcomes (i.e. the dependentDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nExperimental Designs for Real-World Simulations 369\nvariable(s)) after first varying (e.g. manipulating) one or more preconditions\n(i.e. the independent variable(s)) to which participants are exposed. These\ndesigns afford the opportunity to test the causal effect of a manipulation of an\nindependent variable (e.g. treatment vs. control) or combination of indepen-\ndent variables (e.g. treatment A and B vs. alternative control conditions) on\none or more dependent variables (Shadish et al. 2001). A goal of systematic\ndesign is to ensure the internal validity of the experiment and therefore permit\nat least cautious causal inference. An experiment is said to have internal\nvalidity if variability in the dependent variable across conditions can only be\nattributed to researcher manipulation(s) of prior condition(s).\nKey to classic systematic designs is random assignment of subjects to con-\nditions. Researchers randomly assign participants to experimental conditions\nto reduce a threat to internal validity (i.e. self-selection to condition might\nintroduce an alternative source of variability that might be responsible for\ndifferences across conditions other than the manipulated variable). Yet, the\nimpact of random assignment and self-selection (as in everyday life) on the\ngeneralizability of research results to the real world warrants further attention\nin social science research.\nFirst introduced by (Brunswik 1955), representative design is founded on the\nlogic of inductive inference and sampling theory. These designs sample from the\nsituational features to which one wishes to generalize (Hammond and Stewart\n2001). Situational features include both individual, social, and other factors,\nas well as environmental conditions. If sampling mechanisms pertaining to the\nenvironment are incorporated, then it can be argued that representative designs\nmay have a higher capacity to produce generalizable results and increase exter-\nnal validity for conclusions about causality (Cook and Campbell 1979).\nSystematic Representative Virtual Game Designs\nSystematic designs have historically had an advantage in enabling researchers to\nmake cause\u2013effect claims, assuming an absence of threats to internal validity.\nTypically, however, systematic designs do not generalize to real-world situa-\ntions as representative designs can. We believe that virtual games can afford\nthe benefits of both approaches if the following conditions are met: (i) a con-\ntrol or default condition is designed, (ii) hooks for experimental manipulations\nwithin the default condition that afford alternative experimental groups against\nwhich to compare participants in the control/default condition are created,\nand (iii) participants within a given target audience are randomly assigned to\nrepresentative control and experimental virtual game groups. Once randomly\nassigned to condition (representative control or experimental group(s) that are\ncontrol conditions with experimental manipulations), participants within con-\nditions are self-selecting themselves into various paths, as they do in real life.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This is a naturally occurring representative design\nor a kind of background or control condition, which for the specific target pop-\nulation and behaviors of interest brings the real world into the lab. The control\ngroup provides a correlational laboratory, enabling us to examine differences in\nhow individuals respond, which might produce safer or riskier choices. That is,\nthe default control provides a testbed for understanding correlational patterns\npotentially within persons as well as between persons. Details regarding how\nto create such an environment are provided below.\nWhat Are Hooks and Experimental Alternatives?\nWhen designing a virtual environment that is representative of everyday life,\nthe choices provided, including the sequences within which they are embed-\nded, are designed to be representative of those for a given target audience (e.g.\nMSM) with a given behavior of interest (e.g. risky sex). In the virtual world,\nthe behavioral options at choice points can be expanded, narrative sequences\ncan be changed, and additional interventions can be built in (e.g. after a user\nmakes a choice, he/she is given an intervention message and has a second\nchance to decide how to continue). These hooks for alternatives within the\ngame allow for alternative experimental conditions (e.g. systematically manip-\nulating alternatives of interest to be compared against the control/default\ncondition).\nThis enables us to have a systematic representative design that combines a\nbackground (i.e. a control condition representative of real-life decisions in a\ndomain for a given target audience) that is held constant while manipulating\nvariables of interest across conditions. This manipulation allows for the com-\nparison of experimental condition results against the control condition (i.e. the\nbackground). Indeed, we could think of these control groups or default con-\nditions as model systems that have been demonstrated to have validity (e.g.\nvirtual validity involving significant correlations between target individuals\u2019 vir-\ntual and real-life past behavior). Because these model system control groups are\ngiven in games and experimental conditions are added (or changed) in them,\nreplications are much easier whether for basic or applied research.\nAlthough to date, some game interventions have been developed using\nrepresentative designs, they have not to our knowledge been built combin-\ning representative design and interventions. This is because when many of\nthese game interventions were first developed, cost significantly precluded\ndesigning and developing game default controls. Nonetheless, we believe it\nis possible to pull these functions apart to create a systematic representative\ndesign approach. But questions remain: how does one create representative\nenvironments, what are their challenges, and are they feasible? What evidence\nsuggests their promise? We explore such questions below.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In our work, we used a range\nof tools (e.g. interviews, surveys, focus groups) to identify factors (e.g. obsta-\ncles to safer sex) that could produce the behavior of interest (e.g. risky sex)\nfor our target population (e.g. MSM). Today\u2019s technologies make this process\nmore feasible. In the forthcoming sections, we provide a guide to designing\nvirtual representative environments, drawing from lessons learned in our own\nwork.\nMeasuring Occurrence of the Behavior of Interest (BoI) in Time\nBefore one can create a sampling frame, one has to identify when and under\nwhat circumstances the behavior is occurring. EMA (Stone and Shiffman 1994;\nShiffman et al. 2008) is one useful tool. EMA allows participants to report their\nreal life in the moment of naturalistic experiences. Typically, researchers know\ntheir ultimate behavioral target of interest. They can track these by asking\nparticipants to self-report this information close to the behavioral occurrence\n(e.g. daily; every minute) in diaries or using EMA technologies. Smartphone\ntechnologies and similar devices may eventually enable the automatic trace\nrecording of (or probabilistic inference about) behaviors without (or with\nless) conscious input from target audience members. For example, wearable\nwrist biosensors (for electrodermal activity, skin temperature, acceleration)\non emergency department patients have been used to assess the ability of\nresearchers and clinicians to detect drug (e.g. opioid, cocaine) relapse in\nnaturalistic settings (Carreiro et al. 2015; Carreiro et al. 2017). A recent\nreview (Adams et al. 2017) indicates how biomarkers pertaining to psychiatric\nfunctioning (e.g. stress, anxiety, substance abuse) are being used in conjunc-\ntion with geo-positioning system data and self-reports to assess behavioral\noccurrence (when, where). Another review further highlights how sensorsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

To do so requires creating a sampling frame of\nstimuli/challenges and preconditions that can result in BoI. Before creating a\nsampling frame, researchers must identify and be able to measure the potential\nchallenges and preconditions of interest. Several approaches may facilitate\nthis. One approach is identifying possible challenges based on self-reports.\nFor example, in formative unpublished work, we identified over 100 obstacles\nto safer sex, as well as the frequency of their occurrence, as reported by a large\ntarget population sample. Another approach is to measure thoughts, feelings,\nmotives, events, or behaviors in real time at regular intervals (e.g. daily if the\nbehavior might occur daily) over a long enough period of time (e.g. months)\nto establish possible contextual cues or contingencies prior to a BoI (e.g.\nfeelings of rejection or shame immediately precede risk 90% of the time, and\nthe absence of such feelings results in safe choices 100% of the time). Learning\nmore about the contextual factors that precipitate the risk (e.g. what type of\nrejection or shame from whom) and cues (e.g. what was said, done, sensed)\nthat precipitated this reaction (e.g. precipitated rejection or shame) could be\npart of identifying contextualized challenge points for inclusion in the game.\nCreating a Sampling Frame of Challenges\nOnce a thorough listing of potential challenge points that could lead to risky\nbehavior is generated, researchers may consider other factors to determine how\nto sample these potential challenge points. For example, how frequently is a\nspecific challenge encountered by the target audience? How impactful is this\nchallenge (e.g. when confronted with this challenge, a high percentage of target\nindividuals exhibit risk, but do not do so in the absence of the challenge)? How\nextensive are the research team\u2019s resources (e.g. for animation, game design) in\ndeveloping challenge points within the intervention (i.e. fewer resources may\nsuggest more of a focus on the most frequent and high impactful challenges)?\nOf course, the more one samples from the population of challenges to which\none wishes to generalize, the more likely game experiences and choices will\nmirror real-life choices.\nCoding/Structuring Sequences as in Everyday Life\nChallenges and responses are not random in individuals\u2019 sequences of actions.\nRather, their meaning likely is affected by the events (including one\u2019s own andDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The meaning of events is often\nstructured in causal sequences called scripts. Scripts represent a structured\nevent sequence, or knowledge structure, that organizes expectations regarding\none\u2019s own and others\u2019 behaviors in fulfilling roles. For example, in the context\nof a visit to a restaurant, various roles (e.g. customer, waiter) are fulfilled in dif-\nferent scenes (e.g. enter, order, eat, pay). Entry and exit conditions to the next\nscene (i.e. branches and alternative tracks in the story) may include leaving the\nrestaurant to walk to a movie theater in this context (Schank and Abelson 2008).\nScripts are retrieved or activated when a precondition is met (e.g. one is hungry\nand has money, and there is a restaurant) and there are available props (cues)\nto activate the start of a restaurant script entry scene (e.g. ma\u00eetre d\u2019 asks if you\nwish a table for two). Scripts that have been activated afford inferences that are\nnot stated (e.g. how one might acquire food), and these scripts help activate\nroles that are relevant (e.g. waiter).\nAs we developed our game for reducing risky sexual behaviors, we identi-\nfied different types of places where our target population most frequently met\na prospective partner. For example, one of these was a bar/club. Within a bar or\nclub, we had to identify frequent pick-up script bar scenarios. A common struc-\nture in a bar pick-up scenario (as identified in our formative research) involved\nthe following: looking around to determine potential availability of partners\nof interest, creating means to meet this other, chatting up the other and get-\nting to know the other, escalating intimacy, testing the waters, and sealing the\ndeal. Within a given scene, some situations are possible, while others are not.\nSome situations are possible across scenes but their instantiation will be differ-\nent. For example, one social challenge is grappling with potential conflict (e.g.\ngiving someone a brush-off ). This could occur during any scene, but the spe-\ncific behavioral options involved should differ by phase of the interaction. A\nbrush-off can involve simply ignoring one\u2019s potential partner\u2019s gaze early on in\na pick-up scenario or involve more (e.g. explicitly refusing a partner\u2019s advances).\nIdentifying script structures is needed to understand the entry and exit\nrequirements into different phases of the interaction and how that may\nconstrain the situation, roles, or behavioral options available to participants.\nFormative research must include understanding typical structures so that\nonce challenges are instantiated within a game, participants will find the game\nengaging and realistic. Those of us who build games must build these scenes in\na game just as a director builds the scenes of a movie or theatrical production.\nA difference here is that the interactive experience is not linear. At every point\nwhere the user selects options, scenes must be prepared for multiple ways\nin which the action might proceed. Whichever sequence the user takes, the\nscenes must dovetail naturally to be believable from the user\u2019s perspective.\nHow are the structures underlying social scenarios and sequences deter-\nmined? In creating SOLVE, we first conducted focus groups and asked\nparticipants to rank possible actions (i.e. suggest their frequency).

We also\nexamined which behaviors (e.g. brush-offs) could be enacted in all scenes.\nThen, these results were subjected to other tests with participants (e.g.\ninterviews) to determine their validity.\nNaturally Covarying Factors/Cues in Situations\nInterviews were used by our teams to walk users through their own and\npotential more general scenarios/scripts, asking target audience members as\nwe slowly proceeded to describe what they saw, smelt, felt, or heard as well as\nwhat their thoughts, feelings, and motives might be as we walked through a\ntelling or rough set of visual cue cards for possible scripts. These enabled us\nto create a more fleshed-out scenario that we could present to others (focus\ngroups, interviewees) to get additional feedback (for additional inclusions we\nmissed or suggested frequent deletions or issues). For example, in some SOLVE\nscenes, we chose physical features (e.g. for and within bars, club scenes, bed-\nroom scenes, sounds, actors, etc.) that, based on target audiences, would likely\nco-occur in these settings (e.g. certain alcohol types and brands, colorings,\nother potential cues/triggers). The goal was to optimize the representation\nof stimulus\u2013response sequences as these are naturally embedded in larger\nsequences for both the target (risky) and non-target (non-risky) audiences.\nOptions Available in the Game\nFor every possible challenge point, there had to be behavioral options that\nincluded options that 90% or more of the target audience would choose at such\na choice point. This required formative research at a conceptual level (e.g. give\na compliment now, or ask a question about the potential partner\u2019s background)\nas well as at a detailed instantiation level (the specific compliments that would\nbe offered given the situation). With each option we also needed to know\n(and conduct formative research to assess) how the action would follow from\nthat point. Also, we needed to be mindful of options that would lead to both\nsafer and riskier sequences of choices (again based on additional formative\nresearch).\nDetermining When and How Things Go Differently to Produce Riskier\nor Safer Choices\nWe conducted additional formative research to examine what choices were\npredictive of riskier or safer outcomes in terms of the behavior of interest (i.e.\ncondomless anal sex). For example, we had MSM who varied in how sexually\nrisky they were indicate the extent to which they experienced various obstaclesDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Generally, especially\nwhen the game was not directly trying to change the behavior of interest,\nwe expected positive correlations between individuals\u2019 real-life and virtual\nchoice behaviors. We refer to this correlation as virtual validity. Indeed, across\nfour virtual environments, we have consistently found that participants\u2019 past\nbehavior was significantly related to their virtual choices (e.g. pertaining to\nsexual and drug choices).\nDefault Control and Experimental Condition Alternatives\nAbove, we mostly focused on what we would have to do to create the default\ncontrol condition. But, as mentioned earlier, we could simultaneously build in\nmechanisms to modify the model default system in creating an experimental or\nintervention condition.\nApplications in Three Domains of Interest\nEarlier we described three domains of interest (preventing disease, mitigation\nof man-made and natural disaster effects, and terrorism). The SOLVE inter-\nvention is an implementation of one of these domains (e.g. reducing premature\ndeath by reducing risky sexual behaviors).\nRepresentative design controls or defaults could be developed for a range\nof target behaviors for many other specific target audiences.

For example, shame and\nfeeling less than, feeling diminished in status by others, and feeling humili-\nated by others may be key in internalizing risk behaviors (continuing unhealthy\npractices) or externalizing behavior, as with acting out on others when anger is\na key part of the affective reaction. Our team has successfully reduced shame\nwith virtual games and found that doing so significantly reduces real-world risk\nbehavior for MSM (Christensen et al. 2013; Park et al. 2014). Perhaps simi-\nlar shame or humiliation targeted interventions could enhance self-regulation\nby violence-prone and/or fearful individuals. Generally, however, emotional\nself-regulation and communication skills may be important in reducing risky\nbehaviors that adversely affect individuals and society. The potential even exists\nfor effective interventions to be accessed over the web free to the public (as seen\nin the SOLVE intervention). Given their potential for scaling up, advancing the\nopportunities for such evidence-based interventions and linking them to exper-\niments might rapidly advance cumulative social science and the well-being of\nthe public.\nWith this background, Table 16.1 illustrates succinctly how systematic rep-\nresentative designs could be developed, using examples from the new domains\nof interest we indicated at the outset: preventing disease, mitigating harm in\ncrisis, and reducing school-shooter terrorism.\nConclusions\nA systematic effort to develop the theory- and evidence-informed virtual sys-\ntems we have discussed could transform our basic social science paradigm and,\nin the process, advance replicability and generalizability. We have used our\nSOLVE game in neuroscience studies to provide insight into the cognitive and\naffective dynamics underlying risk taking and in randomized-controlled trials\nto reduce such sexual risk taking. In this work we have suggested ways to extend\nthe method into other domains in which behavioral changes are sought.\nWe believe such model systems could materially change social science.\nFirst, default control conditions uniquely afford a way to examine the virtual\nvalidities or relationship between real-life behavior and virtual lab behavior,\nproviding a statistical way to ensure the generalizability of the laboratory\ngame environment. Sufficiently complex default conditions in games, as in real\nlife, could provide model systems, each for a target population for a specific\nbehavior of interest.\nSecond, because one can use these default controls as a starting place for the\nexperimental conditions of choice, one can hold variables constant except for\nthose being manipulated experimentally: this enables the experimentalist to\nsystematically experimentally manipulate one or more factors against a known\ngeneralizable environment.

If the researcher\ncan also use sensor technologies to detect when users are in similar contexts in\nreal life, there is the additional possibility of just-in-time interventions in real\ntime at just the right moment to change just the right behavior for just the right\ntarget audience. Also, from a computational perspective, data scientists could\nuse that data to know how changes in the system might likely causally change\nbehavior when, for whom, and why.\nThird, this approach bridges basic and applied work because one can rapidly\ngo from a default control to an experimental group and conduct initial basic\ntests of theory and then possible intervention effectiveness. Then, one can\nrapidly scale up an intervention, if promising, to be conducted over the web.\nFourth, this approach allows us to operate across many levels of scale. For\nexample, the basic and experimental conditions and findings from applied\nwork could also generate hypotheses that could be tested at lower levels of\nscale (e.g. via neuroscience studies) in the lab, while users are behaviorally\nresponding in the virtual game in the scanner. Fifth, experimental (e.g. social\npsychological) and correlational approaches (e.g. more common in personality\npsychology) are brought together in that researchers from both traditions can\nexamine the relationships within and between virtual and real-life environ-\nments, assessing in finer detail the nuances of situations and contexts that in\ncombination with individual differences affect and change behavior.\nAll of these possibilities afford a potential revolution in computational social\nscience. First, the design affords the potential for complex environments where\nfew and many environment manipulations can afford causal inference. Second,\nat the same time researchers and data scientists can know the extent to which\nthe behavior in context for a given target population is apt to be generalizable\nto real life. That should provide data scientists with a much better idea of how\nto use such evidence-based research to computationally model behavior while\nalso providing a quantitative index for the level of confidence they should have\nregarding its generalizability.\nReferences\nAdams, Z.W., McClure, E.A., Gray, K.M. et al.

In these instances, they are used as\na type of virtual laboratory to test hypotheses about what will happen (or in\nthe case of historical battles, what might have happened) when a given deci-\nsion is made under a certain set of conditions. Such games can be highly sim-\nplistic or exquisitely detailed; they can be board, card, or Internet games; or\nthey can be highly choreographed simulations, sometimes involving multiple\n(in many cases high-level) personnel from military and government. While\nthe use of games as a didactic and exploratory tool is widespread, they are\nused less frequently to gather data on player actions for subsequent statisti-\ncal meta-analysis. Some reasons for this are the small size (in statistical terms)\nof the participating groups, the differences in the games and simulations them-\nselves from game to game, and the difficulty in acquiring and storing analyzable\ndata in real time.\nOnline games offer the potential to address some of these difficulties. Online\ngames are designed and developed to be hosted and accessed via the Internet,\nallowing a large and diverse player pool to participate under sets of conditions\nthat are both tunable and recordable by researchers. One particular category\nof online games, massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), is especially\nintriguing as they can provide data on a large number of players interacting in\na shared, persistent world over an extended period of time.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Exper-\nimental techniques are a powerful means of identifying causal relationships,\nwhich are critical for designing interventions in a system.\nWe argue that for studying national security issues, where data is sparse, it is\ndifficult to experiment: behaviors can be complex and varied, and online games\ncan serve as a unique and powerful tool to experimentally understand causal\nrelationships.\nWe begin with a discussion of the potential of online games and the specific\napplicability to help address national security issues. We outline a proof of con-\ncept analysis that we performed using data collected from an existing MMOG,\nwhich herein will be referred to as Game X to preserve the anonymity of the\ngame, in order to compare conflict phenomena within the game to data from\nthe real world and a scientific analysis of the real-world data selected from the\nacademic international relations literature.\nWe end with a discussion of considerations to have when using games as\nexperiments. Particular issues arise when developing a game as a vehicle for\nstudying human behavior. The fundamental problem is the need to engage sub-\njects in the game for extended time periods (on the order of hours to years). In\norder to naturally encourage this (as opposed to paying subjects), games must\nbe designed in particular ways. These design choices have ramifications on the\nsubject behavior and analysis of data from a game. We outline some research\nconsiderations on this topic.\nOnline Games and Massively Multiplayer Online Games\nfor Research\nOnline games can span a wide range of characteristics (Laamarti et al. 2014;\nDe Lope and Medina-Medina 2017). There are many types of online games,\nranging from simple single player games such as Fruit Ninja, to more social\ngames such as Words with Friends or Farmville, to tactical heavy action games\nsuch as Call of Duty, to highly complex and social role-playing games such as\nWorld of Warcraft and Eve Online. The latter games are often referred to as\nmassively multiplayer role playing games (MMORPGs); however, we will use\nthe term MMOG to refer to all games (whether role playing or not) in which\nplayers interact for extended periods of time in a shared, persistent world.\nMMOGs are online games that attract players from around the world of\nall ages, genders, and educational backgrounds to a shared virtual world\n(Yee 2006). The diversity and size of the player base, which for some games\n1 See also Guarino et al.

Data on millions of actions performed by a\nlarge and diverse sample of people lends itself well to statistical analysis, better\nthan surveys and laboratory experiments with much smaller sample sizes\ntaken from a more homogeneous group (e.g. college students, who frequently\nparticipate in academic human research studies (Gosling et al. 2010; Henrich\net al. 2010). They also offer the opportunity to see how different types of\nplayers respond under different circumstances, to interrogate differences\namong players, and also, in war gaming, to uncover novel strategies that would\nnot have occurred to personnel typically involved in these games.\nThere are many types of MMOGs, ranging from simple browser-based games\nsuch as Farmville to highly complex and realistic role-playing games such as\nWorld of Warcraft and Eve Online. The latter may be of particular interest as\nan experimental platform, especially in the social sciences, because of their\nrealism, complexity, and degree of player involvement. The use of games as\nexperimental platforms for scientific and other researches will, of course, be\ncriticized as providing data that is only meaningful within the game context\nand that cannot be used to draw conclusions about the real world (Williams\n2010). The legitimacy of game data for research purposes is a real concern, and\none must be considered both in the experimental design phase and in analyz-\ning and appropriately caveating the results of MMOG experiments. However,\nresearch has shown that player behavior in complex and realistic role-playing\ngames may be representative of behavior in the real world because of the invest-\nment in time, effort, and reputation made by participants in their player avatar\n(Castronova 2008; Lu et al. 2014). In addition, this type of MMOG is often\nbased in a virtual world composed of highly complex economies and social\nstructures, some of which evolve organically and not as a result of a rule set\ngoverning the game platform. Because of the complexity and realism of this\ntype of game, in-game behaviors may mimic real-world economic and social\nbehaviors.\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that many existing methods of data gathering\nhave their own associated problems. In social science research, for example,\nsurveys and questionnaires are used that may collect incomplete and/or biased\ninformation; questions may be misunderstood by respondents or may be for-\nmulated in such a way as to bias the respondents\u2019 answers. As with all scien-\ntific data, the analysis of and conclusions drawn from MMOG data must be\nunderstood appropriately, and the inherent limits of such games acknowledged.\nFindings from a statistical analysis of game data, for example, are easily val-\nidated using results from future game play; however, this only demonstrates\nthat the findings are valid within the game context. Conclusions drawn from\nplayer actions in an MMOG will be much more difficult to validate in the real\nworld (Williams 2010). Game data can still be used for statistical analysis and\ncompared with results in the real world; the work that we will describe below isDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

As in the real world, statistical results from game data must\nalso be understood not to provide \u201cthe answer\u201d to a given research question,\nbut rather a range of likely answers, a distribution, a mean, and outlying data\npoints which in and of themselves may be interesting to researchers.\nWhere Is the Benefit?\nOnline games can provide exceptional value to research efforts that meet any\nof the following three criteria: data is sparse and difficult to obtain, it is difficult\nor impossible to build a real-world experimental laboratory with built-in con-\ntrols to perform the research, and the research is interested in not only finding\naverages and distributions of player behavior but also exploring a wide range\nof possible behaviors and examining results that don\u2019t fall neatly within a given\ndistribution (i.e. \u201cdistillation games\u201d; Perla et al. 2005). Of course, these types\nof unexpected results are always the most interesting to science; online games\nprovide a method of capturing and quantifying conditions that creates these\nresults in a way typically unavailable in some realms of scientific inquiry.\nAreas where these conditions apply and online games might be leveraged\ninclude the social and behavioral sciences, war studies and planning, and inter-\nnational relations research. The last, international relations, meets the criteria\nbecause of the sparsity of data usable for quantitative analysis. As will be dis-\ncussed in detail below, academics often use the military and interstate disputes\n(MIDs) data collected by the Correlates of War project to mathematically eval-\nuate the effects of various military, economic, and other parameters on the\nlikelihood of conflict between sovereign states. The MIDs data span instances\nof conflict occurring over less than a century; they do not capture all variables\nof potential importance to the analysis of conflict; and, crucially, it is not pos-\nsible to gather significantly more data over the few years funded by a typical\nacademic research grant. As such, this last area is one in which MMOGs can\npotentially contribute tremendous value as experimental platforms that can\ngenerate large amounts of data in condensed timeframes from games engi-\nneered to answer specific research questions. Our work described below shows\na first attempt to take data from an MMOG, operationalize it so that it is cap-\ntured in a way approximately equivalent to the MIDs data and the economic\nvariables from an international relations journal article that we chose as a com-\nparison study, and perform the same statistical analysis on the game data as was\nused in the journal article in order to compare the results.\nWar Games and Data Gathering for Nuclear\nDeterrence Policy\nWar studies and planning meet all of the criteria used to evaluate online games\nas research tools that were enumerated in the Introduction: data from warsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Games and simulations have been used for more than a century to\nstudy important historical battles and to envisage future ones. Because they\nare referred to as games, they are often disparaged as serious tools of schol-\narship, although there have been cases where the game contains more his-\ntorically accurate detail about a given battle than narrative works on the sub-\nject (Sabin 2014). However, war gaming and simulations are taken quite seri-\nously by military planners and policy-makers. During the Cold War period,\nNobel Prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling, working at the RAND Cor-\nporation, was instrumental in designing and executing war games for military\nplanning purposes. Schelling believed that war gaming was essential in filling\na gap in war planning: analysts don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know, and they\nwon\u2019t think of every possible future battle or crisis contingency. War games\nallow scenarios to unfold without a human mastermind planning and predict-\ning every step, which means that they can sometimes enter new and unusual\nterritory. Reid Pauly summarized this point nicely in what is perhaps the only\nmeta-analysis of United States politico-military war games published to date,\nin recounting events surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. As Pauly\ntells it: \u201cDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis, a participant in the office of John\nMcNaughton remarked, \u2018This crisis sure demonstrates how realistic Schelling\u2019s\n[war]games are.\u2019 Another responded, \u2018No, Schelling\u2019s games demonstrate how\nunrealistic this Cuban crisis is.\u201d\u2019 In the same meta-analysis, Pauly examines his-\ntorical war games in order to probe the attitudes of strategic elites \u2013 that is, mili-\ntary and policy professionals with experience and education relevant to combat\nand nuclear weapons \u2013 toward willingness to use a nuclear weapon in combat.\nThis work followed a publication by Scott Sagan and Benjamin Valentino cit-\ning the surprising willingness of the American public at large to use a nuclear\nweapon against an adversary state, in violation of a hypothesized nuclear taboo\n(Press et al. 2013).\nOne enormous potential benefit of using an MMOG to answer a similar ques-\ntion about the willingness or unwillingness of particular groups of people to\ndeploy a nuclear weapon (or other weapon of war) in combat is the large, diverse\ngroup of people that participate in this type of online game. If some basic data\nare gathered on the player participants (such as occupation and level of educa-\ntional attainment), then data from game play can be post-processed to evaluate\nthe decisions of various groups and compare them against each other. In fact,\nit would be fascinating to compare such an analysis of MMOG data to Sagan\nand Valentino\u2019s finding that the public is not overwhelmingly averse to using\nnuclear weapons in combat and Pauly\u2019s finding that strategic elites are averseDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Would we find the same difference in attitudes in player behavior\nin the game setting?\nAttitudes toward nuclear use may be a factor in effective \u2013 or ineffective \u2013\nnuclear deterrence. The United States and its allies rely in part on deterrence, in\na communicated willingness to retaliate in kind, to protect them from nuclear\naggression by nuclear armed adversaries. As Schelling remarked in his land-\nmark 1966 book Arms and Influence: \u201cThe power to hurt is bargaining power.\nTo exploit it is diplomacy \u2013 vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.\u201d In order for\ndeterrence to work, that is, in order for it to influence an adversary to avoid the\nproscribed action, the threat of nuclear retaliation must be deemed to be cred-\nible. The Cold War era logic of the threat of mutual annihilation as the foun-\ndation of deterrence is summarized neatly by the acronym MAD, or mutual\nassured destruction, a phrase coined in Cold War strategist Herman Kahn\u2019s\nHudson Institute (Deudney 1983). The deterrent power of MAD, in part, drove\nthe United States and the Soviet Union to invest hugely in their respective\nnuclear arsenals in order to maintain nuclear parity with each other and pre-\nserve global strategic stability.\nToday\u2019s political and technological environments are markedly different than\nthose of the Cold War. The Soviet Union collapsed and splintered in the 1990s,\nleaving only a nuclear-armed Russia. China, India, and Pakistan have acquired\nnuclear arsenals. In addition to the change in the nuclear landscape, however,\nthe world has also seen changes in political and economic relationships and the\nrise of new technologies that may affect strategic stability in new ways. Whereas\nfear of nuclear destruction may have driven strategic military planning during\nthe Cold War, for example, fear of economic devastation may serve as a strong\ndeterrent in today\u2019s economically interconnected environment.\nGiven the (fortunate) paucity of data on nuclear use in conflict, war games\nare a valuable means of generating and analyzing scenarios involving nuclear\nexchange. Nuclear standoffs have been evaluated using war games for decades;\nthe additional value that the online game brings to the study of these scenar-\nios is the ability to record massive amounts of data from hundreds of play-\ners, for later analysis over multiple instances of game play. A chat feature will\nallow researchers to gather data on player\u2019s thoughts and motives surround-\ning in-game decisions. In addition, the game allows capture data not only on\nnuclear use but also on the conditions of the game environment at the time\nof use. These metadata can later be evaluated to determine if there are other\nheretofore unexamined factors that significantly influence nuclear use (or the\nlikelihood of simple conventional conflict, for that matter).\nIn the section that follows, we will discuss how MMOG data can inform\nefforts in the academic areas of international relations and policy studies to\nunderstand the influence of multiple different factors on the likelihood of con-\nflict between states. These factors include military, economic, and political ele-\nments, and their effect on conflict is analyzed using the MIDs variables firstDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The data collected using an MMOG may be\ncombined with the real-world MIDs data to better study the effects of these\nvariables. The MMOG allows the collection of significant amounts of additional\ndata in years to come, much more (hopefully) than the data that will be gener-\nated by real-world wars. In addition, the game can be designed to gather data\non variables that may be relevant to conflict but which are not currently in the\nMIDs canon. The utility of the MMOG to further academic debate on the sub-\nject of economic interdependence and conflict will be examined in detail in the\nfollowing section.\nMMOG Data to Test International Relations Theory\nThe relationship between economic interdependencies among states and like-\nlihood of conflict between them has been explored using data in the academic\nfields of political science and international relations, with divergent results. For\ndecades, academics have performed regression analysis on conflict data from\nthe Correlates of War project to establish linkages between trade volumes and\nconflict likelihood. The results of these analyses range from evidence that trade\nincreases instances of conflict between states (the view of the realist school of\ninternational relations theory) to findings that trade decreases conflict likeli-\nhood (the view of the liberal school) to work testing the assumption that the\nimpact of trade relations on conflict is more complex than the realist/liberal\ndichotomy would suggest. To date, this dispute in the academic literature has\nnot been resolved.\nThe research question of whether economic interdependence positively or\nnegatively affects conflict is one that lends itself to study using an MMOG\nsince additional data is desirable for the type of statistical regression analysis\ntypically performed in the literature but is hard to come by in the real world.\nData from game play of an online game such as the one described above may\nbe useful in further elucidating the nature of the relationship between eco-\nnomic interdependencies and their effect on the willingness of nations to go\nto war with each other. As a proof of concept, however, we took data from an\nextant online serious game with a steady user base, data which members of\nour project team had collected and used earlier in unrelated research. Game\nX contains the elements necessary for comparison to real-world research on\neconomic interdependence and conflict: there are guilds within the game (com-\nparable with nation-states in the real world) that trade and wage war with each\nother, and there are other quantifiable factors within the game that correlate\nwith those captured by the MIDs variables. These parameters include conti-\nguity (whether states are located next to each other geographically; a strong\npredictor of conflict in the real world), alliance, and capability ratio. The capa-\nbility ratio variable in the MIDs data set is a relative measure of the CompositeDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The\nCINC score is based on the population, urban population, iron and steel pro-\nduction, energy consumption, military personnel, and military expenditure of a\nstate. In Game X, we used combat strength ratio, economic strength ratio, and\nsize ratio, all quantities tracked within the game as a measure of player score,\nas proxies for capability ratio. The MIDs variables and comparable Game X\nvariables are shown below in Table 17.1.\nFrequently in the international relations literature, linear regression analy-\nsis is performed on one or more economic variables to discern a correlation\nbetween them and instances of conflict within a dyadic pair. The variables listed\nin Table 17.1 are used as controls. We performed a similar analysis on 739 days\nof Game X data operationalized to populate the economic, conflict, and control\nvariables for direct comparison of our analysis to the academic literature. We\nbegan by taking a sample journal article (Barbieri 1996) that regresses the MIDs\ndata against three different economic variables defined by the author: salience,\nsymmetry, and interdependence. The variables are defined mathematically as\nfollows:\nTrade Sharei = Dyadic Tradeij\nTotal Tradei\n(17.1)\nSalience = Sqrt(TradeSharei \u2217 TradeSharej) (17.2)\nSymmetry = 1 \u2212 |TradeSharei \u2212 TradeSharej (17.3)\nInterdependence = Salience \u2217 Symmetry (17.4)\nThe purpose of our work was not to validate or invalidate the variable defini-\ntions or the conclusions of the article, but simply to directly compare statistical\nanalysis of serious game data to similar analysis of real-world data reported in\nthe literature and to compare results of the analysis and examine how and why\nthey might be different.\nTo operationalize the economic and conflict data in Game X, we started by\nmeasuring combat and trade between guilds over the entire 739-day period.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

As such, we divided the time period in 25 consecutive\n30-day month periods and calculated the trade and combat measures on a\nmonth-to-month basis. Dyads were the main unit of measurement, as defined\nby a pair of guilds that engaged in trade, combat, or both at any point within\na month period. The resulting unit of dyad month is similar to the dyad year\nunit used in the Correlates of War database to store the MIDs data. There were\na total of 297 guilds and 13 079 unique dyad pairs over the entire time period.\nWe excluded dyads that included the game itself (i.e. game-controlled entities\nor non-player characters) and guilds engaging in trade or conflict within itself.\nThis resulted in 47 748 observations. On average, only 18% of dyads measured\nengaged in conflict over the 25 periods of data gathered.\nMeasurements of trade between members of a dyad were modeled after\n(Barbieri 1996). First, the trade share for each member of the dyad was cal-\nculated by taking the amount of trade with the dyad partner (imports and\nexports) divided by the total amount of trade conducted by that dyad member\nwith all trading partners (including trade with other guilds, trade with players\nnot belonging to guilds, and trade with the game). See Eq. (17.1). Trade Share\nis bounded by 0 and 1; its value approaches 1 as trade from Guildi becomes a\nlarger fraction of overall trade conducted by Guildj. From here, three economic\nvariables were calculated: salience, symmetry, and interdependence, defined\nby Eqs. (17.2)\u2013(17.4). Salience was formulated by the journal article author\n(Barbieri) in order to capture the importance of the trade relationship to the\ndyadic partners; a high salience score should indicate that the relationship\nis important to at least one of the partners in the dyad. In fact, a highly\nasymmetric trade relationship might obfuscate the importance to one trading\npartner (a very small fraction of one multiplied by a larger fraction of one), but\nour intention here was not to contest the measurement methods employed by\nthe article but simply to replicate them. The variable salience turned out to be\nvery small on average in the Game X data set (mean = 0.006, range = [0, 0.09],\nmedian = 0.0001). The dyadic trade share was often a very small fraction of\noverall trade for a given guild.\nThe variable symmetry is defined in Eq. (17.3). Using this definition, values\nclose to 1 should indicate a relatively symmetrical trade relationship, while very\nsmall values should indicate an asymmetric relationship. In the Game X data\nset, most trade share values were very small, as noted above. Because of this,\nmost symmetry values were close to 1 (mean = 0.998, range = [0.3, 1]). Inter-\ndependence, defined as in Eq. (17.4), reflects the problems inherent in both the\nsalience and symmetry values, and because it multiplies the symmetry values,\nwhich approach but are still fractions of 1, by the small salience (approach-\ning 0) numbers, it results in each case in very small interdependence scores\n(mean = 0.0006, range = [0, 0.074]).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This method\nof encoding does not capture whether the conflict was part of a larger effort\ncoordinated by the guild or simply a one-off battle between two individuals. As\nsuch, the variable of conflict in Game X may not correlate well with the conflict\nvariables from the MIDs data set, which capture state-level disputes and wars\n(Table 17.2).\nTable 17.2 Game X conflict data summary.\nCount of dyads engaging in conflict and/or trade in each month period\nConflict present Conflict absent\nMonth ID Trade present Trade absent Trade present\n1 3 2 11\n2 73 66 398\n3 120 97 786\n4 145 142 1016\n5 123 124 1271\n6 104 160 1421\n7 149 118 1566\n8 130 162 1589\n9 124 133 1731\n10 153 230 1817\n11 133 172 1772\n12 153 186 1951\n13 159 195 1981\n14 147 193 1977\n15 209 705 2000\n16 155 398 1944\n17 127 203 1971\n18 177 155 2013\n19 147 138 2061\n20 218 433 2137\n21 183 494 1971\n22 182 255 2213\n23 199 189 2249\n24 195 129 2083\n25 108 77 1558Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Random intercepts\nwere included for each dyad, such that the overall estimated intercept was\nadjusted slightly for the error variance due to each dyad\u2019s likelihood to engage\nin combat. This allowed us to look at the effect of the economic predictor\nvariables, also known as the fixed effects, while accounting for variability in\nthe baseline likelihood of conflict between individual dyads. The dependent\nvariable predicted by the logistic regression model was likelihood of conflict\nbetween two dyads (bounded by 0 and 1) during the time period analyzed.\nLogistic (also known as logit) regression was used because of the categorical\nnature of conflict (either it occurred or it didn\u2019t, there is no combat continuum),\nresulting in a binary dependent variable that can take either a value of 0 or 1.\nThe fit to the data from the logit model generates an equation that estimates a\nprobability, or likelihood, of the dependent variable occurring (having a value\nof 1) with a given value of the independent variable. The equation includes\nan intercept and a coefficient applied to the independent variable, which are\nshown in the results tables that follow. The equation takes the form:\np(x) = 1\n1 + e\u2212(\ud835\udefd0 +\ud835\udefd1 x) (17.5)\nwhere x is the dependent variable and p is the function of x that estimates the\nprobability. The regression coefficients \ud835\udefd, shown in the odds ratio column in\neach table, indicate the strength of each economic indicator in predicting the\ndependent variable. These coefficients are a calculation of the odds ratio:\n\ud835\udefd =\n( p(conflict)\n1 \u2212 p(conflict)\n)\n(17.6)\nThree different analyses were performed: the first on all guilds over the\nfull-time period, the second only on dyads that include one big guild (defined\nfor purposes of this analysis as guilds with more than 30 members), also over\nthe full-time period, and the third on data gathered only during the periods\nof stability between a period of two large wars, which took place in months\n17\u201319. These three different analyses were performed in part to examine\nwhether big guilds behave differently than small guilds and whether economic\npredictors behave differently during peacetime and wartime.\nAnalysis 1: All Guilds, Full-Time Period\nThe data set for this analysis included all dyads across the entire time period.\nThe three economic indicator variables are not actually independent of eachDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Fortunately, Barbieri does\nseparate regressions against each variable in addition to her full model, which\nincludes all three variables together. We replicated her methodology, using\nfour different models, which we will designate M1, M2, M3, and M4. M1\nregresses against only against salience as the economic predictor variable,\nM2 only against symmetry, M3 against interdependence, and M4 against all\nthe economic predictor variables together (equivalent to the full model). The\nmodel results can be seen in Table 17.3 for all guilds.\nThese results appear to indicate that the symmetry variable is correlated\nstrongly and positively with likelihood of conflict. It is possible that only\nsymmetry registers as statistically significant because it is the only indicator\nthat is not a vanishingly small number, as are salience and interdependence.\nSimply for purposes of comparison directly to the academic literature, the\nresults of the M4 analysis are shown side by side with the full model results\nfrom [1] in Table 17.4. As mentioned above, the variables salience, symmetry,\nand interdependence are not independent of each other, and the M4 results\nare given here simply for purposes of comparison. Barbieri\u2019s work shows a\nnegative correlation between both those variables and likelihood of combat,\nwhile our analysis shows a positive correlation. On the other hand, Barbieri\nshows a positive correlation between interdependence and conflict, (ours\nis negative), where interdependence is simply a product of the two other\neconomic variables. It is likely that the nonindependence of the economic\nvariables is confounding the statistical analysis and is complicating comparison\nof our results.\nAnalysis 2: Large Guilds, Full-Time Period\nThe data set for the second analysis included only large guilds (guilds with 30\nor more members) across the entire time period. The results of all four models\nrun on this data set are shown in Table 17.5.\nModels M1\u2013M3 show no significant effect of the economic indicators on\nconflict likelihood. There is, however, a positive correlation between strength\nand size ratios and combat likelihood (combat is more likely if there is a power\nasymmetry).\nLarge Guilds, Interwar Period\nThe data set for analysis 3 included only dyads with at least one large guild\nand was restricted to the three months between large wars. The results of this\nanalysis can be found in Table 17.6. Here we see the same correlation between\npower asymmetries and conflict likelihoods that we saw in analysis 2 and the\nsame lack of significance in the economic variables.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

One\nimportant note is that the definition of the economic factors was defined in\nsuch a way that many dyads had extreme values (either at the very low or very\nhigh end of the scale) and were all derived in some way from trade share (so\nthey were nonindependent predictors), both of which could have skewed the\nresults. No interactions were included between any of the control variables and\nthe economic predictors, so we cannot say whether, for example, symmetry is a\nmore important predictor for contiguous versus noncontiguous guilds. Future\nwork could address these questions in more detail.\nOperationalizing MMOG Data\nThere were several issues as we operationalized the real-world variables into\nGame X.\nIn Game X the closest analogue to countries was guilds, which were player\ncreated and managed. However guilds have no physical boundaries and can\nvary greatly in size. Countries and states in the real world have strict bound-\naries. This made the operationalization of the contiguity control variable diffi-\ncult as it relied on geographic distance between countries.\nThe lack of publicly documented agreements had a significant effect on oper-\nationalizing the alliance control variable. Since we primarily used the Is Foe\nvariable, we were aggregating positive relationships that span multiple types,\nfrom merely neutral to strongly positive. In the real world treaties and other\nagreements provide a formal method to assessing the strength of alliances.\nMany guilds in Game X have exhibit organizational properties, including\nroles and a hierarchy (Lakkaraju and Whetzel 2013). However, there is no public\nprocess to codify this organization. In contrast, in the real world, constitutions\nand laws are drawn up and publicized.

We could not\noperationalize that in our current analyses.\nEven if a guild establishes laws and codified them into a public document,\nit is not clear if we can define what a democracy is, and whether real world\ndefinitions can apply.\nMMOGs, at their core, are games that are meant for entertainment. An\nimportant part of entertainment is the ability to explore and make mistakes\nin an environment with little consequence. Clearly such behavior can be\nexhibited by players, especially early on in the game. We must account for this\nin our analysis. We suspect that as players stay in the game longer, they are\nmore attached to their character and will act in a way to protect their character.\nWe must be aware of this and sample the data to try to avoid the exploration\nphase of the player\u2019s behavior.\nIt is impossible to draw any real conclusions about the effects of economic\nties and combat likelihood in the game, given the way that the economic vari-\nables are defined. However, the purpose and focus of this work was not to do\nso but to demonstrate a proof of concept: that data from an online serious\ngame (Table 17.5) can be operationalized in the form of economic, political,\nand military variables and that statistical analysis can be performed on that data\nfor direct comparison with academic studies of real-world data (Table 17.6).\nThrough this exercise, we have identified some of the key issues with using game\ndata for national security research, which we describe in more detail below.\nWith a carefully designed game such as the proposed MMOG described above,\nwe believe that we can populate a database with conflict data to use in future\nacademic research. The work on Game X described here is an example of how\nMMOGs can be used as experimental platforms and contribute to research\nefforts in policy areas where data are otherwise sparse.\nGames as Experiments: The Future of Research\nAs discussed and demonstrated in the sections above, games as experiments\nhave both a long history and a bright future. While games have historically\nbeen used to probe possibilities in a simulated space and recreate in detail his-\ntory as it happened, the future of research with games may include gathering\nlarge amounts of data for analysis of multiple kinds, not only the traditional\nanalysis of interesting trajectories that the game play took due to unexpected\nplayer actions but also statistical and other quantitative analysis on the poten-\ntially massive amounts of data that can be gathered using a game with a large\nplayer base such as a MMOG.

Analysis such as the logistic analysis performed above can help inform\nresearchers and policy-makers of the potential impact of particular trade, mili-\ntary, or diplomatic relationships on future outcomes, such as the likelihood for\nconflict that we tested in our analysis of Game X, which correlated positively\nwith power asymmetries in our analysis.\nAs we consider the utility of online games for research, we must still be aware\nof the difference in intention: games are meant, fundamentally, to engage a\nplayer through entertainment. To maintain engagement, the design of games\nmay cause issues when used for experimentation. We posit the following con-\nsiderations when analyzing game data.\nSimplification\nEntities and processes in the game world are simpler than in the real world. This\nis for multiple reasons. First, it is to reduce the cognitive burden of learning\nthe game. Second, it is to provide an environment that is focused on the core\npurpose of the game. The simplification makes the mapping between real-world\nentities (our actual target of interest) to game world entities difficult, as we saw\nin the mapping of guild to nation states above.\nOption Abundance\nGame choices (while certainly simplified from the real world) are often pro-\nvided in plenty. To maximize engagement, players need to be able to explore\nand discover new things. However, in experimental contexts one often wants\nto limit the number of options for a subject in order to study the underlying\nrelationship better.\nEvent Shaping\nThe game may push the player to make certain choices or experience certain\nevents. For instance, games often encourage conflict through resource manip-\nulation. When considering the correlation between in-game behavior and\nreal-world behavior, one must be careful to account for the potential forces\nthat are driving in-game behavior.\nAnother factor is that players may be focused on exploring the world initially,\nand the game may encourage that by providing simple initial environments.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

What both MMOGs and\nreal-world laboratories offer is the possibility to test hypotheses in a controlled\nsetting and to manipulate the controls in order to observe how differences\nin controls affect experimental results. The potential for MMOGs to serve as\nexperimental platforms for various types of research is enormous given the\nlarge sample size that they provide for analysis and the ability to engineer the\nonline environments to address specific research questions.\nThe exercise we detailed in this chapter, to operationalize variables from\nan existing MMOG, served a useful purpose in highlighting potential issues\nthat can arise when studying game data, especially for national security issues.\nUnderstanding, and addressing, how simplification, option abundance, and\nevent shaping can influence data analysis and interpretation of results is an\nimportant future work.\nAcknowledgments\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and\noperated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the US Depart-\nment of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract\nDE-NA0003525.

Also, this comes at the cost of small or unrepresentative samples,\npriming effects, and situation-specific constraints that can limit the gener-\nalizability of research findings. Field studies are an alternative for observing\npopulations in their natural social environments, but managing interactions\ncan be difficult (although natural experiments are occasionally possible).\nThe advent of online communities and mobile technologies has created new\nopportunities for social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) research. Commercial\ngames, in particular, provide a rich opportunity for SBE researchers to perform\na different type of field study, observing populations in the natural social\nenvironment that is provided by the game. This is often a more controlled\nenvironment than real-world habitats \u2013 defined by the rules and characteristics\nof the game \u2013 but still provides an opportunity for observing human behavior\noutside of a laboratory environment (albeit with many of the behavioral\nimplications of online anonymity and game behavior). Communities evolve\nwithin games (e.g. players interacting in massively multiplayer online games\n(MMOGs)) and in the emergent communities surrounding them (e.g. forums\nfocused on game discussion or popular streaming communities). Using games\nand surrounding game communities, researchers can observe behaviors\nreflective of other online SBE interactions, as well as limited aspects of\nface-to-face interactions. For example, games and surrounding communities\noften include their own forms of law enforcement (i.e. trusted community\nmembers responsible for enforcing rules and addressing misbehaviors) and\nprovide a platform for a host of intricate social functions, from powerful\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Many games have independent player-driven economies (Taylor\net al. 2015; Drachen et al. 2016), some of which maintain larger economies\nthan some real-world countries (Nazir and Lui 2016). Game communities\ncan have a significant impact on player behavior within the games because\nplayers evolve their approach based on community discussions and, in many\ncases, real-world economic implications (e.g. streamers earning a comfortable\nliving through donations from their followers [Gandolfi 2016; Johnson and\nWoodcock 2017]).\nA strength of research on human behavior in games and game communities is\nthe sheer size of the available populations. Large-scale game populations pro-\nvide more opportunities to observe behavioral phenomena and ultimately to\nincrease the statistical power that can be realized in field or experimental stud-\nies. Game populations that number in the millions provide an opportunity to\nrun studies with populations on par or larger than real-world field studies (e.g.\nobserving people in natural interactions), but within a more controlled context\nwhere game rules guide interactions, and, in some cases, can be manipulated to\nstudy specific phenomena. For example, Riot Games\u2019 League of Legends (LoL)\nhas over 67 million players that use the game each month and over 7.5 mil-\nlion simultaneous players using the game regularly at peak hours. Riot Games\ncollects a vast amount of data, including player behaviors and decisions, player\ncommunications in public and private communities, and player characteristics.\nMuch of this is made available through a public application programming inter-\nface (API). In collaboration with academic institutions, Riot has run a variety of\nstudies to understand what motivates players, what behaviors are observed in\neffective teams, and how problematic behaviors (e.g. bullying) can most effec-\ntively be discouraged (Blackburn and Kwak 2014; Conway and deWinter 2015;\nKwak et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2016).\nSurrounding communities also provide vast populations for study.\nTwitch.tv \u2013 a key social media framework that enables live video streaming of\ngameplay to large audiences \u2013 is the fourth most trafficked site in the United\nStates, with over 100 million monthly users (15 million daily active users) and\nmore than 2.2 million unique content creators each month. Twitch reaches a\nlive, engaged, and concentrated Millennial population that has been constantly\ngrowing since its inception (Gargioni 2018). Nearly half of users spend more\nthan 20 hours each week viewing content, and streaming has become a\nlucrative business for popular content creators. At a minimum, further explo-\nration of large-scale games and surrounding game communities can provide\nan unparalleled opportunity for field studies, observing human behavior in\npartially constrained environments with large populations. To the extent that\nresearchers can collaborate with game companies and associated game com-\nmunities, these online settings can provide an even more powerful capability\nto manage experimental research with these large-scale populations (e.g.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We first describe the\ntypes of social interactions, behaviors, and economic interactions that can\nbe observed in these game environments. We then describe the various data\nsources that are available in the gaming community and the challenges for\naccessing and interpreting this data for SBE research objectives. We review\nthree case studies in which we collected and analyzed user behavior in games\nand community environments, performing limited-scope SBE research to\ndemonstrate the value of these data sources. Finally, we provide conclusions\nsummarizing the potential of gaming as a platform for SBE research and recom-\nmendations for improving these communities to better support future studies.\nCharacterizing Social Behavior in Gaming\nWhile researchers are still learning how best to interpret behavior in games\nand game communities, these settings clearly enable extensive observation of\nmany SBE phenomena. Table 18.1 provides examples comparing the context of\nexperiments and behaviors in live environments with those of games and game\ncommunities. Many modern online games require significant human inter-\naction and often involve player teams ranging from two-player partnerships\nto large-scale coordinated raids with dozens of players. Players cooperate to\novercome game-provided content and to implement potential game strategies.\nIn some games, players compete with others, either as a primary objective\nof the game (e.g. in player-vs.-player (PVP) strategy games) or as a potential\nadditional challenge while overcoming other game objectives. Collecting data\naround these in-game behaviors can provide research insights into teaming\nand leadership behaviors, incentive mechanisms, friendships, and differences\nbetween positive and negative player behaviors. Furthermore, SBE researchers\ncan study how the rules and characteristics of the game affect behaviors across\ngames and teams.\nMany games have rich and complex social and economic features as well.\nIn MMOGs, for example, players socialize as a regular part of their gameplay.\nThis socialization can include political interactions where different players\ncompete for control of social groups (e.g. to control teams and guilds). It leads\nto social structures that drive how players interact (e.g. through leadership and\nsupport roles). Within games, players discuss their personal lives, bully other\nplayers based on disagreements, and form lasting relationships (e.g. in-game\nmarriage).

Game economics sometimes carry over to the\noutside world, with players purchasing in-game resources using real-world\nmoney and some players even using this mechanism to earn a real-world\nsalary through gameplay (Knowles et al. 2015; Patel 2016). Using these games,\neconomic researchers can potentially investigate and manipulate limited game\neconomies with constrained interactions in real-world economies.\nGame communities also provide opportunities for studying human behavior,\nsocial interaction, and economic decision-making.

Both contexts exhibit political,\nsocial, economic, and behavioral interactions. Highly skilled players or popular\npersonalities gain significant respect and rise to positions of power and profit\nthat make them trusted contributors. Community members form friendships,\nwhich may extend outside of the original social media setting. In some ways,\nthe surrounding game communities can provide more context for studying\nSBE phenomena than in-game behaviors, as players are not as distracted by\nthe actual gameplay. A deeper understanding of game community data can\nenable SBE research to investigate a wide range of interactive behaviors across\na variety of online behavioral phenomena.\nGame-Based Data Sources\nIn this section, we review gaming data sources that can be used to study SBE\nphenomena. We categorize these into four classes. The first two focus on data\nsources for in-game behavior, treating the game as an online environment for\nSBE research. Direct in-game data is often collected by the game developer and\naccessed by APIs when they are made available (e.g. LoL at developer.riotgames\n.com; Guild Wars 2 (GW2) at wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main; Eve Online\nat community.eveonline.com/support/api-key). In some cases, another option\nfor accessing this kind of data is third-party software that extracts similar data\nas the game executes (e.g. TorchCraft for StarCraft 2 data). Meta-game data,\nwhich includes a host of meta-information that external users collect about\nthe game, describes successful and unsuccessful game strategies, skills, and\nbehaviors. This data can be found in a host of community and third-party sites\ndescribing the game, where avid players work to gather data about how the\ngame is played (e.g. what strategies and approaches are used).\nThe next two classes focus on data from the community of players surround-\ning games. Here, the focus is not on studying game behavior, but is rather on\nstudying how the player community behaves and interacts outside of the game.\nAsynchronous community data includes forums, podcasts, and videos, along\nwith the commenting and discussions that surround this content. Players are\nnot interacting in real time, but rather are interacting asynchronously as they\nobserve and react to new content. Synchronous community data includes a\nvariety of streaming content sources (e.g. Twitch.tv, YouTube Live) and the\nreal-time interactions involving those sources.\nIn-Game Data Sources\nMany online games record a significant portion of the events and actions\nwithin each game session, primarily for developers to use in improving theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nGame-Based Data Sources 413\ngame experience. Some games, such as LoL, GW2, and Eve Online (Eve),\nmake this data available to the public or to registered third-party developers\nfor use in developing websites or other products designed to improve the\nbroader game experience. Some developers (e.g. Riot Games, developers\nof LoL) may agree to expose this data to researchers if the research is\nrelevant to their interests. Typically, the data available consist of the most\nimportant actions within a game, including combat or other active deci-\nsions, strategic choices, and player-to-player transactions. For example, in\nLoL, the data API provides a match detail object that can be collected for\nknown matches. Each match detail object contains data on the summoners\n(player profiles) involved in the match (which team they were on, which\nchampion [character type] they selected, aggregated statistics for the match,\nand whether their team won). The objects also contain key match events,\nincluding when and where champions, buildings, or major neutral minions\nwere killed; the items purchased by each champion; and each champion\u2019s\nposition every 60 seconds. This level of detailed data allows researchers to\nexamine how game players behave and interact within the constraints of\nthe game rules and strategic objectives. In our first case study (see section\n\u201cCase Study 1: Extracting Player Behavior from League of Legends Data\u201d),\nwe used LoL data to analyze links between specific in-game behaviors and\nperformance.\nEven when game companies make data available, that data is often con-\nstrained. Few game companies make their data easily available to researchers,\nlimiting the pool of possible sources. APIs that do exist can often be burdened\nwith licensing fees or usage restrictions. These licenses are crafted to protect\nnot only the personal data of the players but \u2013 most importantly perhaps \u2013 the\ncompany\u2019s intellectual property and commercial aims. Companies are sensitive\nto perceptions of improper data use, and gamer communities are uncom-\nfortable with clandestine activities that might affect the integrity of the game\n(such as asking study participants to act according to out-of-game objectives).\nThis makes it difficult or impossible to design studies that manipulate play in\nsome way and then measure the effects of these manipulations. While there\nhave been some examples of game companies working with researchers to\ninvestigate game manipulations (most notably, work by Riot Games to investi-\ngate bullying in LoL (Blackburn and Kwak 2014; Conway and deWinter 2015;\nKwak et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2016)), in most cases it is difficult or impossible to\nmanipulate game characteristics.\nFor this reason, most studies using game data can best be compared to\nfield studies, where game players are observed in the game environment\nand comparisons can be made across players performing in different game\ninstances and modes. Researchers must work within the constraints of\nplanned game updates and game features provided by the game company.\nFor example, the most common forms of competitive play in LoL requiresDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n414 Using Sociocultural Data from Online Gaming and Game Communities\nrandom matchmaking, which would restrict researchers from ensuring study\nparticipants are teaming together or playing under a targeted condition or\nconstraint. While small-scale studies can bring participants into a lab and use\nassigned matches, these studies do not take advantage of the vast populations\nthat could otherwise be exploited in these games. In GW2 or Eve, typical\nbehaviors involve many players in an open, persistent world, creating situa-\ntions where manipulations will affect and be impacted by nonparticipants who\nhappen to be present at or tied to the events that are manipulated. Avoiding\nthis collateral participant issue requires clever design of manipulations that\naffect only a single team, isolate participants from nonparticipants, or obtain\nconsent from unplanned participants.\nWhile game data is made available in some instances, chat data that is\ncommon to many online games (e.g. for in-game communications and\ncoordination) is rarely, if ever, made available to researchers through game\nAPIs. Many game companies collect this data when it is done in-game, but\nthe perception of potential privacy infringement prevents them from sharing\nthat data with researchers or third-party developers. While the data can be\nmanually collected by researchers or their proxies, such collection is limited.\nFor example, researchers performing field studies in which they observe chat\ndata within the game will be unable to view any private channels or messages.\nResearchers can require study participants to share their chat data, but this\ncan limit studies to small populations of self-selected participants, potentially\ncreating biased results and removing the ability to exploit large-scale game\npopulations. Another approach may be to collect chat data using companion\napps (e.g. apps that players can run to automatically record chat while playing\nthe game). However, while these apps may be easier to use, they ultimately\nhave the same constraints on study populations as requests for participants to\nshare their chat data.\nThere are also challenges interpreting in-game data, stemming from several\nconfounding factors. In-game strategies are complex and give significant con-\ntextual meaning to different behaviors. Aggression and risk-taking behaviors,\nfor example, manifest in very different ways in LoL, GW2, and Eve. A metric\ntuned to identify aggressive play in LoL might look at how often a player\nattacks other players over non-player character (NPC) adversaries. In Eve, this\nmetric would be less meaningful, since most situations are either purely PVP\nor player-vs.-environment (PVE). In GW2, there is some blend of the two,\nbut the metric would be harder to interpret because of the need to determine\nthe context. Tuning metrics of this sort requires deep knowledge not only of\nthe meaning of the variables recorded by the game but also of the strategic\nand meta-game context of those variables, as well as the way people actually\nplay or expect each other to play. In games with deeper social aspects, social\nnorms (such as expectations of leaders or group members) can also affect the\nmeaning of these variables.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nGame-Based Data Sources 415\nAnother challenge is that the data provided by game companies is shared at\na level of resolution decided by the company. Having no obligation to share\nany data with research communities, companies will often constrain how they\nshare the data, both because they may not wish to share detailed behaviors with\npotential competitors and because they are trying to minimize data sharing\ncosts. For example, in LoL, position data within the game is provided at very low\nprecision (every minute). These limitations can create significant uncertainty\nin interpreting the actual motion of players\u2019 characters in the game and lead to\nmissing entire events that occur between data points.\nDespite these constraints, when in-game data is provided \u2013 particularly for\ngames with very large populations, such as LoL \u2013 it provides an extensive source\nfor studying online behavior and social interaction. Researchers have been able\nto directly observe in-game interactions across tens or hundreds of thousands,\nor even millions of players, and can extract how these interactions impact a\nvariety of cooperative and competitive social behaviors. The data can provide\ninsights into how strategic decisions and activities are linked to performance,\nhow these factors impact current and future teaming decisions, and how team-\ning impacts retention and participation. Where relevant, data can provide eco-\nnomic insights as well, enabling researchers to study how much players are\nwilling to pay for certain goods within the game, and, in some cases (e.g. Eve\nOnline), tracking goods exchange in a detailed manner within a thriving eco-\nnomic system (Papagiannidis et al. 2008; Shukla and Drennan 2018; Patel 2016).\nWhile in-game data sources limit researchers\u2019 ability to make experimental\nmanipulations, they allow for extensive field study that can help to make sig-\nnificant advances in the SBE research and modeling community.\nMeta-Game Data Sources\nGameplay and in-game actions are not the only useful source of data describ-\ning in-game behaviors. There are many data sources that revolve around the\nmeta-game of popular games \u2013 that is, the strategies, information, goals,\ncompetitions, and other factors that the game\u2019s fans track, discuss, and\nconsider between game sessions (King et al. 2010; Harviainen and Hamari\n2015; Sk\u00f6ld et al. 2015). Thought and discussion around these topics make\nup a significant portion of the time that many players spend on the game.\nThis is especially true for highly competitive players but can even be observed\nwith casual fans who want to know what the professional players are doing\nor want to maximize the effectiveness of their limited time to play the game.\nMeta-game information is collected, disseminated, and interpreted across\nnumerous fan sites, blogs, YouTube videos, and other websites, creating a\nsocial ecosystem that surrounds many games. For example, for Blizzard\u2019s\nHearthstone \u2013 a card-based online strategy game in which players construct\ndecks to compete against one another \u2013 this ecosystem includes (i) the officialDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These data sources are typically freely available\nto all visitors or sometimes restricted to visitors who create an account or\npay a small subscription fee. These sources provide essential information to\nunderstand the game, which is critical for interpreting in-game data. But they\nalso provide a useful data source on their own for assessing game behavior. For\nexample, sites like Hearthstone Meta Stats (see Figure 18.1) collect data on\nthe popularity of specific strategies, how they are built and applied, and their\nsuccess rates. This data can be used to track trends in the game community, as\nwell as reactions to game updates, new strategies, and public tournaments. It\ncan identify when game approaches become too popular (indicating that they\nmay be overpowered) or lose popularity (indicating they may be too weak). It\ncan provide insights into the popularity of new game features and capabilities,\nhelping to identify which features should be stressed in research studies.\nWhile some of these sites may provide an API for accessing data, most\nprovide data that is unstructured or unprepared for automated consumption;\nthese must be scraped and searched to extract useful information. Analysts\nFigure 18.1 Information on popularity and performance of common decks (strategies).\nHearthstone Meta Stats (http://metastats.net) provides detailed information on popularity\nand performance of common decks (strategies) in the game, providing a powerful source\nfor investigating strategic trends in the player community.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For each data source, the challenge lies in first finding ways to\nextract and aggregate the data (e.g. through crawling the Web, subscribing to\nRSS feeds, or using existing APIs) and then developing metrics for interpreting\nbehaviors and activities within the data. The data is not inherently designed\nto study SBE phenomena; rather, researchers need to identify the patterns\nor terms that represent events in the context of a particular game and then\nmust extract those from the data source. For example, in studying information\nspread in Hearthstone (see Case Study #2, section \u201cCase Study 2: Extracting\nPopularity Patterns from Hearthstone Community Data\u201d), we made significant\nprogress by identifying key terms reflective of Hearthstone strategies using the\nMetaStats data (e.g. cards and deck names). We explored each of the possible\nHearthstone meta-game data sources and prioritized those that provided the\nmost useful and simple to extract data. We were then able to use statistical\nmethods to measure the popularity of particular game strategies based on the\nfrequency of their appearance on these sites.\nData from these sources can require automated interpretation or hand coding\nof video content, audio content, images of graphs, or strategy pages and articles.\nThere are three main forms of meta-game data that must be interpreted:\n(i) Aggregated, static breakdowns that detail strategies or popular patterns of\ngame behaviors that change slowly \u2013 This data is typically updated regu-\nlarly but may grow stale if it is not updated frequently enough.\n(ii) Strategy articles, reviews of game changes, or descriptions of major\nevents \u2013 This data mostly applies to a specific moment in time but\nrepresents a well-expressed and organized expert view of that moment.\n(iii) Forum threads, discussions, and posts \u2013 This data is also situated in time\nbut is typically less organized, is more colloquial, and frequently contains\noblique references to current events.\nUseful content from the latter groups will often have lasting appeal and be\nreferred to repeatedly in later discussions. For example, in Magic: The Gath-\nering ( M:tG), Flores (1999) produced a strategy article Who\u2019s the Beatdown?;\nthis article captures a central aspect of deck-based strategy games and is often\nreferred to by not only M:tG players but also Hearthstone and other card\ngame players. Another challenge in using these sources is that some of them\nmay be flawed, incomplete, or even incorrect, requiring some attention to\ndata validation or verification. Even when these articles are incorrect, it can\nbe interesting to study how the community goes about discovering (or not\ndiscovering) those errors. Finally, many meta-game sources rely on accepted\ncontext and jargon from the game, often without direct reference to its origin\nor definition. This context is dynamic, growing as new game features areDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This can make interpretation of these data sources\ndifficult to automate; it is not only an unstructured data problem but also a\nchallenging process of data discovery and verification.\nNevertheless, meta-game data can be particularly useful for studying\nSBE trends in a game community, ranging from tracking key decisions and\nevolutions of game strategies to observing economic histories of the game (e.g.\nmonthly economic reports for Eve Online). The data can often be accessed\nfor free, with website developers providing an aggregated outcome that\nresearchers can download and interpret. Many of these sites are driven by\ngame players and are well supported by the game developers who see the sites\nas a good means to maintain player interest and participation. Meta-game\nsites still suffer from the same limitations regarding experimental control\nbut provide a powerful field research tool for understanding how game\ncommunities are behaving within the game. In the context of many games,\nthey can be considered parallel to census reports or popular opinion polls for\ngame participants.\nAsynchronous Community Data Sources\nMoving beyond in-game data, many games are surrounded by a thriving\ncommunity that itself can be an interesting subject of SBE research. The\ncategory of asynchronous community data includes any of a wide variety of\nsites that players and fans of a game use to socially interact outside of the game,\nwith one another, with popular personalities or skilled players within the game,\nand with game developers. Community behaviors \u2013 or behaviors of individuals\nwithin the community \u2013 can provide opportunities to trace how information\nspreads, understand how information is repeated, altered, and embellished in\nthat spread, and understand how different community members contribute to\ninformation attaining high popularity. Asynchronous community data sources\nare generally found in three forms: (i) forums that contain posts about in-game\nactivities, meta-game shifts, game news, and other broad discussions between\ncommunity members (e.g. Reddit threads, official forums, major fan site\nforums); (ii) video-based feeds that contain both in-game actions and often a\nbroader discussion around those in-game actions with attached comments,\nchat rooms, and viewers (e.g. YouTube videos, Twitch videos on demand\n[VODs], and other recordings of play by skilled players and personalities);\nand (iii) podcasts focused on the game, which contain information about\nthe game\u2019s community and events. Across all of these forms, the culture of\na game community can be studied, providing an SBE research opportunity\nthan is often more social than the games themselves.

They canDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

They can track how events are managed by the game\ncommunity and by the game developers \u2013 including both player-driven events\nsuch as raids or in-game weddings and developer-driven events such as major\ngame releases. They can understand how groups are formed and leaders\nchosen. They can understand how information spreads or cascades within a\ncommunity and how it changes based on user interactions. Furthermore, in\nstudying all of these topics, researchers have the potential to participate \u2013 that\nis, to post information in a community forum or create their own forum\nwith different characteristics or rules to produce manipulations for potential\nexperiments.\nData collected from forums, videos, and podcasts is typically subject to\nlicense agreements with the website that owns the content, including copyright\nconcerns for the content producers. In most cases (for major sites, like Reddit,\nYouTube, or Twitch), these agreements protect the personally identifiable\ninformation of the users. For public personalities, it can be difficult to strip\nthe identity of the content creator, as the creator\u2019s name itself may be a form\nof shorthand for a particular style of play or commentary (for example, key\nHearthstone personalities can be recognized by their playstyle). Despite\nthese constraints, text data from these sites will often be freely available and\nquite comprehensive, though researchers may need to develop software to\nscrape it from the website. The data can be voluminous, with many language\nartifacts that can be difficult to effectively parse and interpret (e.g. abbreviated\nterms or references, newly invented terminology, careless typos and spelling\nerrors). Content from videos and podcasts poses its own challenges, such as\nspeech-to-text translation in a domain with jargon and many nonstandard\nproper nouns. Many videos have consistently positioned elements, such as\nthe camera feed of the content creator or parts of the game\u2019s display (e.g. a\nminimap or heads-up display), which can be used to extract information from\nthe video given a sufficient computer vision algorithm (e.g. posture, facial\nexpressions, in-game locations, basic game stats).\nGame community interactions pose unique challenges for interpretation.\nFrom a linguistic perspective, the jargon used in these communities evolves\nas the game is updated and changed. Further, it contains community-specific\nvalence words, such as references to past events or game elements that have\nbeen viewed positively or negatively, and thus convey that sentiment; and this\nvalence can evolve as well, as new events occur and change the associated\nsentiment. Games often contain a host of proper nouns that are specific to the\ncontent of the game, including names of players, characters, or personalities;\ngame elements or equipment; competitions or raids; game levels or maps;\nand many others. Even with a strong understanding of the game\u2019s jargon and\ncontent, understanding events or information spread requires a multi-source,\nmulti-format data-extraction procedure.

Media produced on one day might receive\ncomments across weeks or months, and those comments could refer to one\nof dozens of things occurring in the media. Articles might be updated and\nredistributed, without clear indications of what has been changed. Forum\nthreads might be revived after long periods of inactivity, and new posts\nmay refer to early statements from much earlier in the thread. Nevertheless,\nmany of these technical challenges can be addressed to analyze behavioral\ninteractions in these communities, without the need to overcome the harsher\ndata restrictions common to in-game data sources. For example, in Case Study\n#2 (section \u201cCase Study 2: Extracting Popularity Patterns from Hearthstone\nCommunity Data\u201d), after identifying terms of interest reflecting common\ncards and decks used in Hearthstone, we were able to use Reddit discussions\nto explore information and topic spread surrounding these topics.\nSynchronous Community Data Sources (Streaming Sources)\nSynchronous community data sources \u2013 most notably, streaming sources \u2013 are\nsimilar to asynchronous data sources in that they represent an opportunity\nto study social behavior in the community surrounding the game, rather than\nbehavior within the game itself. The major difference found in streaming data\nsources is that they represent a real-time interaction between community\nmembers. Whether it be video streaming or real-time chat across games,\nthese sources provide a view into how game players and observers interact\nand manipulate each other in real time. Perhaps most notable among these is\nTwitch.tv, a highly popular streaming video platform in which game players,\nor streamers, play a game for an audience of subscribers and viewers. The\naudience observes the stream live, discussing and donating in chat rooms\nbased on what the streamer is doing. This live interaction \u2013 which is found on\na variety of similar streaming services in other countries \u2013 is uniquely different\nfrom other game-based data sources, as it provides an opportunity for content\nproducers (streamers) to customize their behavior based on the demands of\nthe crowd (viewers).\nWorking directly with streaming websites or data aggregators for those\nwebsites, significant data is readily available. As with many other data sources,\nthere are licensing terms that must be followed when accessing this data;\nhowever, the data that can be made available includes not only aggregate\nstatistics but detailed chat logs as well. While there remains a strong level of\nsensitivity around how the community will perceive research, companies such\nas Twitch.tv and Muxy have a strong interest in participating in SBE research\nto demonstrate the impact of their data.\nExisting aggregation tools make two kinds of data available. First, a variety of\ntools provide statistical data about the streams, assessing the behaviors of the\nviewership during streaming events (e.g. How does the population change overDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nGame-Based Data Sources 421\ntime? What is the donation or subscription behavior of the population? How\noften does the population shift to new channels?). Second, several tools provide\naccess to chat data from the viewers and subscribers (e.g. the actual text that\nthey provide).\nWhile the statistical data is relatively simple to extract and interpret, other\ndata poses significant challenges for interpretation and use in SBE research.\nChat data poses many of the same interpretation complexities found in\nforums \u2013 the text is often characterized by excessive use of ever-evolving\njargon, valence terms, misspellings, and other difficult text (Olejniczak 2015).\nBecause users are often typing quickly, this problem is even more excessive\nin chat rooms, where shorthand is used as much as possible. Furthermore,\ncommunities use an extensive library of emoji that can have unique inter-\npretations in game contexts. Twitch, in particular, introduces a myriad of\nnew game-specific emoji (Barbieri et al. 2017), including kappa to refer to\nsarcastic reactions to game behaviors (e.g. a sarcastic reference to a good\nmove), PogChamp to refer to nice plays within a given game instance, and\nSMOrc to refer to particularly aggressive game styles. The use of these terms\ncarries significant in-game context as well, for example, bringing a knowledge\nof what it means to make a nice play or be aggressive in specific games such as\nHearthstone or LoL.\nA key challenge in using this data is that the data contained in the actual\nstream is not effectively interpreted for use with other data sources. Currently,\ninterpreting this data would require either a time-consuming and intricate pro-\ncess of manual coding or some combination of advanced video or imagery anal-\nysis (Pan et al. 2016), as well as speech-to-text interpretation and text analysis\nto pull out the events and activities within the stream. Furthermore, it would\nrequire a significant effort to align events extracted from the stream with the\ntimeline captured in the chat data and meta-statistics surrounding the stream.\nCurrently, this kind of analysis has not been done for Twitch; building an auto-\nmated system to perform this analysis would greatly enhance the usefulness of\nTwitch as a data source.\nMore so than the asynchronous game community data, the streaming com-\nmunity provides an opportunity to study a unique online cultural environment.\nThe real-time interactive nature of streaming communities provides a different\ndynamic than any other social media platform, with unique opportunities to\nstudy emergent entertainment behaviors. Researchers can learn how streamers\nbuild and maintain the interest and donations of their fans and how these\nbehaviors differ across subcommunities within Twitch and other streaming\nenvironments. They can understand how the economic framework of Twitch\nworks and what kinds of behaviors lead streamers to be able to be successful\nwithin this framework. They can understand how information spreads or\ncascades within a community, particularly if they can investigate how it might\nbe spread by a streamer or how its spread might interact with other communityDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Case Study #3 (section \u201cCase Study 3: Investigating Linguistic\nIndicators of Subcultures in Twitch\u201d) illustrates an analysis of Twitch chat data\nto understand community subcultures and metadata attributes of the behavior\nof those subcultures.\nCase Studies of SBE Research in Game Environments\nIn this section, we present several case studies of our research investigating\nthe use of game-based resources to study online behavioral phenomena. We\nfirst look at a behavioral analysis of in-game activities extracted through the\npublic data API provided for Riot Games\u2019 LoL. We next look at the use of online\nforums (specifically, Reddit) and online meta-stat sites to explore social and\nbehavioral phenomena in the context of Blizzard\u2019s Hearthstone. Finally, we look\nat a linguistically based subculture analysis of viewer chat behavior in Twitch.tv.\nCase Study 1: Extracting Player Behavior from League of Legends Data\nOur first case study illustrates the use of in-game data provided through\na game API. Game companies that manage online games regularly record\na host of behavioral data capturing the activities of the player community\nwithin the game. While most companies primarily use this data internally\nto assess and revise game balance and discover exploits, some companies\nmake parts of this data available to the research community for study. Riot\nGames, in particular, provides a public API (as well as example data sets)\nfor LoL, the most popular online battle arena video game. This API provides\naccess to a host of aggregate and behavioral data from the game, including\nstatic information about game elements (e.g. items, maps, game types, etc.),\nmatch and tournament information (e.g. a record and timeline of the games\nplayed and maps used, performance statistics by individuals and teams),\nand detailed match data (e.g. selected classes, development and progression\ndecisions, and even movement records showing where players are on the game\nmap at each time step). While there is no data for direct social interactions\n(e.g. chat or audio data) provided by the API, it nevertheless provides access\nto a host of data that enables assessment of players\u2019 SBE interactions. In our\nanalysis, we focused on extracting player behaviors from raw match data,\nassessing how behavioral patterns such as aggression and consistency were\nlinked to success or failure in the game.\nWhile this match data is extensive, it is provided in a raw format that does\nnot inherently provide insight into the specific activities of players. High-level\nstatistics can be readily extracted and assessed (e.g. performance, teamingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nCase Studies of SBE Research in Game Environments 423\npatterns, etc.), but specific interpreted game behaviors are not provided.\nRather, pre-analysis must be done based on an understanding of game tactics\nand activities to extract behavioral patterns of interest. For example, in LOL,\nthere is a distinct role to be played in managing combat lanes in the game\n(these are paths by which an adversary can choose to attack a team\u2019s base). A\nkey aspect of player behavior is the degree to which they effectively perform\na lane management role within a given team and game. However, there is\nno game data to inform analysts of the role each player is performing, nor is\nthere existing game data to inform the analyst of what behaviors are standard,\ndefensive, or aggressive within those roles (e.g. how often they should be\nin the given lane, how combative they should be, how they should shift to\nsupport teammates). Rather, to effectively analyze player behavior, one must\nbring a deep understanding of the game to develop extraction techniques and\nassessments that analyze the player\u2019s location throughout the game. This can\nprovide early insight into the role the player appears to be pursuing and how\nconsistent or inconsistent the player is in pursuing that role. Once roles are\ncharacterized in behavioral patterns, other characteristics can be assessed\nin the context of these roles (e.g. is the player achieving appropriate kills\nin the game, is the player in the lane a sufficient period of time, does the\nplayer maintain the defense of the lane effectively). Analysts can then begin to\nunderstand what constitutes desirable and undesirable behaviors in the game.\nTable 18.2 provides several examples of specific observable strategies that\nwe extracted from LoL match data. Based on these strategies, we attempted\nto build more detailed metrics for assessing laning behaviors (e.g. assessing\nwhether players who maintained their role were more likely to win a game)\nand aggression (e.g. assessing whether aggression toward other players and\ntoward controlling territory led to a higher probability of win). Ultimately,\nwhile we observed different behaviors across different character types and\nroles, we saw no evidence for an impact of laning behaviors on performance,\nwhile our metrics of aggression seemed to indicate that higher aggression\nled to better performance. It was unclear, however, whether these were real\nfindings or simply an artifact of limited definitions of these behaviors. Player\nand territory aggression, in particular, were likely biased in late game stages as\nwinning teams took control of the game; it may be that these metrics would\nhave worked better had they been restricted to earlier stages of the game.\nImportantly, this behavioral analysis of game-specific activities is a challenge\nin any use of in-game data. The game data is unlikely to be organized around\nthe behavioral patterns that emerge from gameplay. Rather, SBE researchers\nwishing to study these behaviors will need to bring a deep understanding of the\ngame to bear and will need to develop computational methods for extracting\nthese behavioral patterns from the raw data that is collected from the game.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In LoL, there are opportunities to explore a wide variety of\nphenomena. Social phenomena can be found in detailed analyses of teaming\nand coordination. Behavioral phenomena can be found in detailed analyses of\nother game behaviors, ranging from individual protests to bullying to activi-\nties centered on following custom and crowd directives. Economic phenomena\ncan be found in detailed analysis of the purchasing patterns for upgrades to the\nchampions players are controlling (e.g. how they choose particular upgrades,\nwhat costs make those upgrades worth pursuing). Some of these factors can be\ndirectly investigated within the data provided by the LoL API, though it often\ntakes significant interpretation and translation to properly define these factors\nin the context of the game. As more games expose this data, SBE research com-\nmunities can benefit by researching phenomena across a wider range of game\ncontexts.\nCase Study 2: Extracting Popularity Patterns from Hearthstone\nCommunity Data\nOur second case study focused on the use of data from the community and\nmeta-game websites surrounding a game. Many modern games are surrounded\nby an active meta-game and online social community discussing the game to\nbuild or better understand game strategies and features. These websites provide\na powerful opportunity to study constrained interactions across large popula-\ntions of individuals with similar interests. Sources that can be used for this type\nof analysis are broad and often publicly accessible, meaning that the data can\nbe readily downloaded or scraped for use and that users have little expectation\nfor the privacy of that data (since it is already available publicly online). Source\ntypes include:\n\u2022 Community forums discussing particular games or related topics.\n\u2022 Major fan sites that focus on game or content reviews and ratings; many\nof these sites aggregate statistics either directly from the game or from\nthird-party observations of the games.\n\u2022 Strategy sites that focus on providing guides for players to improve their\ngame.\n\u2022 Official websites that provide game news, release information, and other\ngame data.\n\u2022 Podcasts that provide commentary on rising trends in the game.\n\u2022 Streaming sites that provide video content of successful gameplay, often with\ncommentary and related discussion.\nIn our second case study, we acquired and analyzed online data available from\ncommunities surrounding Blizzard\u2019s Hearthstone. As previously mentioned,\nHearthstone is a card-based strategy game where online players build and\ncompete with strategic decks combining these cards. We explored a varietyDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nCase Studies of SBE Research in Game Environments 427\nof meta-game and asynchronous community data sources associated with\nHearthstone, seeking those that gave indicators of player behaviors in card and\ndeck selection.\nA key challenge in using these data sources lay in addressing the problem\nof extracting and aggregating the data, which is rarely conveniently stored for\nresearch use. SBE researchers will need to use a variety of software tools to\nacquire such data. They can access it using some combination of subscriptions,\nWeb crawlers, and manual downloads, transferring it into a database for manip-\nulation and analysis. To translate it into a format that can be analyzed, they may\nneed to extract further information from it. For example, extracting commen-\ntary from videos in Twitch or YouTube may require a time-consuming coding\nprocess that can be challenging to keep consistent (particularly across coders).\nIn most cases, these channels incorporate some form of unstructured text or\nlanguage and therefore require some level of text parsing capability for interpre-\ntation. Depending on the sophistication of the desired analysis, this could range\nfrom a simple extraction of key terms and phrases (in our analysis, we focused\non deck and card names from Hearthstone) to an interpretation of the valence\nor content of posts or articles. If more detailed interpretation is desired, this can\npose a difficult problem as the language is often characterized by difficult text\ninterpretation challenges (e.g. game community slang, shortened references to\nkey concepts, pronoun use, typing errors).\nIn our Hearthstone case study, we focused on three data sources:\n\u2022 MetaStats class and archetype usage data: We collected user data for class\nuse and archetype representation in competitive Hearthstone matches from\n1 April to 26 June 2017. The user data shows what classes and deck styles\nthe community had used immediately following an expansion, providing a\nstarting point for determining trends in community behavior. This allowed\nus to create forecasts about future expansions or generalizations to other\ncommunities.\n\u2022 Reddit Hearthstone community data: We extracted all discussions for the\nHearthstone and competitive Hearthstone communities and computed met-\nrics assessing the characteristics of those discussions. Each file includes post\ntime, score (i.e. popularity), user ID, replies, and discussion bodies. We main-\ntain a hierarchy of the Reddit posts and discussions that followed. We use\nthis data to try to identify gatekeepers (Meraz and Papacharissi 2013) and\ndiscussion trends before they occur within the MetaStats data. High scor-\ning posts with many replies are likely to have been seen by many viewers,\npotentially influencing MetaStats. We also explored valence data for all posts\non both Reddit communities, enabling an analysis of community reception\nsurrounding particular messaging.\n\u2022 HearthPwn community data: Similar to Reddit, we collected all forum dis-\ncussions from the General Discussion, Card Discussion, and Deck BuildingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This\ncommunity provides a more focused look at shifts in the game strategy, with\ndiscussions on why cards or deck styles work or fail in the current state of\nthe game. HearthPwn also provides deck building tools within which users\nshare, discuss, and rate decks based on their experiences. We scraped this\ndata to assess how decks evolved.\nUsing this data, we set forth to assess information spread within the Hearth-\nstone community. We began by using the MetaStat data to identify a set of key\nterms for referring to deck archetypes. We then used these as discussion topics\nin the Hearthstone community, assessing the frequency of their mention over\ntime and across community websites and forums. Using this data, we analyzed\nthe relationships between potential gatekeepers in the Hearthstone commu-\nnity, focusing primarily on high-profile game players who are known for their\nskill at the game and their ability to construct and define new decks and strate-\ngies. We found that several deck types \u2013 specifically, the Midrange Shaman\nand Pirate Warrior \u2013 saw an increase in popularity as they were pursued by\nmultiple popular figures, most notably including the Hearthstone personality,\nLifecoach. While we were able to identify some possible gatekeepers after the\nfact, we were unable to identify data-driven indicators of gatekeepers before a\ndeck became popular (beyond the knowledge that known game personalities\nwere more likely to make a deck popular than unknown players).\nNext we explored potential instances of information spread, in which a topic\u2019s\nuse expands rapidly through a community, and information cascades, in which\nthe sentiment around a topic significantly shifts without a clear cause (Cha et al.\n2008; Cheng et al. 2014). We began this analysis by plotting the popularity of\nkey deck types across each of the Hearthstone archetypes using MetaStats data.\nWe identified a number of sudden rises in popularity of particular decks, pro-\nviding a starting point for exploring potential events. Figure 18.2 shows several\nexamples observed in the period surrounding the quarterly Hearthstone update\non 4 April 2017. Specifically, we observe (a) the rise of the Aggro Token Druid\nand the fall and subsequent rise of the Ramp Druid; (b) the belated rise of the\nBurn Mage and the initial rise, drop, and then significant rise of the Secret\nMage; (c) the mid-tier rise of the Control Paladin, belated rise of the Aggro Pal-\nadin, and significant rise of the Midrange Paladin; and (d) the significant rise of\nthe Quest Rogue and the drop and spike of the Miracle Rogue.\nThese examples illustrate common behavioral patterns observed when reg-\nular updates occur in games. Players realize that their current strategies are\nno longer effective (or have become less effective) and rapidly stop using those\nstrategies. Players quickly begin to try new strategies (new decks in the case\nof Hearthstone), in some cases simply to explore the new content and in other\ncases because that content is more effective than previous content.

These kinds of patterns can be observed across numerous games beyond\nHearthstone and represent essential insights for game designers to drive future\ndecisions in game updates to maintain the interest of the player communities.\nBased on the instances of popularity increases that we saw \u2013 and theorizing\nthat these increases arise from initial information cascades on each particular\ndeck \u2013 we next assessed discussions surrounding several key decks on Reddit.\nWe chose not to focus on the decks that were predicted to be successful before\nthe game patch. For example, based on prerelease rumors and advertising mate-\nrial, the Control Paladin, Aggro Paladin, and Midrange Paladin were each pre-\ndicted to be powerful, providing a clear explanation for their rise in popularity.\nInstead, we focused on decks that surprisingly rose in popularity, with the idea\nthat we might be able to observe an information cascade that led to that popu-\nlarity rise. As shown in Figure 18.3 we explored potential increases in discussion\naround several decks, including a variety of Quest decks (Rogue, Hunter, Druid,\nand Warrior), as well as the Secret Mage and Control Priest. While there was a\nsignificant increase in discussion around the Quest Rogue as it became popular,\nmost of the decks we explored did not see any significant increase in discussion.\nFurthermore, the discussions surrounding the Quest Rogue did not follow the\npattern of an information cascade \u2013 rather, they showed a more standard infor-\nmation spread pattern as players realized the deck\u2019s effectiveness. This pattern is\nbest explained by the deck performing well on aggregated data collection sites,\nsuch as MetaStat, rather than a deep and rapid shift in community opinion.\nSelected hearthstone archetype mentions over time between 5 April 2017 and 8 April 2017\nQuestRogue\nQuestWarrior\nQuestHunter\nQuestDruid\nSecretMage\nControlPriest\n0\nTime (HH:MM)\nHearthstone subreddit comment mentionsi in three hour bin\n03:00\n06:00\n09:00\n12:00\n15:00\n18:00\n21:00\n00:00\n03:00\n06:00\n09:00\n12:00\n15:00\n18:00\n21:00\n00:00\n03:00\n06:00\n09:00\n12:00\n15:00\n18:00\n21:00\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nFigure 18.3 Mentions over time for selected Hearthstone decks on Reddit.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The surrounding community for\nmany games represents an extensive online social environment with a variety\nof sources that are used in tandem by large groups of players. Meta-game\nsources provide essential context for interpreting interactions in this social\nenvironment. Social phenomena can be studied in the interactions occurring\nregularly in forums, chat communities, and streaming video websites (e.g.\nTwitch). Behavioral phenomena, ranging from gatekeepers and information\nspread to full-blown information cascades, are likely to exist throughout these\ncommunities. While it was not a focus of our research, many communities\nincorporate subscription services that provide opportunities for exploring\neconomic phenomena as well. Developing methods to interpret community\ninteractions and behavior can provide a large source of data for analyzing\nonline behavior, particularly from a social and behavioral perspective.\nCase Study 3: Investigating Linguistic Indicators of Subcultures\nin Twitch\nOur third and final case study focused on cross-game synchronous community\nbehavior, rather than a specific game, using Twitch.tv. Twitch is a highly\npopular streaming video platform in which game players, or streamers \u2013 many\nof which are highly skilled and popular online personalities \u2013 stream their\ngame activity for an audience. The audience observe the stream live and\noften discuss and donate in chat rooms based on those observations as the\nstreamer continues to play. Twitch and other similar streaming services \u2013 such\nas Japan\u2019s Live Tube and China\u2019s Huya \u2013 provide a live interaction dynamic\nthat is uniquely different from other social media services, in that viewers are\ninteracting, in real time, with a performer (streamer) who is trying to maintain\ntheir attention and contribution. Streamers often customize their game\nselection and in-game behaviors to address interests raised by the audience,\nin an attempt to better engage that audience and draw more donations. This\nbehavior represents a complex social interaction across a variety of users\nwith different roles, dynamics, and behaviors. Further, there is an interactive\neconomic relationship, as many of the streamers rely on contributions from\ntheir viewers as a primary source of income and are highly successful in doing\nso. As previously mentioned, Twitch also provides an advantage for SBE\nresearch in that it provides a truly vast population to observe, with over 100\nmillion unique monthly users. Opportunities for researching SBE phenomena\nwithin this community are plentiful.\nTwitch makes an API available to partner vendors for extracting chat data,\nas well as aggregate data capturing the popularity of streams and the shift-\ning of viewers across those streams. Several online vendors (e.g. http://muxyDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For example,\nMuxy helps streamers understand what activities lead to more or less support\nfrom viewers, leading to better and more profitable decisions in streaming con-\ntent. Muxy has been collecting Twitch chat data and viewership statistics for\nseveral years now (see Table 18.3), including roughly 45 million lines of chat\nper day. Partnering with these vendors provides a unique opportunity for SBE\nresearchers to access this vast source of online behavioral data.\nWorking with Muxy, we acquired limited windows of Twitch data, which we\nused to perform a study using linguistic analysis to identify cultural clusters\nof related channels within the Twitch community. We focused our analysis\non a subset of the messages surrounding donations, which are, in many\ncases, the more important chat messages within a channel (i.e. the messages\nthat are producing a profit for the streamer and therefore likely impacting\nstreaming content the most). Using Python\u2019s Natural Language Toolkit, we\ncleaned the text, removing punctuation, numeric characters, and stop words\nand reducing words to their roots. Next we used term frequency\u2013inverse\ndocument frequency (TFIDF) encoding (Ramos 2003; Zhang et al. 2011) to rate\nthe importance of each term within each channel, characterizing a linguistic\nfeature set for all of the channels in our data window. We then used k-means\nclustering (Kanungo et al. 2002) to effectively split these channels into ten\ncoherent clusters with similar linguistic features, summarized in Figure 18.4\nand Table 18.4.\nThere were a number of interesting features to observe across these clusters.\nWhile some clusters appear to be focused on particular games (e.g. cluster 3\non World of Warcraft), many games clearly were not a differentiating factor forDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Most of\nthe clusters were relatively small (several hundred channels), though there were\nseveral outliers (clusters 4 and 5, in particular). Average viewers per channel and\ndonations per channel were significantly different across a number of clusters;\nthis, in turn, has significant implications for the nature of the communications\nin some of those channels (e.g. clusters that average 200+ viewers per channel\nwill likely portray very different behavior than those with less than 100 viewers\nper channel; clusters with donations exceeding an average of 200 bits are likely\nvery different from those with significantly lower donations).\nNext, we characterized these clusters based on meta-information describing\nbehavioral elements of the chat in these clusters, shown in Figure 18.4. These\nplots show the z-score of each cluster\u2019s average value for subscriber percentage\n(fraction of all chat messages observed that were sent by subscribers, as a\nmeasure of how insular the cluster is), number of chats observed in our sample\nset, length of chat message bodies, and interval between chats. These plots\nhighlight different patterns across the clusters we identified, providing further\nevidence that at least some of these clusters may clear behavioral differences\nin the Twitch community \u2013 behavioral differences that may be indicative of\ndifferent Twitch subcultures.

If these clusters are, indeed, indicative of related subcultures\nwithin Twitch, then it stands to reason that information is more likely to\nspread within these clusters than across them. Further research investigating\nthe details of these clusters \u2013 in particular, who the streamers are and how\nthose streamers interact with viewers \u2013 would be needed to better characterize\nthe underlying cultural differences across the Twitch community.\nThis linguistic analysis represents only a limited subset of the type of\nanalysis that can be done with Twitch data. We also performed several\nstudies investigating the potential of information spread within the Twitch\ncommunity, investigating how rumors and topics spread over time across\nstreams. While there are clearly extensive communications occurring across\nthe streaming community, we were unable to demonstrate evidence of specific\ninformation spread within Twitch. There were a number of confounding\nfactors in this analysis. For example, there are clear confounds in the linguistic\npatterns of the community that make it difficult to track key terms. Community\nmembers often use slang that can be difficult to predefine or use pronouns\nin response to others discussing the topic. Behavioral patterns also confound\nthe interpretation of this data. For example, we observed that many viewers\nremained in a single channel for the majority of each session (on average,\nacross the community, viewers join 1.3 channels per session, despite sessions\nlasting, on average, 45+ minutes); once viewers were watching a particular\nstream, they were unlikely to switch channels and therefore unlikely to be\nthe source of information spread across channels. However, despite this\nconstraint, many viewers \u2013 particularly power users \u2013 remain active in many\nchat channels at once using third-party chat tools. Because of this external\nability to observe and participate in chat, it seems likely that there are a variety\nof connections across channels that we are unable to track using the Twitch\ndata alone.\nFinally, a key limitation of Twitch data (and other streaming video commu-\nnities) is limited insight into the content of the actual streaming video. While\npopular streams remain available online for long periods after they occurred,\nthey are not coded into text or events, and they are not aligned with any other\ndata surrounding the discussions regarding the stream. There has been some\nlimited work extracting image-based events from streams where possible (Pan\net al. 2016), but there has been no comprehensive attempt to encode stream\ncontent. This is important because the stream content could very well be a\nmechanism of information spread (e.g. the streamer could mention a topic or\nrumor to the viewers), and the stream itself can provide essential context to\ninterpret the discussion occurring in chat. Future work developing automated\ntools to encode stream content and align detected events with the timeline\nof the chat data could create significant opportunities for performing more\nadvanced behavioral research studying the interactions between streamers and\nsubscribers.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While there is a clear need for further research to better understand\nbehavioral differences between games and live settings, multiplayer games\nexpress extensive SBE interactions across often large player communities\nthat surpass populations that can be accessed in research settings. Behaviors\ninclude players teaming to achieve game objectives, competing against other\nteams of players, and interacting socially and economically between play\nsessions and events. Researchers can use a variety of data sources to study\nin-game behaviors, including direct access to limited game data from APIs\nprovided by a handful of game companies, indirect access to in-game data\nprovided by observations made in public game spaces (e.g. markets or team\nformation areas in MMOGs), and a host of websites and forums that collect\nmeta-game statistics capturing the popular strategies and approaches used\nwithin the games. While there are clear challenges in extracting and interpret-\ning the data from these sources (interpreting game behaviors; parsing text,\naudio, and video; addressing gaps in data collection), they nevertheless provide\na capability to analyze how people behave in game environments.\nA key area for future research to enhance in-game behavior study would\nbe finding ways to enhance data collection and availability. Partnering with\nsuccessful game companies to share more extensive data in exchange for feed-\nback useful to their game improvement can greatly enhance the potential of\nresearch in this area. Developing learning algorithms to aggregate meta-game\ninformation and use that information to interpret in-game data and events\ncould streamline behavioral analysis. Another approach might be to work with\nemerging game companies directly, funding those companies from an early\nstage to ensure that they make data available to SBE researchers when the\ngame is complete.\nSurrounding game communities also express extensive SBE interactions\nacross large player communities. Behaviors include players discussing and\nspreading information about the game, sharing and developing ideas and\nstrategies, learning from more skilled players and streamers, and earning\nprofit by satisfying and engaging player communities. Researchers can readily\ngain access to a variety of data sources in this area, including public forums\nand content sharing sites, as well as detailed chat and streaming statistics\nfrom real-time sources such as Twitch. This data can be easier to access than\nin-game data and is more suited to analyzing online behavioral phenomena\n(e.g. gatekeeping, information spread and evolution, information cascade).\nHowever, it does not involve the detailed real-time interactions and structure\nthat can be found with in-game data. As with in-game data, there are challenges\nin extracting and interpreting this data, mostly challenges of interpreting text.\nNevertheless, clear and extensive social communities exist for study, someDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Twitch, in particular, has continued\nto grow since its inception and has been evolving its content beyond game\ncommunities with creative, real-life, and other types of streaming content.\nFuture research areas for enhancing the study of game communities should\nfocus on two constraints in current data sources. First, research should focus\non enriching existing data to address under-characterized or under-interpreted\nelements of the source. For example, Twitch analyses would greatly benefit\nfrom automated or crowdsourced tools to code events and behaviors within\nthe streams, ideally aligning those events with activities in the chat data. This\nwould enable more robust analysis of the interactions occurring in Twitch, as\nresearchers could better understand what the viewers are reacting to and how\nthe streamers are reacting to viewers. Similarly, studies using podcasts and\nvideos as data sources could benefit from better automated tools for coding\nevents and behavior within that media. Second, research should focus on align-\ning social behavior in these communities with activity in other social media\nsources. We found that, in many cases, it was unclear how information spread\nwas occurring within the social communities that we were investigating. Align-\ning events across a variety of information sources \u2013 Twitch, Reddit, Twitter,\nand news services \u2013 can create a fundamentally better ability to determine how\ninformation spread is occurring across what is, ultimately, a highly intercon-\nnected social media environment. Finally, while SBE phenomena can clearly\nbe observed within games and game communities, more research is needed\nto understand how these observations can be used as a basis to understand\nanalogous behaviors in live environments.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work described in this paper was funded by DARPA/I2O and performed\nunder AFRL contract number FA8750-17-C-0081.

Davis\nRAND Corporation and Pardee RAND Graduate School Santa Monica, CA 90401, USA\nObjectives and Background\nThere is a growing demand to develop social and behavioral models competent\nto inform decision-making in such diverse domains as counterinsurgency,\npolitical polarization, adversary propaganda campaigns, and public health\nbehaviors. Success will depend on effective use of empirical information drawn\nfrom observation of both online and physical network human behavior. The\nobjectives of this discussion are:\n\u2022 To characterize the current infrastructure of data relevant to behavioral\nmodeling.\n\u2022 To describe progress on methods relevant to behavioral modeling that come\nfrom research on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\n\u2022 To identify shortcomings and challenges with current modeling approaches.\n\u2022 To suggest where advances are needed to address them.\n\u2022 To identify some mechanisms for doing so.\nAn earlier study conducted over three years by the National Research Council\n(Zacharias et al. 2008) presented a comprehensive review of social and behav-\nioral modeling. Most of that analysis remains solid and apt today. Thus, we focus\nprimarily on selected developments over the last 10 years.\nRelevant Advances\nOverview\nTwo trends relevant to this chapter have been notable over the last decade, (i)\nthe burgeoning of data, data sources, and data infrastructure and (ii) AI/ML\nmethods:\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Some recent work has explored MMOGs for understanding\nobserved social behaviors (e.g. identifying patterns observable in the play\nof Pok\u00e9mon Go; Althoff et al. 2016, 2017). More generally, however, it\nseems that the usefulness of MMOG platforms for behavioral insight is\nless than was imagined. MMOGs are interesting troves of data, but the\ninsights appear not to add much to the foundations of behavioral modeling\nresearch. This observation makes sense in hindsight. MMOGs are specific\necosystems of behaviors and contrived ones at that. Researchers can distill\nout interesting patterns of behavior (Tomai et al. 2013), but these are not\nnecessarily generalizable or informative outside the contrived environment.\nArguably, surveys and ethnography (including micro-narratives) are better\nfor eliciting insights on more general behavioral patterns, although they can\nbe unwieldy and intrusive. Ubiquitous social media (SM) platforms seem to\nbe popular as sources of relevant behavioral data for now. We shall discuss\nsome of this in a later section.\nAI/ML methods: As for advances in AI/ML methods, we construe the topic\nbroadly to include:\n\u2022 Adaptive statistics- and optimization-based methods for teaching com-\nputers to identify or exploit regularities in signals (ML or pattern recogni-\ntion).\n\u2022 Expert-, rule-, or logic-based methods for planning, problem solving, or\nknowledge representation.\n\u2022 Models for representing or imitating cognition and decision-making\n(human or otherwise).\nThese topics fall under the useful general definition of AI as the discipline \u201ccon-\ncerned with intelligent behavior in artifacts.1 \u201d\nThe term ML often refers to the more statistically flavored subfields like\nsupervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (RL). Other AI subfields\nrely more on symbolic-based and rule-based methods for tasks like knowledge\nrepresentation and automated planning. Some earlier versions of these were\nknown as expert systems and knowledge-based systems in the 1980s. These\ninclude AI approaches like automated planning solvers, fuzzy cognitive maps\n(FCMs) (Amirkhani et al. 2017), and tree-based methods for parsing semantics\n1 There have been numerous other attempts to define AI canonically. This description is due to\nNilsson (1998). McCarthy (2007) defines intelligence as \u201cthe computational part of the ability to\nachieve goals in the world.\u201d Minsky (1961) gave an enumeration of functions required for such\nintelligence: search, pattern recognition, learning, planning, and induction (or generalization\nfrom observed examples). Any artificially constructed or software-based system performing\ncombinations of these functions to achieve goals in the world will qualify as AI for the purpose of\nour discussion.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nRelevant Advances 445\nand ontologies. Other non-ML strands of AI research include cognitive\nmodeling architectures like BDI (Tambe et al. 1988), Soar (Georgeff et al.\n1998), ACT-R (Anderson 1996), and EPIC (Rubinstein et al. 2001). These have\nbeen useful for enabling tasks like team-based collaboration in robots. The\nvaried nature of social and behavioral modeling requires the full diversity of\nAI methods. We see it as important to consider all of these methods (i.e. to\ninclude what some refer to as both strong and weak strands of AI).2\nNumerous relationships exist among what are sometimes treated as different\nmethods. The authors of the 2008 NRC report generated one depiction of the\nvarious methods and how they relate to each other, as indicated in Figure 19.1.\nAlthough useful for drafting and structuring the large and complex NRC report,\nFigure 19.1 uses a fine-grained disaggregation of modeling approaches, which\nthe report discussed as individual, organizational, and societal (IOS) modeling\ntools. For our purposes, such a disaggregation downplays how deeply intercon-\nnected these approaches sometimes are and sometimes should be. For example,\nthe optimization node (near bottom left) stands alone in the figure. However, a\ncentral theme in current ML methods is learning as optimization (see dashed\nline 1); much of modern ML relies on optimization procedures like stochas-\ntic gradient descent during training. The distinction between ML and statis-\ntics is also not nearly wide as the figure suggests (see dotted line 2). Another\nproblem with such a disaggregation is that it may obscure opportunities for\ninnovation. An important recent innovation in AI/ML, generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs), combines game theory and ML to improve unsupervised\nlearning tasks. Other current innovations include the use of statistical, ML, and\nsocial network analysis methods to infer behavioral patterns (Sapiezynski et al.\n2016).\nThe subsequent sections discuss advances in data sources and AI/ML in more\ndetail.\nAdvances in Data Infrastructure\nNew Sources\nMany new data sources have emerged in the last decade as important ecosys-\ntems for exhibiting and recording behavioral patterns. Each data source\nhas blind spots. On the one hand, a larger ecosystem might be expected to\nincrease the chances of capturing key behavioral information. On the other\nhand, a smaller data ecosystem would require less modeling effort and might\nbe more cost efficient because infrastructure costs burgeon with ecosystem\nsize, perhaps faster than any benefits. Nonetheless, from a purely modeling\n2 Strong AI aspires to computer programs that represent human cognition and achieve\nsignificant aspects of humanlike intelligence.

For example, SM data has become ubiquitous and is now an important\nanalytic tool in national politics. SM platforms also serve as tools for influenc-\ning discourse and for measuring behaviors/influence. They measure individual\ndata and also relational or network data. The ascendance of SM platforms has\nled to a rise in methods and tools for dealing with relational/network/graph\ninformation.\nCellular data records (CDRs), including metadata, are also valuable, espe-\ncially for inferring spatial behavioral preferences. Recent research indicates that\nCDRs are very useful for identifying spatial behaviors relevant to, e.g. migra-\ntion/disaster response (Bengtsson et al. 2011), shopping patterns (De Montjoye\net al. 2015), and personal network affinities. And even limited metadata on\nCDRs can reveal useful patterns (e.g. how much talking between two contacts).\nOther novel data streams include:\n\u2022 Financial records from banks, retail records, and financial technology firms\n(FinTech).\n\u2022 Public and private video surveillance from street cameras and cell phone\nrecordings.\n\u2022 Voice records from AI personal assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Now).\nThe growth in behaviorally relevant data streams mirrors a growing reliance\non tools and devices for mediating behaviors (e.g. GPS for navigation, music\nstreams for mood management, SM platforms for expression). It is now\ncommon to have records or signals of an individual\u2019s plans, intentions, and\nmental states in digital form, especially in affluent cultures with high smart-\nphone adoption. Clark and Chalmers (1998) used the term the extended mind\nto refer to the extension of mental deliberation and cognition outside the (as\nyet) unobservable confines of the human mind. Extended minds with accessible\ndigital data exhausts can be potentially revolutionary for behavioral modeling.\nData ecosystems that include extended minds enable finer-grained behavioral\nmodels that may be able to capture the effects of intention, self-censorship,\nor even ambivalence in a way that models based solely on actual observed\nbehavior cannot. The data ecosystem seems to be growing in that direction.\nEvaluating the Data Ecosystem\nWhatever its primary function may be, for our purposes a data ecosystem\nserves at least a measurement function. Its value in this role depends on at\nleast the following:\n\u2022 Representativeness of the measured population: The measured popula-\ntion (the proxy population) should be representative of the backgroundDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Unfortunately,\nSM platforms generally exhibit significant proxy population mismatch\n(Ruths and Pfeffer 2014). Proxy population mismatch has been implicated\nas the primary reason for the errors observed in SM polls (O\u2019Connor et al.\n2010; Chung and Mustafaraj 2011; Gayo-Avello 2013).\n\u2022 Signal fidelity and resolution: The value of a measurement tool depends on its\nability to indicate signals of interest faithfully. Can the data unambiguously\nindicate behavioral signals of interest? At reasonable effort? Linguistic inter-\nactions (e.g. on SM platforms), for example, may not recognize behavioral\nsignals such as sarcasm without considerable effort to parse the data. Also,\nthe ability to usefully indicate location or geographical behavior depends on\nthe resolution of the location sensors. Signal fidelity also includes questions\nof misrepresentation in observed signals. The ability of agents (human or\norganizational) to harbor unrevealed or unstable preferences and engage in\ngame-theoretic behaviors means that dishonest signaling can be prevalent\nin behavioral contexts. Behavioral models will need to account for misrepre-\nsentation in signals.\n\u2022 Systemic selective nonresponse: Silence \u2013 i.e. the absence of data \u2013 is some-\ntimes extremely informative, especially for active voluntary interactions.\nUnfortunately, the tendency in analysis is to emphasize signal presence over\nabsence. This tendency has been implicated as a potential cause of excessive\npolarization in SM interactions. Studies of political discourse on blogs\nand SM platforms highlight the tendency for hyperpolarized minorities to\ncommandeer discourse and thereby skew platform data streams away from\nunderlying population preferences (Tumasjan et al. 2014).\nTrends\nThe data ecosystem is likely to keep growing, perhaps even exponentially as the\nInternet of things (IoT) takes off. The goal is not just to obtain larger quanti-\nties of data, but also to obtain more raw/unfiltered qualitative and quantitative\ndata, free of the self-report and interpretive biases that often afflict surveys\nand ethnographies. This ecosystem skews heavily toward observational data as\nopposed to controlled trial data that would identify causal connections more\nreadily. This limits the fitness of the data ecosystem for some purposes.\nQuestions of data quality, fitness for use, and access will be key. Much of the\ndata ecosystem exists under different jurisdictions, access/legal restrictions,\nand quality levels. There will likely be a growing demand for methods and\npractices for fusing data sources and patching blind spots in the ecosystem.\nAdvances in AI/ML, discussed below, may help. Besides those discussed\nbelow, the research community is also developing important tools like\nquasi-experimental approaches for inferring causality from observational data\nand fusion methods for fusing heterogeneous data/knowledge/information\nsources. These could be invaluable in time.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Expert systems, rule-based, and solver-based\nAIs continue to be important for problems like planning and knowledge\nrepresentation, but progress there has not gotten as much popular attention.\nWe mention them nonetheless. For example, we present an expert system,\na Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) (Osoba and Kosko (2017)), for modeling\nbehaviors later in this chapter. Fuzzy-based expert systems also have robust\nmechanisms for knowledge fusion. Such fusion approaches hold promise for\naddressing the issue of limited model federation (which we highlight later).\nOther AI subfields like knowledge representation may be useful for specifying\nunderlying behavioral ontologies.\nDeep Learning\nDeep learning (DL) is the most touted recent trend in ML. Traditional connec-\ntionist ML models, by definition, connect nonlinear processing (neural) units\nconfigured in shallow hierarchies or layers to solve classification, regression, or\ndimension reduction tasks. Shallow networks are limited in the complexity of\nfeatures (or combinations of input variables) they can find and use. But deeper\nhierarchies are harder to train. DL leverages advances in computational power\nand statistical learning theory to update the standard connectionist learning\nmodels with deeply stacked layers of processing units. The use of deep stacks\nallows the model to identify complex features in the data that can be useful for\nimproving the model\u2019s performance.\nDepth in learning architectures is an idea that has been considered for much\nof the history of ML research. The main hurdle preventing the exploitation\nof deep architectures has been limits in usable computing power and previ-\nously limited access to relevant training data. ML models solve an optimization\nproblem in the process of learning. The optimization problem is a function\nof the number of tunable parameters in the model. Neural network models\n(both shallow and deep) typically rely on the backpropagation algorithm for\nparameter tuning. Shallow models have fewer parameters than deep models.\nThe difficulty of the optimization task grows exponentially with the number\nof parameters. So deep models can be prohibitively computationally intensive.\nDeep models often also require larger data sets for training. The key factors that\nmake DL models feasible are the existence of large application-relevant dataDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Our previous discussion already highlighted\nthe growth of the ecosystem of behavior-related data. Available computational\npower has also grown explosively.\nMore recent DL advances include the use of time-varying layer weights\nthat allows models to represent temporal or sequential dependence. These\nare called recurrent neural nets (RNNs). These models are useful for mod-\neling time series with temporal correlations. Depth in these models refers\nto the length of time dependence in the signal, not number of layers. Long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) models are a popular type of RNN model. LSTMs\nmaintain an internal input-dependent hidden state that modulates what\ntransformation produces the output signal. LSTMs are used for handwriting\nrecognition in some Windows systems. They have also shown good results in\nthe generation of text for dialog (e.g. chatbots). LSTMs are especially useful\nfor sequence-to-sequence learning tasks (Sutskever et al. 2014) (e.g. machine\nlanguage translation like the Google Neural Machine Translation, GNMT; Wu\net al. 2016).\nThe DL community has also made widespread use of the convolutional\nneural network (CNN) architecture for video, image, speech, and text tasks.\nCNNs are neural networks with layers that apply biologically inspired weighted\nlocal averages (or convolutions) to input signal fields. These weighted aver-\naging schemes are one way of incorporating sequential dependence. CNNs\nhave proven especially effective at image and audio tasks. A recent empirical\nanalysis (Bai et al. 2018) argues that CNN-based models may be better than\nRNN-based models as default models for handling sequence learning tasks.\nThe value of DL for social and behavioral modeling lies mainly in the ability\nof DL models to convert a larger portion of the data ecosystem into meaningful\nbehavioral signals. The semantics of images and videos used in social interac-\ntions become more accessible using appropriate DL models.3\nLanguage data is behaviorally meaningful. But language has historically\nbeen hard to model. The next section talks about natural language processing\n(NLP). Much of the recent advances in NLP are due to the application of DL\nmodels to language tasks. DL has also fostered the development of computing\narchitecture for scalable computation on large data sets. But DL models\nthemselves have not had a large footprint so far as tools for modeling social\nbehavior directly.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nThe most important AI improvement relevant to behavioral modeling over the\nlast half decade has probably been the maturation of NLP. This includes text\nmining, topic modeling, sentiment inference, speech recognition, machine\n3 DL is also appealing because it is often possible to implement portfolios (or federations) of\nmodeling subtasks entirely within the DL paradigm.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Behavioral cues in language use are now observable.\nCaliskan-Islam et al. (2015) demonstrate an example of behavioral modeling\n(identifying telltale patterns of language use) based on NLP.\nTopic modeling (Blei and Lafferty 2006; Blei 2012) has been particularly\nuseful for measuring trends in what is otherwise unstructured data. Blei\ngives an example of the use of NLP methods to track publishing behaviors in\nacademic fields (Blei 2012). Topic modeling tools have also been indispensable\nin the analysis of micro text corpora from SM platforms (e.g. short tweets).\nSome SM studies use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for NLP (Gross and\nMurthy 2014).\nOther modes of text analysis are needed. Topic modeling is a strictly\nstatistical analysis of text with limited use of semantics or lexical structure.\nIt treats text as pure symbols with no meaning separate from the statistical\nco-occurrence patterns learned from corpora. Significant insight can be gained\nfrom this purely symbolic analysis (as its current use in text mining indicates),\nbut topic modeling results still require significant human interpretation to\nidentify and understand context-dependent meanings. Automated tools for\nsemantic, lexical, and lexicographic analysis of larger bodies of discourse can\nimprove social and behavioral (SB) models. The rise of NLP suites of tools\nlike word2vec and GloVe represents increasing capacity for the algorithmic\ncomprehension of text meaning. They are currently good at solving analog-\nical questions \u2013 arguably the minimal task required to indicate semantic\ncomprehension.\nAutomated machine translation (AMT) is another NLP domain with\nsignificant innovation. Google recently introduced the GNMT (Wu 2016) for\nlanguage translation using an end-to-end neural network framework trained\nin a purely data-driven fashion (no pre-coded language rules) (Sutskever et al.\n2014).\nAdversarial Training for Unsupervised Learning\nThe discovery of adversarial training approaches may hold the most promise\nfor future social-behavioral modeling and related AI. Goodfellow et al.\nfirst formalized stable adversarial training in their development of GANs\n(Goodfellow et al. 2014; Radford et al. 2015). The training approach takes\ninspiration from game theory and minimax decision-making.\nThe standard statistical learning approach begins with training data and a\nparameterized model (e.g. regressions, perceptions, support vector machines,\nor neural networks). The goal is to learn a desired behavior encoded in the\ntraining data. Changing the model parameters changes the behavior of the\nmodel. Learning algorithms encode the behavior to be learned as critical points\nof an objective function over the model\u2019s parameter space. Statistical learning\n(clustering, fitting, classification, regression being the major forms) thus oftenDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This mode of automated learning works well for problems in\nwhich the desired behavior is reasonably articulable as objective functions,\ne.g. image/facial recognition and some aspects of NLP. This is essentially a\nteacher\u2013student learning model.\nLearning to generate subtle but sometimes crucial behaviors from data sets\ncan be much harder. For example, generating believable super-resolved images,\nsocial networks, conversations, or even facial expressions is difficult. The key\ntheme in these tasks is the need to learn implicit models of data generation\n(Diggle and Gratton 1984; Mohamed and Lakshminarayanan 2016). These are\nmodels for which the generative structure of the data is apparent post hoc but\nnot easy to articulate a priori. And thus, the process of learning the structure\nconsists of imitative model adaptation in response to a repeated game of dis-\ncriminating between examples.\nAdversarial training proceeds as a game between two agents: the generator\nand the discriminator. The generator\u2019s goal is to learn to produce synthetic\nsamples that are representative of the training data. The discriminator\u2019s goal\nis to learn to discriminate between the generator\u2019s output and samples from\nthe training data. Both agents escalate in the course of training to the point\nwhere the generator has learned to behave indistinguishably from the training\ndata. The learning model is related to actor-critic RL model (Pfau and Vinyals\n2016). Adversarial training provides a way for AI systems to do better in\ngames-against-nature scenarios or in adversarial scenarios (e.g. individuals\nare seeking to hide information or even mislead). Such training could enable\nagents in social science models to learn behaviors that are not easy to encode\nor explain (e.g. identifying fake news or recognizing patterns in the presence\nof efforts to hide them or deceive).\nReinforcement Learning\nRL is a branch of statistical ML focused on teaching agents how to act to\nachieve goals in an uncontrolled environment (Figure 19.2) (Sutton and Barto\n1998 [second ed., forthcoming]). It has its origins in research on control theory,\nrobotics, automated planning, and behavioral psychology. RL\u2019s key defining\nfeatures are the explicit modeling of the environment, the built-in emphasis on\nexploration, the sparsity of evaluative feedback to guide the agent\u2019s learning,\nand the learning of action policies from experience or data. The rise of RL is a\nresponse to the inadequacies of supervised learning for planning-style tasks\nin which the value of real-time actions derives from their downstream effects\nrather than from immediate rewards. Planning is an integral part of human\nsocial behavior. And we need models that can capture such behaviors.\nThe maturation of RL enables the development of large-scale agent-based\nmodels (ABMs) with adaptive intelligent agents possibly in adversarialDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Developments in RL may allow for more adaptive\nABM models of intelligent human behavior in complex adaptive systems.\nEmulating Human Biases and Bounded Rationality\nAnother important area of work on AI/ML deals with methods for learning\ntrue or revealed preferences. This is important for behavioral modeling\nbecause self-report data and behaviorally revealed preferences often diverge\n(Rudder 2014). Biases in preferences drive many social behaviors. Research on\ncognitive biases, as reviewed in Kahneman (2011), shows that biases perform\nuseful functions even if they sometimes lead users astray. More specifically,\nrecent work by Pita et al. (2010) on security games shows the importance of\naccurately modeling human bounded rationality (Simon 1996 [first edition,\n1969]; Simon and Newell 1962). Eliminating heuristic biases (or even irrational\naspects of decision-making) from social-behavioral simulation models may\nreduce their descriptive accuracy. The social simulations need to reflect true\nbiases and preferences.\nResearchers are beginning to develop simple games and other methods\nto discover hidden preferences. These may help address the NRC concern\nabout reproducing nonrational agent behaviors in models (Zacharias et al.\n2008, p. 359). It is also important, as discussed in the literatures on deterrence\n(National Research Council 2014, p. 37) and wicked problems (Rittel and\nNoble 1989) to recognize that humans (all of us) often do not actually have\nthe stable utility functions postulated by both rational actor theory and usual\nversions of bounded rationality theory. We often discover or develop values\nin the processes of human interaction and experience. Limited rationality\nis sometimes used to refer to problems that go beyond those of bounded\nrationality (Davis 2014b, p. 6). Such problems include mental health problems\n(as when leaders are perhaps depressed and using alcohol or drugs and are\nsometimes paranoid) and emotion-driven irrational acts (op cit).\nTrends\nMost of the AI/ML methods highlighted seem to have more promise as tools\nfor comprehending novel data streams than as new approaches to social and\nbehavioral modeling.

But the addition of heterogeneous data comprehension and\nfusion capabilities to the behavioral modeling repertoire is substantial boon, if\nnothing else.\nPerhaps a key limitation of many currently popular AI/ML methods is the\noverrepresentation of feed-forward model structures. This limits the use of\nsuch methods to subtasks of the behavioral modeling enterprise (e.g. NLP).\nTraining statistical models that feature feedbacks can be daunting or unsta-\nble. But many interesting behaviors involve significant amounts of feedback.\nThe feed-forward emphasis also inhibits the representation of chaotic dynamics\nthat can often occur in behavioral models (e.g. in simple predator\u2013prey models;\nSchaffer 1985), especially complex ones. The introduction of ML models like\nadversarial training and sequence learning marks a growing emphasis on simple\nfeedback in ML models. Some less popular AI models like FCMs for modeling\ncausal networks also model feedback since causation often features feedback\nloops.\nData and Theory for Behavioral Modeling\nand Simulation\nPrefacing Comments on Fundamentals\nCertain foundational questions must be addressed if we are to model and\nsimulate social behavior. These include how to represent aspects of behavior,\nhow to understand and establish validity, and how to compose models from\nsmaller models (model federation). We do not address all such questions here.\nHere, we focus on the question of how to relate theory and data.\nThe relationship between theory and data demands further scrutiny because\nof the advent of big data. Advances in AI/ML, driven in part by the glut of\nbig data sources, have predisposed modelers to focus on data as the primary\nfoundation for building and validating models of behavior. This data focus\nis evident in the emphasis on predictive power in much of modern ML\napproaches to modeling. The growth of ML modeling approaches is arguably\ndue to the ability to convert measures of predictive validity into concrete\nmathematical objective functions (e.g. classification accuracy for classification,\nmean squared error for regressions) that are directly amenable to optimization\nmethods. Explanatory power, if considered at all, has been a secondary\ngoal \u2013 sometimes with the rationale that increases in predictive power surely\noccur due to increases in the intrinsic or effective explanatory power of the\nmodel. Modelers sometimes (implicitly) resort to this rationalization even if\nthat increased explanatory power is difficult to verify because the model isDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A purely data-driven modeling approach would be inadequate and\npotentially misguided.\nFor Want of Good Theory\u2026\nResearchers have multiple examples highlighting the inadequacies of purely\ndata-driven models in complex domains. Recent discussion (Jonas and Kording\n2017; The Economist 2017) argues that many data-driven neuroscience tech-\nniques aimed at uncovering brain architecture and function are misguided.\nOne example involves the common approach of localizing function in the brain\nbased on observations of function loss or impairment due to localized brain\nlesions. Jonas and Kording apply modern data-driven neuroscience techniques\nto an older simpler microprocessor. The goal was to reconstruct the known\narchitecture of the microprocessor by analysis of measured signals and local-\nized impairments or interventions \u2013 the way a neuroscientist might seek to\nreconstruct the architecture of brain. The methods failed to identify high-level\nstructures (e.g. the arithmetic and logic unit, ALU) fundamental to explaining\nthe microprocessor\u2019s function.5 The failure of the methods at identifying cru-\ncial structures in a simpler system raises questions about the ability of these\nmethods to make sense or explain brain functions physiologically.\nAn older critique of heavily data-driven models of behavior is Chomsky\u2019s\ncritique (Chomsky 1959; Fodor 1965) of B.F. Skinner\u2019s model of learned verbal\nbehavior. Skinner had put forward a theoretical model of language acquisition\nin which infants learn language entirely from experience filtered through\na sparse operant conditioning learning framework. Chomsky argued that\nSkinner\u2019s theory of verbal behavior was wrong because the stimulus\u2013response\nmechanism it hinged on was too sparse to explain the speed of language\nacquisition or the observed complexities of language use (e.g. latent learning\nin no-reward scenarios). Chomsky pointed out that studying verbal behavior\nsolely based on input (stimuli and reinforcements) and output (verbal utter-\nances) observables is incomplete since it ignores complex selective mechanisms\nthat mediate verbal behavior. The infinite variation and novelty in language\nuse makes it unlikely that verbal behavior is the product of generalization\n4 A number of model selection instruments (e.g. the Akaike information and the Bayesian\ninformation criteria) try to incentivize simpler (and therefore less opaque?) models by penalizing\nmodels with larger parameter spaces.\n5 Mathematically, a core problem is that statistical methods do not discover model fragments\nthat are not part of the specification used.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

He further argued that the human facility\nwith language likely exists because of an innate grammar acquisition model (a\ntheory of behavior) more complex than operant conditioning.\nChomsky\u2019s criticisms arguably apply to other models of complex human\nbehavior besides verbal behavior. Efforts at building social and behavioral\nmodels are subject to similar misspecification risks. Data-driven behavioral\nmodels, without the benefit of strong hints from plausible social science\ntheories of behavior, may have poor explanatory power \u2013 especially in nonlin-\near systems. The statistical models may not even be useful for postdiction or\npost hoc sensemaking. To be sure, fully theory-driven modeling can also be\nseriously misguided.\nUsual statistical analysis use specifications.\nIn an ideal situation with complete relevant theory and perfect and com-\nplete data, the data validates the theories, and the theories provide an explana-\ntory/interpretive frame for the data. The current situation, however, is very\ndifferent: we have a lot of data, but it is often imperfect, incomplete, and/or\nbiased, and we have a great many social science theories, which are often nar-\nrow, fragmentary, unvalidated, and certainly not settled. 6\nKey Questions: How do we design models that are valid for purpose and\nrepresentative of the relevant reality when the data and theories are unsettled?\nWhat is the right balance of theory and data focus in models? And what are the\nbest practices on weaving the two together effectively?\nThe Scope of Theory and Laws for Behavioral Models\nSome earlier literature on the validity of modeling and simulation (M&S) often\nsupposed that complete systems understanding is the key to good models.\nIn other words, good models should have structural validity. This is not\nnecessarily true; good theories are necessary, but they often do not need to be\nperfect, complete, or structurally isomorphic to the real system. This point will\n6 It is notable that in the social sciences, theory may correspond to nothing more than a\nsingle-variable hypothesis, such as \u201cMore of X should tend to increase Y,\u201d whereas in the physical\nsciences, theory often (but not always) is regarded as that which pulls together a great many\nconsiderations coherently. Thus, in conversation, a physical scientist may use the word theory in a\nvery positive way, whereas a social scientist may regard someone else\u2019s theory skeptically as\nnothing more than yet another hypothesis to be tested.

Similarly, animals do not need a full\nunderstanding of physical theories (e.g. Newton\u2019s laws or quantum mechanics)\nto thrive.\nSo also, an agent\u2019s internal models of and behaviors in complex systems need\nnot be perfect. They should, however, reflect effective theories (Randall 2017)\nto guide their behavior in the system over time. These are simplified mental\nmodels that have proven sufficiently useful for guiding the agent\u2019s actions even\nthough they are not fully accurate or complete. These idealized mental models\nare useful untruths (Appiah 2017).\nKey Questions: Is the social science research community able to identify\nwhich theories of social behavior are effective theories vs. accurate theories vs.\njust-interesting-but-invalid theories? Is there a stable mechanism or framework\nfor making this distinction? How useful is data for this purpose?\nThe Model-Inquiry Gap\nThis value of effective theories for useful modeling suggests a diagnostic\nconcept for modeling practice: the model-inquiry gap. This is the conceptual\ngap between the level of a model\u2019s representation of the world and the level of\nanalysis the model is meant to inform. It is one aspect of estimating how well a\nmodel matches its purpose. One example of a large model-inquiry gap would\nbe using a quantum mechanical model in an attempt to answer questions about\nplanetary motion. It would simply be inappropriate. An example of a small\nmodel-inquiry gap (i.e. a good match) might be using a social network model to\nstudy individual influence in an organization. Where a broad gap exists, using\nthe model (if it can be used at all) will require vastly more effort, to include\nextensive calibration if good and comprehensive data exists, than if a suitably\nsimpler model were used. Effective theories act as tools for reducing the gap\nwith lower effort. This is also the reason that recent discussion of Department\nof Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) modeling for defense planning decried overdependence\non detailed models and urged greater emphasis on simpler models (with more\ndetailed models used to study selected issues in more detail, which is often\ncrucial). The lesson is not to choose simple rather than complex, but to have\nthe right family of models for both broad analysis and for in-depth analysis\nwhen necessary (Davis 2014a).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

With effective theories it is possible to create models and simulations of\npoorly understood systems that are valuable and valid for a purpose (Zacharias\net al. 2008). Comparison of game-theoretic models in Stackelberg games (used\nas a proxy model for critical infrastructure defense) and empirical data showed\nthat humans deviate significantly but predictably from rational expectations.\nFailing to incorporate bounded rationality in behavioral models leads to sub-\noptimal or invalid models (Pita et al. 2010).\nKey Questions: What are the standard or best-practice approaches for\nequipping behavioral models with the kinds of heuristic decision-making\nmechanisms that humans demonstrate? When is it important to do so?\nConsider the preceding discussion as a discussion on the depth of a model\u2019s\ntheories. What about the breadth of a model? What is the relevant scope of a\nmodel? Most systems of interest are subsystems of larger systems. There will\nbe interactions within the hierarchy of systems. Identifying which interactions\nand systems are relevant to the modeler\u2019s interest is not always obvious. Casting\ntoo wide a net leads to large unwieldy models. An overly parsimonious model\nmay be too incomplete to be valid for purpose.\nHerbert Simon argues that most systems are nearly decomposable feder-\nations of subsystems (Simon 1996 [first edition, 1969]; Simon 2002). This is\nbecause there are fitness benefits to abstracting away or encapsulating func-\ntions into subsystems rather than having a single, entangled monolithic system\nof functions (Simon 2002). Near-decomposability tends to improve adaptabil-\nity and reduce fragility. This suggests that composite social-behavioral models\nneed to be well designed so that they have the benefits of near-decomposability.\nWe are much less sanguine about the role of federated models than was the\nNRC report (Zacharias et al. 2008). Model composition will be important for\nparticular purposes, but the tendency to adopt approved model federations\nwith approved input data should be fiercely resisted because the problems of\ninterest tend to be dominated by uncertainty. Analysis in such cases needs to\nbe uncertainty sensitive.\nKey Questions: When should federated models be encouraged, and, in those\ncases, how should they be designed and used?\n7 Herbert Simon\u2019s bounded rationality refers to making decisions under constraints like\nimperfect or incomplete information, limited or imperfect computational capacity, and limited\ntime \u2013 i.e. the kinds of constraints that almost always apply in real life.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

System data here refers to measurement of the\nsystem\u2019s state. The typical roles of system data in modeling are tuning models,\nvalidating models, generating hypotheses of underlying system behavior, and\nfinally establishing the appropriate inputs for a given application of simulation.\nSystem data in our context includes behavioral or social data.\nThe emerging big data ecosystem is creating a steady stream of behavioral\ndata (Ohm 2010). A significant body of data-driven work exists on mobility\nbehavior (De Montjoye et al. 2013), financial behavior (De Montjoye et al. 2015),\nand personal networks (Sapiezynski et al. 2016). The goal of these is to help\nmake sense of how people behave or make decisions. Such insights would be\ncommercially useful for improving targeted advertising and other applications\nthat deal with transitions from user intent to user action. Much of this work\nleverages newer data-driven methods to highlight patterns. But they tend to\nfall short on making sense of the patterns they find.\nThis sensemaking is important if behavioral models are to reach their poten-\ntial. Social and behavioral simulations will need to bridge the theory\u2013data gap.\nCharacterizing behavior without a theoretical frame is often not enough to\ndetermine proper interventions. And positing theories of user behavior without\nempirical support is not enough.\nKey Questions: Which data-driven methods are most useful for sensemaking?\nWhich methods have limited sensemaking value? What would a research pro-\ngram focused on developing methods for sensemaking look like?\nSome of the issues have been discussed recently in a volume summarizing\nresults of DoD\u2019s human, social, cultural, and behavioral (HSCB) modeling pro-\ngram (Egeth et al. 2014) (see, e.g. Chapter 10).\nCausal inference is another consideration that motivates the need for a the-\nory frame around behavioral data. Good causal theories, however, must include\nvariables and relationships that are often omitted. For example, some theo-\nries and formalisms do not include feedback cycles. Also, the variables used\nfor hypothesis testing statistical work are often not very appropriate for causal\nexplanation because they are poor proxies for the real variables of interest and\nbecause they sometimes lock in a simplistic framework (e.g. linear dynamics\nand trivialized rational actor decision-making).8\n8 Attempting to use quantitative social science theories to inform policy-level issues is criticized\nin Davis (2011, p. 326ff ), drawing on criticisms from within the social science community itself\n(Sambanis 2004; Kalyvas 2008). A major problem is the tendency for the quantitative work to be\naggregated and too little informed by factors known to be important from more micro-level case\nstudies.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

What is the state of scalable methods (quasi-\nexperimental methods) for extracting causal relationships from observational\ndata? Are the limits of causal inference on observational data going to diminish\nwith a larger ecosystem? Or are these limits fundamental? Are there robust\nscalable ways of eliciting causal insight from experts?\nBridging the Theory\u2013Data Gap\nInitial Observations\nModels are sometimes starkly dichotomized models as theory driven vs. data\ndriven, but it is better to think in terms of a spectrum:\n\u2022 On one end, the theory-driven approach is said to rely on deductive reason-\ning \u2013 using general system laws to infer behavior in specific instances.\n\u2022 At the other end, the data-driven approach is said to rely more on induc-\ntive reasoning \u2013 using a collection of specific observations to abstract out\ngoverning laws and relationships.\n\u2022 Abductive reasoning is a somewhat intermediate mode of reasoning.\nAbductive reasoning starts from a portfolio of general hypotheses or laws\nand proceeds to rank them based on how well they match observed data.\nAbduction is concerned with making inferences to the best explanation. This\nbridges the gap between theory-focused and data-focused approaches.9\nThe approach we urge is shifting the balance in social-behavioral search from\na statistics- and-data-driven dominance toward a healthier abductive approach\nin which theory informs data analysis and data analysis informs theory in a con-\ntinuous dynamic tension. This corresponds as well to urging a relatively greater\nemphasis on causal modeling rather than correlational work.10\nThinking now of M&S, an agent reasoning in an abductive mode would\nobserve state and have a number of hypotheses to explain it. It would then\nact using a hypothesis (or theory) that is as simple as possible for explanation,\nbut no simpler (an expression of Occam\u2019s razor attributed to Einstein). The\nfirst part (as simple as possible) encourages models that are more likely to\nbe generalizable to cover new observations (Pearl 1978). The second part\n(but no simpler) is important because, especially when data is incomplete\nand imperfect, it may be very important to persist in using some model\n9 Charles S. Peirce discussed abductive inference (Peirce and Buchler 1940).\n10 We recognize, of course, that many papers that have been written about how, allegedly, cycles\nwithin system models make the concept of causality untenable, how everything is correlational\nbecause we do not know the ultimate true theory if it exists, and so on. This is not the place to\ndiscuss such matters.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This full process, from observations to best explanation, is\na better description of what scientists do when they seek out governing laws\nof nature. Abductive reasoning is a less structured process that draws on both\ndata and theory; this lack of structure has inhibited its automation.\nKey Questions: Are there modeling approaches that enable flexible explo-\nration of alternative explanations of observations? Which analytic techniques\nbetter represent the abductive process? What could it mean to foster a capacity\nof programmable abductive model building?\nThe preceding sections discuss criteria for evaluating social simulations. It\nmay be useful to examine currently implemented social simulations through\nthe lens of these criteria. These simulations are rudimentary, but they can\nserve as useful caricatures of how to use data to train simulation models in a\ntheory-informed manner.\nExample 1: Modeling Belief Transmission: Memes and Related Issues at the\nMicro Level\nThe Model The transmission of beliefs is a social behavior of considerable\ninterest. Often transmission occurs in \u201cmemes,\u201d units such as ideas, behaviors,\nor styles (Dawkins 2016 [first ed., 1976]). Memes include information, con-\nspiracy theories, aspects of individual identity, and even language. The flexible\nand structurally valid model of belief transmission can have significant policy\nrelevance for questions about the transmission of health, voting, radicalization,\nand other types of behaviors.\nBehaviors and incentives for behaviors can evolve spontaneously over time\nand in response to an individual\u2019s information diet. An important explanatory\nmodel of belief transmission sees an individual or agent\u2019s beliefs and actions as\na function of the beliefs and actions of members of the agent\u2019s social networks.\nSocial behavior or culture propagates through social networks. Every person\nbelongs to multiple networks, but infectiousness of such memes depends on\n11 Some twentieth-century physicists noted candidly that their theoretical work, the stuff of\ntheir Nobel Prizes, sometimes was driven by the beauty of the mathematics they articulated\nrather than at-the-time empirical information (Dirac 1939; Weinberg 1994). At a more mundane\nlevel, some aspects of social-behavioral theory are intuitively very persuasive. If so, they should\nnot be omitted without strong empirical disconfirmation. Interestingly, in DoD\u2019s modeling of\ncombat, many operations researchers have often omitted the factor of morale because it is\ndifficult to measure and subjective. Senior officers, historians, and some modelers have\nrecognized such practice as absurd.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Teenagers are more likely\nto adopt behaviors observed in their peer network. We can illustrate the phe-\nnomenon on a simple model based on social networks equipped with a provi-\nsional theory of transmission.\nOur simple model draws on theories of belief fixation and the intersectional\nnature of identity. Consider a model that is concerned with only a single binary\nbelief. Belief fixation measures how strongly an agent\u2019s belief state resists chang-\ning when confronted with new information.12 We represent doubt about the\nbelief using Bayesian priors. Fixation refers to how strongly the agent resists\nchanging its beliefs in light of new information. Inquiry is the process by which\nthe agent moves from doubt to certainty. We operationalize this using the con-\ncept of intersectionality: an agent resolves doubt by examining the beliefs of\nneighboring agents in a set of personal networks (e.g. family, friends, work-\nplace, and community). The strength of an agent\u2019s impulse to switch belief is a\nweighted function of the fraction of each such network with belief contrary to\nthe agent\u2019s. This models Peirce\u2019s appeal to authority mode of changing belief;\nthe authority here is the weighted plurality of beliefs in an agent\u2019s local net-\nworks. It also reflects the function of social influence in opinion formation. In\na simple agent-based simulation, then, an agent\u2019s belief regarding the issue in\nquestion (the meme) depends on its prior belief one time step earlier and the\nbeliefs of the other agents in his network.13 If the initial beliefs of all agents\nare specified and the simulation is then executed, the fraction of the agents\nbelieving the meme will change over time as illustrated in (Figure 19.3).\nFor the illustration, we assumed that each agent was a member of four net-\nworks, as shown, the networks being of different characters. This particular\nsimulation shows a particularly rare belief/behavior (initial prevalence at 1%)\nspreading through the population rapidly and then randomly oscillating in fre-\nquency around 45% (Figure 19.4). The illustrative simulation shows the meme\ncaught on. This is the result of the parameter values assumed in the model.\nWith other choices, the meme would never catch on, or might propagate for\n12 Peirce\u2019s conception (Peirce 1877; Peirce and Buchler 1940) was that an agent\u2019s main goal was\ncertainty, with the state of doubt being inherently repugnant.\n13 In equation terms,\np k (t) \u223c Beta (\u2212\u2192\ud835\udefc k (t) \u22c5 \u2212\u2192w + \ud835\udf06 \u22c5 \ud835\udeff(X k (t \u2212 1)), \u2212\u2192\n\ud835\udefd k (t) \u22c5 \u2212\u2192w + \ud835\udf06 \u22c5 \ud835\udeff(1 \u2212 X k (t \u2212 1)))\nwhere Xk (t) \u223c Bernoulli(pk (t)),\n\ud835\udefck, j(t) = number of agents connected to k in the jth network who believe\n\ud835\udefdk, j(t) = number of agents connected to k in the jth network\nwho do not believe\nw j = relative weight or leverage of belief in the jth network\n\ud835\udf06 = inertia of prior beliefDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Thus, even this very simple model can \u2013 by\nvarying parameters \u2013 generate quite a range of behaviors. Conversely, if behav-\nior is observed, then the model parameters can be inferred.14\nEvaluating the Model The belief transmission model and similar such models\ncan be useful for social and behavioral M&S. This is an example of a micro-level\nmodel, specifically a micro-level ABM. Since it revolves around a single belief,\nit might prove simplistic when comparing it with full models of human\ndecision-making. In some cases, however, it might be useful for exploring and\nbuilding intuition about belief transmission about a particular meme.\nThe question of validity is a primary concern for such models. And validity\nhas different dimensions (Davis et al. 2012). The first dimension is the ques-\ntion of structural validity: does the model actually mimic the key processes\nin the transmission of memes in the real world? The simplicity of the model\nsuggests that it most likely does not capture all relevant features of the real pro-\ncess. It is an open question whether it captures enough of the relevant features.\nAnother dimension is the question of replicative validity: does the model repli-\ncate overall behavior under identical initial conditions? The data ecosystem may\nbe becoming robust enough to tackle questions of replicative and structural\n14 The illustrative model is an example of Markov random field (MRF) equipped with Bayesian\ntemporal update dynamics.

SM platforms and CDRs can provide useful estimates\nof both multimodal social network relationships and the memes propagating\nthrough these networks. Using these data sources could also enable the model\nto account for dynamic networks and shock events. It is thus possible, in theory\nand with careful calibration, to compare meme transmission in this model with\ntransmission in the real world.\nThe questions of structural and replicative validity are not synonymous\nfor ABMs. An ABM may mimic system processes closely and still fail to\nreplicate observed macro-level system behavior.

The question of validity for ABMs is an area of\ncontinuous research effort.\nExample 2: Static Factor-Tree Modeling of Public Support for Terrorism\nThe Model Behavioral models may also work at a more macroscopic level.\nConsider, for example, a model intended to examine the factors that promote\nor inhibit the public support for insurgency and terrorism (PSOT). The macro-\nscopic nature of the question suggests that the effective theories governing\nthe model should be macro level to achieve a low model-inquiry gap. A large\n2009 DoD study drew on a comprehensive review of social science relating\nto counterterrorism to construct a composite qualitative model in the form\nof a factor tree (a kind of primitive but broad static causal model) of, e.g.\npublic support for terrorism (Paul 2009). A later study tested it empirically\n(qualitatively) and refined it slightly (Davis et al. 2012) (Figure 19.5). The work\nwas synthetic across different fragmentary social science theories.\nA next step (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2013) went beyond the purely pictorial\ndescription to build a computational version of the factor tree but with numer-\nous degrees of freedom to accommodate different possibilities about how the\nfactors in fact combine. That is, the model incorporated not just different lev-\nels of resolution as indicated in the tree, but also different structures for the\ncombining relationships. The intent was to enrich the ability to discuss causal\nphenomena at a point in time. The price paid was deliberate suppression of\ndynamics. Although simple enough to present in a single page, the factor tree\nintegrates a great deal of knowledge \u2013 moving discussion away from what the\nalleged primary reason for public support is to the many factors that affect it,\nwith the relative significance of factors varying from one context to another\nas expected. The same factors appeared in subsequent case studies (i.e. the\nqualitative theory had significant generality), but \u2013 as predicted \u2013 the relative\nsignificance of the factors varied with case (Davis et al. 2012).\nThe computational version of the model allowed generating broad outcome\nmaps showing the circumstances (contextual variables) under which public\nsupport would be expected to be very low, low, medium, high, or very high\n(Figure 19.6) (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2013).\nAdding Dynamics with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Osoba and Kosko (2017) extend the\nsimulation capacity of the Davis\u2013O\u2019Mahony model by adapting the factor tree\ninto an FCM.

The relevant entities are\npopulations of people, not individual agents or people. More specifically,\nthe models operate on the population-level prevalence of beliefs and the\ninteractions among these beliefs. The model\u2019s focus on common beliefs makes\nthe validation process more complex. The interaction between beliefs and the\nmore observable actions or events requires careful calibration in this context\n(and in more general contexts). The existing data ecosystem currently does\nnot (and most likely will not) inform most of the model variables. We would\nneed careful surveys and ethnographies to measure the pervasiveness of the\nrelevant beliefs or factors. Thus, tests of validity (replicative or predictive)\nwould be hard to implement especially for the dynamic FCM-PSOT model.\nThe value of these models is mainly as tools to characterize and simulate\nscenarios based on carefully vetted expert knowledge about causal links. The\ncorrectness of the elicited expertise wholly underpins the structural validity\nof both models. The fusion capability for FCMs means probabilistic limit laws\nguarantee the structural validity of the final FCM if a large number of indepen-\ndent experts present individual FCMs for fusion.\nConclusion and Highlights\nThis discussion has outlined key changes and trends in the data and modeling\nenvironment since the NRC report of 2011. The methods highlighted focused\non the AI/ML domain. The data conversation examined the emerging ecosys-\ntem of data streams with content relevant to behavioral modeling. SM data\nstands out as a high-leverage stream. It is just one part of the ecosystem though.\nThe extended mind trend (in which individuals\u2019 cognition and mental states\nleave digital footprints) suggests that the behavioral data ecosystem may be able\nto record formerly unobservable useful signals.\nThe AI/ML discussion highlighted a series of innovations that could be of\nvalue to behavioral modeling. The innovations seem to hold the most promise\nfor unlocking or combining information from complex or heterogeneous data\nstreams (e.g. language, images, video). We demonstrate the value of the FCM\nAI approach for developing an expert system model of macro-level behavior.\nThis suggests that older expert-system-style AI methods may hold promise for\nbehavioral modeling. Alternatively, RL may be of value to adaptive or dynamic\nABMs of behavior. And adversarial training may be useful for capturing or sim-\nulating patterns that are difficult to articulate.\nThe rest of the chapter focused on more fundamental questions about the\ninterplay between theory and data in efforts to model and simulate humanDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We identified a series of questions that will need answers if capacity\nfor behavioral M&S is to grow. We identified questions on the following:\nThe interplay between data and theory:\n1. How do we design models that are valid for purpose and representative of\nthe relevant reality when the data and theories are unsettled? What is the\nright balance of theory and data focus in models? And what are the best\npractices on weaving the two together effectively?\n2. Is the social science research community able to identify which the-\nories of social behavior are effective theories vs. accurate theories vs.\njust-interesting-but-invalid theories? Is there a stable mechanism or\nframework for making this distinction? How useful is data for this purpose?\n3. Are there modeling approaches that enable flexible exploration of alternative\nexplanations of observations? Which analytic techniques better represent\nthe abductive process? What could it mean to foster a capacity for pro-\ngrammable abductive model building?\nModeling practice:\n4. What are the standard or best-practice approaches for equipping behav-\nioral models with the kinds of heuristic decision-making mechanisms that\nhumans demonstrate? When is it important to do so?\n5. When should federated models be encouraged, and, in those cases, how\nshould they be designed and used? We are skeptical about how broad the\nvalue of model federation.\n6. Which data-driven methods are most useful for sensemaking? Which meth-\nods have limited sensemaking value (DL)? What would a research program\nfocused on developing methods for sensemaking look like?\nCausal inference:\n7. The data ecosystem skews strongly toward observational data collection.\nWhat is the state of scalable quasi-experimental methods for extracting\ncausal relationships from observational data? Are the limits of causal\ninference on observational data going to diminish with a larger ecosystem?\nAre there robust scalable ways of eliciting causal insight from experts? We\nbelieve the need for interpretable models of behavior to guide intervention\nmakes the development of more capable causal modeling approaches key\nfor useful behavioral modeling.\nOur discussion ended with an exploration of rudimentary models and sim-\nulations of behavior at different levels of abstraction. These served as simple\nillustrations of the interplay between theory- and data-driven perspectives\non social and behavioral modeling. They also serve as a concrete canvas on\nwhich to test our growing sophistication in evaluating behavioral models and\nsimulations.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A logical\nquestion becomes: can one develop an instrument to browse this reality, a new\nmacroscope into world state? One purpose of such a device would be to reliably\nobserve physical and social phenomena at scale, as interpreted by the collective\nintelligence of social media users.\nThis chapter describes computational insights that give rise to information\nprocessing algorithms for such an instrument. Engineers have long investigated\nhow signals propagate through noisy channels. For example, engineers study\nhow AM/FM radio transmissions propagate through air, walls, and metal, how\nvibrations travel through terrain, and how acoustic waves travel through phys-\nical matter. Signal loss and distortions are introduced. Such loss and distor-\ntions change or bias the received signal. An understanding of signal emission\nand propagation properties can simultaneously help reconstruct both a good\napproximation of the original transmitted signal as well as a model of the intro-\nduced perturbation or bias. Can one apply the same wisdom to social sensing\nto reconstruct both physical reality and human biases from posts propagating\non social media?\nThe analogy between humans and physical media might at first seem too\nsuperficial if not outright offensive. After all, humans are much more intelli-\ngent, sophisticated, and unpredictable compared to physical things. They do\nnot obey strict laws of nature, they have hidden agendas, and they engage in\nbehaviors that are substantially more complex than air molecules or earth par-\nticles. In view of such drastic differences, how can one possibly borrow from\nengineering, a science geared toward the study of physical artifacts?\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

For example, in elections, the available\nchoices are vote yes, vote no, or abstain. Similarly, when propagating informa-\ntion on Twitter, the choices are retweet an existing tweet, write a new tweet,\nor stay silent. While it is hard to predict the behavior of an individual, in\naggregate, the overall proportions of different outcomes are easier to predict.\nFor example, one may predict with some accuracy whether a given gun control\nlaw will meet community approval, given a high-level classification of the\ncommunity as a whole, such as liberals vs. conservatives. The same applies to\nother behaviors, such as deciding to propagate a post that espouses a given\npolitical point of view (i.e. retweet it), or not. Predictions can be described by\nprobability distributions over the set of possible outcomes. Predictions at the\ncommunity level (e.g. results of a vote) are easier to compute than predictions\nof individual human choices.\nWe should also distinguish between the what and the why questions. The\nquestion of \u201cwhat the result of a (conservative or liberal) vote is going to be\u201d is\na much easier question to answer compared with the question of why individu-\nals will vote that way. The rationalization is usually a lot more complex, rooted\nin origins that remain subject to active research and debate, such as moral foun-\ndations theory (Graham et al. 2013) and the Schwartz value system (Schwartz\nand Bilsky 1987). Indeed some social scientists suggest that humans are prone\nto making decisions intuitively based on simple rules wired by evolution (Kah-\nneman 2011; Graham et al. 2013), then consciously rationalizing the intuitive\ndecisions, as opposed to using rational thinking to determine decision out-\ncomes in the first place (Haidt 2001). If such is indeed the case, then collective\nhuman decisions may be easier to predict than their accompanying rational-\nizations. This chapter is exclusively focused in the what question. We focus on\nalgorithms that model and exploit (the statistical distribution of ) behavior out-\ncomes as opposed to behavior reasons and rationales. We call the observable\noutcomes on the social medium the social (media) signal.\nThe above discussion leads to the core of our analogy: much in the way phys-\nical objects induce distinguishable signals in their physical environment that\ncan be detected by observing the physical medium, socially relevant events\ninduce distinguishable signals in their social environment that can be detected\nby observing the social medium. A study of the way these signals are emitted,\nthe way they travel, and the way they are perturbed by the medium can lead to\nalgorithms that help reconstruct both reality in the physical world and the per-\nturbation introduced by the medium. The analogy opens up a novel research\nfield, where human-centered sciences meet research on physical, computing,\nand engineered systems to better characterize the collective properties of social\nmedia signals, with the goal of exploiting social media to understand both phys-\nical reality and human/cultural biases.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nInterdisciplinary Foundations: Sensors, Information, and Optimal Estimation 479\nWe view the aforementioned reconstruction problem as a collaboration\nbetween humans and machines. The machine automates data preprocessing by\nobserving data (propagation) patterns on social media and using those patterns\nto convert the firehose of emitted data into a more structured representation.\nThe added structure separates descriptions of different events, separates\nreality from falsehoods, and separates text based on different source biases.\nThis structure helps humans select the specific events they are interested\nin studying, set appropriate alert triggers (when events of interest occur),\nunderstand a notion of truth (vs. falsehoods) about these events, and learn\nbiases of the different communities involved. The human should not have to\naid the machine in doing its preprocessing. The premise of the social sensing\nanalogy is that this preprocessing can be accomplished automatically by an\nappropriate signal processing algorithm much the way the signal processing\nalgorithm of an acoustic sensor array might automatically eliminate echoes,\naccount for sound reflections and other imperfections, and ultimately detect\nthe true location of a tank. It remains to be seen how far this approach can go,\nbut initial results, presented later in this chapter, suggest that there is promise.\nInterdisciplinary Foundations: Sensors, Information,\nand Optimal Estimation\nWe view individuals on social media as agents stimulated by physical world\nevents to share or relay information. These agents are imperfect. They may\nproduce reports (e.g. tweets) that are biased and may disseminate willful\nmisinformation. In doing so, they act as noisy sensors and/or noisy commu-\nnication channels. Two problems can be defined on this context, inspired\nby physical sensors. The first, referred to in engineering literature as signal\ndetection, is to reconstruct reality in the physical world from the shared reports\nby automatically detecting and correcting for misinformation and bias. The\nsecond, referred to as channel estimation, is to characterize information dis-\ntortion properties of the reporting medium (i.e. the community of individuals\ninvolved). For example, we show that one may characterize the prevalent biases\nin the community from the manner in which the community propagates or\nfilters information. In turn, such characterization may shed light on underlying\ncultural norms, political affiliations, or moral foundations. Three key concepts\nhave been developed in embedded systems to address the above two problems\nanalytically. They are described below:\nMaximum likelihood estimation: There is a circular dependency between\nsignal detection and channel estimation. Accurate signal detection needs a\nstatistical model of introduced distortion in order for effects of distortion\nto be undone. Hence, it needs results of channel estimation. Conversely,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n480 Social Media Signal Processing\nchannel estimation needs accurate measurements of the signal in order for\nthe nature of distortion to be determined. Hence, it needs results of signal\ndetection. Fortunately, prior literature developed iterative algorithms for\njoint channel estimation and signal detection, in which both problems are\nsolved simultaneously from scratch. A popular solution approach in this\ncontext is maximum likelihood estimation, which can be accomplished using\nthe expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm (Moon 1996). It proceeds by\nsolving the signal detection problem given a channel estimate, solving the\nchannel estimation problem given presently detected signals, and iterating\nuntil convergence is reached. Later in this chapter, we use EM to simultane-\nously detect misinformation on the social medium (signal detection) as well\nas estimate biases of different sources (channel estimation).\nInformation gain: Another key concept is to separate important vs. unimpor-\ntant signals. Intuitively, important signals carry more information on the\nprobability distribution of variables of interest. Information theory (Cover\nand Thomas 2012) offers a formal definition wherein the amount of infor-\nmation received is measured by the reduction in the number of bits needed\nto encode the possible values of a variable as a result of receiving the infor-\nmation on that variable. More precisely, it is measured by the reduction in\nthe shortest possible average length of lossless compression encoding of the\ndata. This reduction is formally called information gain. We shall use infor-\nmation gain in lieu of semantic notions of information to decide on impor-\ntance of signals received. To illustrate, consider an investigation into the color\nof an escape vehicle used in a recent bank robbery. Assume the color was\ninitially determined to be either black, blue, red, or green, with equal prob-\nability. Since there are four equally probable colors, conveying the actual\nvehicle color will take two bits. Now, assume that additional information\nwas received that eliminates the color red and makes blue twice as likely\nas either of the remaining two colors. Hence, the probabilities now are 50%\nfor blue, 25% for black, and 25% for green. An optimal encoder saves band-\nwidth by giving more probable values fewer bits; for example, it might denote\nblue by the code word 0, black by the code word 10, and green by the code\nword 11. The expected number of bits transmitted to convey the color is the\nweighted sum of color probabilities, each multiplied by the corresponding\ncode word length, or 0.5 \u00d7 (1 bit) + 0.25 \u00d7 (2 bits) + 0.25 \u00d7 (2 bits) = 1 bit. The\nreceived information therefore reduces the average number of bits needed to\nconvey color from 2 bits to 1 bit. The information gain is 2 \u2212 1 = 1 bit. Infor-\nmation theory offers convenient general mathematical expressions to com-\npute information gain that allow comparing different signals. For example,\nif information was received that make one outcome of a vote significantly\nmore likely, the resulting information gain can be formally quantified (as\nin the above example). In general, one can associate information gain with\nany spike or change in the probability distribution of a signal.

It describes the statistical properties of the\nmedium\u2019s reaction (or output) when exposed to a given stimulus, event, or\naction (the input). For example, when a tank moves, it produces an input\nstimulus on its environment, causing the emission of an output signal (e.g.\nsound) whose statistical properties are characteristic of the tank. From\nthe perspective of an engineer, one way to model the signal generated on\ntext-based social media, such as Twitter, is by changes in the joint probability\ndistribution of emitted words and phrases. The joint probability distribution\nof words and phrases simply refers to the probability of occurrence of their\ndifferent combinations. This distribution can be estimated empirically from\nthe observed frequency of occurrence of these combinations on the medium.\nIndividual words and phrases are indeed the fundamental building blocks\nof more complex text patterns. When events occur in the physical world,\ntheir occurrence changes the joint probability distribution of emitted words\nand phrases on the medium. We can use information gain to determine how\nmuch information (in the information-theoretic sense described above)\na given change carries, which can be used as a foundation for detecting\nimportant events. The larger the change in the joint probability distribution,\nthe higher the information gain.\nBelow, we describe how the above analytical insights can be used to solve\nthe intertwined problems of signal detection and channel estimation on social\nmedia.\nEvent Detection and Demultiplexing on the Social\nChannel\nEvent detection refers to recognizing that a particular event has occurred.\nEvent demultiplexing is the act of separating signals attributed to different\nevents. Before we discuss event detection and demultiplexing on social media,\nit is important to define the input stimulus more precisely. The input stimulus\nis the event that causes reaction on the medium. It is the event we want\nto detect. For the purposes of this chapter, an event refers to an incident\nthat (i) occupies continuous limited time and space and (ii) is observable by\nhumans. Examples include individual demonstrations, flash-crowd events, car\naccidents, tornadoes, explosions, or parades. Let us consider a Twitter-based\nexample. Consider the task of detecting the occurrence of tornadoes in the\nUnited States from their signature on Twitter. A simple approach might be\nto cut time into windows and inspect the received tweets for the number ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The resulting probability\ndistributions are compared across successive windows. A distribution change\nthat has a high information gain can then be indicative of tornado-related\nevent, such a tornado warning or a tornado sighting.\nThis basic approach needs to be extended to demultiplexing. On Twitter, sig-\nnal demultiplexing is simply the challenge of separating tweets pertaining to\none event from those pertaining to another. For example, we want to separate\nthe tweets about one tornado from the tweets about another concurrent tor-\nnado. A key question is: can we do such separation automatically by a machine\nthat does not understand the language? Interestingly, not only is the answer\nin the affirmative, but also the event separation algorithm turns out to be very\nsimple, if proper intuitions are exploited.\nWhen signals are represented in a sufficiently sparse feature space, different\nsources give rise to unique signal features (e.g. sets of signal spikes unique to\neach source) that allow one to distinguish among the sources. As mentioned\nearlier, on Twitter, we consider a lexical feature space, where words and phrases\nare the observed features. Events change the joint probability distribution of\ncombinations of words and phrases (that are related to those events) on the\nmedium. By the principle of Occam\u2019s razor, let us consider the simplest such\ncombinations first, namely, combinations of two words. The lexicon of com-\nmonly used words in a language, such as English, may contain around 10 000\nwords. There are 100 million possible combinations of two words (i.e. work\npairs). This is several orders of magnitude larger than the number of event\ninstances we might need to distinguish (demultiplex) at any given time. Hence,\nevents in the feature space of word combinations are indeed sparse. The prob-\nability of overlap between the frequent word pairs used in describing different\nevents is very small. Note that common phrases such as Bay Bridge or New\nYork are treated as a single word or token for the purposes of this discussion.\nTo detect new events today, one merely needs to look for new frequent combi-\nnations that were not prevalent on the medium yesterday.\nTo illustrate, consider tracking car accidents. A particular car accident\ninvolving a drunk truck driver killing a dog on a bridge might be described\nby tweets containing such words as drunk, dog, and bridge, leading to a spike\nin the co-occurrence of new pairs of words such as drunk and dog in tweets\ndescribing the event. These words do not normally co-occur. A spike in their\njoint frequency of use in today\u2019s tweets indicates the occurrence of a new event.\nA question becomes: how do we know what pattern of new event-specific\nco-occurring words to look for in order to detect a new event instance?\nThe answer is: we do not have to know it ahead of time. We simply use\ninformation gain. More precisely, we cut time into windows and count all com-\nbinations of two words in the tweets emitted in each window. Hence, a tweet\nof 10 words, for example, would contain (10 \u00d7 9)/2 = 45 different two-word\ncombinations. We then identify those pairs that occur disproportionatelyDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The information gain metric, discussed earlier, offers a statistically\nwell-founded measure of significance of frequency deviations of a word pair\nfrom the norm. High information gain word pairs are identified in the current\nwindow of observation. Each is then associated with a separate bin of tweets.\nTweets containing both of the words of an identified high information gain\nword pair (in any order) are placed in the corresponding bin. Bins with largely\nsimilar tweets are then consolidated into one. The result is that tweets on\nthe most informative events (i.e. events that resulted in high information\ngain changes in the joint word probability distribution on the medium) are\ncollected into corresponding bins. They are automatically separated into a\nsingle bin per event, which constitutes demultiplexing.\nTable 20.1 shows examples of tweets about different detected protests after\ndemultiplexing. In this example, tweets were collected that contain the word\nprotest. The stream of collected tweets was then automatically separated into\nbins using the technique described above. In the table, tweets on three differ-\nent detected protests are shown that occurred around 26 December 2017. The\nhigh information gain automatically detected word pair corresponding to each\nbin is also shown. It can be seen that the automatic separation of tweets by the\nprotest they describe is accurate despite the fact that the text uses slang, broken\nEnglish, and ad hoc abbreviations. Indeed, the power of the signal processing\napproach, described in this chapter, lies in that the machine never interprets\nthe text. It does not need to know proper vocabulary, slang, or specific abbre-\nviations. It simply counts co-occurrences of word combinations in tweets with\nno interpretation of what the words represent. No prior training or labeling\nis needed. The significance of this approach for distinguishing different event\ninstances lies in eliminating the human effort for machine training and label-\ning. The approach applies regardless of the language used (because it does not\nneed to understand it) and is thus insensitive to slang, abbreviations, grammati-\ncal errors, and other imperfections that may pose problems for approaches that\nknow something about vocabulary or grammar. (The latter approaches are usu-\nally sensitive to the language, dialect, and spelling that they were trained with.)\nThe technique presented above is valuable as a preprocessing step to impose\nstructure on data by separating it into different event bins.\nThe wealth of information posted on social media offers promise as a\nmechanism for understanding human behavior. The event detection and\ndemultiplexing approach described in this section allows the human infor-\nmation processing effort to be reduced. For example, it becomes easier to\nautomatically filter out less important events, generate alerts when important\nevents occur, or focus exclusively on particular event instances, without\nmanually going through all tweets to distinguish ones that belong to those\nspecific instances. We are therefore hopeful that solutions, such as the above,\ncan empower and accelerate social science research.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Our social medium\ncomprises imperfect human observers who act as information sources and\nrelays. How well does the collective output of those observers represent\nreality in the physical world? The reception of more reports about an alleged\noccurrence of some event does not necessarily lend more credibility to that\nevent. Some sources may simply repeat information they heard from others\nwithout independent verification. Similarly, internal bias of sources makes\nthem predisposed to believing information that confirms their bias and\nrelaying it without questioning. Hence, misinformation may be propagated,\nleading to highly correlated widely spread beliefs that misrepresent reality.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For example, the claim that a bomb was detonated on Main\nStreet in a given city at a given time can be factually verified to be either true\nor false. Opinions, in contrast, are not easily verifiable via direct observation.\nFor example, whether a particular leader is good or bad is usually a matter of\nopinion. The opinion may depend on an individual\u2019s value system, loyalties,\nand rationale. Let us first consider factual statements only. Later we shall\nextend the discussion to consider opinions.\nSocial media posts cast as factual statements constitute misinformation if\nthey contradict ground truth. One question to consider is: can we automatically\ndetect and flag misinformation on the social medium? Clearly, if the reliabil-\nity of each source on the social medium is known, the problem of detecting\nmisinformation will be much simpler. Unfortunately, source reliability is gen-\nerally unknown. Hence, we jointly compute the truth value of each reported\nstatement (which is a signal detection problem), together with computing the\nreliability of each source (which is a channel estimation problem) using algo-\nrithms for joint signal detection and channel estimation.\nConceptually, we represent the reported observations (tweets) about an event\nby a graph of sources and claims that we call the source\u2013claim network. Sources\nsimply refer to the IDs of devices that report the corresponding data. Claims can\nbe thought of as abstract statements reported by the sources. In this case, we\ntake the tweets as claims. In the resulting source\u2013claim network, a link between\na source and a claim indicates that the source asserted that claim (i.e. made that\ntweet). Hence, when multiple individuals make the same claim (e.g. retweet the\nsame statement), they are connected to the same claim node in the graph. Sim-\nilarly, all claims made by the same individual are connected to the same source\nnode. The source\u2013claim network is a general representation of reported data\nthat enables cleaning. Another data structure is the empirically observed cor-\nrelations among different pairs of sources (measured by the percentage of time\nthe pair makes the same claim). These are used to estimate probability of cor-\nrelated errors. Once the source\u2013claim graph and the source correlation graph\nare formed, the joint channel estimation and signal detection problem can be\nsolved. Recent literature reported different ways to jointly estimate source reli-\nability parameters, together with the true/false value of each claim, using the\nsource\u2013claim graph, SC, and source correlation graph, SD, as input (Wang et al.\n2014; Yao et al. 2016). These techniques require no prior labeling of data; no\none needs to tell the machine what reality is or tag any tweets as true or false.\nResults show that the algorithms automatically determine the truth values of\ntweets with up to 80\u201390% accuracy with no prior training or labeling.\nThe idea behind these techniques is depicted in Figure 20.1, where circu-\nlar nodes represent sources and square nodes represent claims.

The likelihood function is also depicted as a conditional\nprobability of observing the graph, SC. Hence, for example, a square on the\nright with many incoming edges represents a tweet repeated by many sources.\nA pair of circles on the left that are connected represents a pair of correlated\nsources, perhaps one that follows the other on Twitter. Intuitively, a claim made\nby a larger number of more independent (i.e. not connected) sources is more\nlikely to be true. Similarly, a source who makes more claims that are deemed\ntrue is likely to be more reliable. The observation suggests an approach where\nsource reliability and claim correctness can be jointly determined in an itera-\ntive fashion with no prior knowledge of ground truth and no prior reputation\nscores.\nInformally, the estimation algorithm randomly initializes reliability param-\neters for each source and truth/falsehood values for each claim. An iterative\napproach is used to adjust source reliability parameters and claim correctness\nvalues in a direction that maximizes the likelihood. The iterations are derived\nby applying a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm, called EM. It con-\nverges to a maximum likelihood estimate, which in this case yields the most\nlikely source reliability values and the most likely true/false classification for\neach tweet. Moreover, variance of the resulting estimator could be obtained\nusing the Cramer\u2013Rao bound (Cramer 1946). In turn, this variance allows com-\nputing a confidence interval in results, which separates the aforementioned\napproach from prior work on media exploitation and fact-finding.

The algorithm augments work described earlier\non event detection and demultiplexing by a capability to assess veracity of indi-\nvidual claims (tweets) made about the events in question.\nHuman Bias, Opinions, and Polarization\nDetecting misinformation, as described in the previous section, is useful when\nthe social medium is leveraged as a sensing instrument of physical reality.\nEqually important, however, is the use of the social medium to understand\nhuman opinions and beliefs. Following our signal processing approach, we\nwould like to infer beliefs from the way signals propagate on the medium,\nmuch in the way propagation of acoustic waves can be used to infer properties\nof terrain in which the waves propagate (e.g. map the ocean floor).\nModeling Signal Propagation\nLet us first understand the impact of trust relations among sources and the\nimpact of source bias on information propagation. Toward that end, we con-\nducted an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk, where individuals were\nasked whether they would relay and whether they would contradict each of\nmultiple statements describing different experiences. Three treatments were\nconsidered, depending on whether the experiences in question were (i) pre-\nsented as witnessed firsthand by the individual, (ii) reported to the individual\nby a source they consider reliable, or (iii) reported by an unreliable source.\nTable 20.2 presents the statements that the participants were presented with.\nOne should add the caveat that what participants claimed they would do is not\nnecessarily the same as what they would do in reality. Nevertheless, as we show\nlater, results inspired effective bias separation algorithms.\nObserve in particular that statements 6\u201310 described a conflict between two\nimagined families in the imagined city of the participant (which was named\nZalawera). Each of the three treatments mentioned above was thus further\ndivided into two groups. In one, participants were told that they were a member\nof one of the families (the Clays). In the other, participants were not given a fam-\nily affiliation. The purpose was to measure the impact of bias (to protect family\nname) on choices made by the participants in relaying or denying information.\nThe experiment included 759 participants (limited for logistical reasons to\nthe US citizens). All participants included in the study were 18 years of age\nor older, with over 50% of participants\u2019 ages ranging between 18 and 34 years\nof age. Sex was represented equally within the sample (50% female and 50%\nmale).

First, the study found a statistically sig-\nnificant dependence between predisposition to relay information and the level\nof trust in source. Specifically, groups who were told that they witnessed the\nstated events firsthand were more likely to relay the statements than those who\nwere told that they received the information from another source they trust.\nSimilarly, the latter groups were more likely to relay information than those who\nwere told they received the information from a source not known for reliability.\nSecond, among groups who were given the Clays affiliation, there was a statis-\ntically significant correlation between predisposition to contradict the informa-\ntion and the degree of damage the information posed to the Clay name. More\nspecifically, looking at questions 6\u201310, it is easy to see that they are sorted from\nmost damaging to Clays to most empathetic with Clays.

These results offer evidence that in-group bias produces an informa-\ntion filtering effect, whereby groups are less likely to relay (and more likely to\ncontradict) information that conflicts with their bias. In contrast, in contexts\ninvolving no conflicts, no such filtering effect exists.\nWhile the above study was limited to the US participants, it would be inter-\nesting to compare the results for different cultures and backgrounds. Empirical\nevidence suggests that the collective filtering introduced by conflicted groups\ncreates a valuable means to infer their respective biases, as explained below.\nOpinion Separation and Polarization Detection\nThe informal intuition is that individuals will propagate information they agree\nwith. Let us draw a graph where individuals are nodes and where the thickness\nof an edge between two nodes represents how many times they agreed on the\nsame post (e.g. tweeted/retweeted the same thing). The more frequently they\nagree, the thicker the edge. Now, let us grow clusters of nodes by merging nodes\nconnected by thick edges into the same cluster. The output of such clustering\nis a partitioning of the community by opinions shared by different subgroups.\nRecent empirical work has shown that such partitioning is especially effective at\nseparating supporters of different sides of a debate as well as their opinions (Al\nAmin et al. 2017). For example, consider the US political system. Republicans\nwill more often propagate content that is favorable to Republicans, whereas\nDemocrats will more often propagate content that is favorable to Democrats.\nHence, thicker edges will exist among Democrats as well as among Republican,\nwhile thinner edges will exist across the two groups. The clustering algorithm\nwill therefore result in two big clusters of nodes: one of a Democrat disposition\nand the other of a Republican one. The clusters reveal who belongs to each\ngroup as well as what opinions (posts) they espouse.\nTable 20.3 illustrates the result of applying this process to the separation of\nsupporting and opposing claims tweeted after the controversial removal of the\nformer Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, from power. Pro-Morsi tweets\nare shown in the left column, whereas anti-Morsi tweets in the right. The table\nshows that the separation is very accurate despite the fact that the machine\ndoes not understand the text. Indeed, the left column depicts Morsi and his\nsupporters as victims, whereas the right column depicts Morsi and his support-\ners/party (the Muslim Brotherhood) as victimizers. The two sides are separated\nbased on text propagation patterns. In a polarized scenario, claims would gen-\nerally propagate along one of two major pathways, depending on which group\nthey are favorable to, making separation possible.\nObserve that separating supporting and opposing claims is different from\nsentiment analysis. For example, the fourth claim under the pro column in\nTable 20.3 has a strong negative sentiment (mentioning arrests, beatings, and\ndenial of rights). Yet, the claim is clearly pro-Morsi.

An interface\noffers user access to distilled information after processing.\nIn the Apollo Social Sensing Toolkit, a data collection and analytic pipeline\nis called a task. A task can be started by the user to collect data on a particu-\nlar topic. Once the relevant topic information is entered, users are presented\nwith options that allow them to choose different processing modules to run on\nthe collected data, such as veracity analysis and event detection. Experiences\nwith Apollo suggest that it often detects new events before they are reported by\nthe mainstream news media. While some events are reported by news media\nfirst, before they are relayed on social networks (e.g. statements by political\nfigures and exclusive interviews with celebrities), others appear on social net-\nworks before they are picked up by news media. Examples include reports of\ntraffic accidents, demonstrations, terrorist acts, or damage from natural dis-\nasters. More on the Apollo tool can be found in the authors\u2019 prior work (Roy\net al. 2017). An in-depth dive into the analytical foundations of the approach\ncan be found in the author\u2019s recent book (Wang et al. 2015). At the time of\nwriting, techniques described in this chapter have been used by researchers on\na daily basis to monitor protests, natural disasters, civil unrest events, acts of\nterror, social movements, and other natural and man-made phenomena around\nthe globe.\nThe approaches discussed in this chapter differ from what is traditionally\nreferred to as machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Typi-\ncal machine learning/AI solutions need labeled data in order to learn how to\nclassify inputs by categories of interest. This need is a source of great power\nas well as great pain. Clearly, exposure to large amounts of labeled data leads\nto improved solution accuracy. On the disadvantage side, the labeling effort\nis often prohibitive. For example, Project Maven (Cukor 2018) operationalizes\nmachine learning in military contexts by using deep learning for image recogni-\ntion. The most expensive component of the project lies in the labeling effort to\ntrain the machine. This training is domain sensitive. Indeed, despite the avail-\nability of large amounts of labeled training imagery on public media, Maven has\nto do its own labeling because public media images differ from military images.\nThe algorithms need labeled data from the right domain. In contrast, the solu-\ntions described above do not require machine training. No labeled data are\nused. These solutions, therefore, generalize easily across domains, languages,\ntopics, and dialects. Current efforts are focused on improving resilience with\nrespect to subversive behavior, collusion, and other efforts targeted at misdi-\nrecting these algorithms. Preliminary work suggests that low-cost collusion\ndetection techniques are possible, based on correlation analysis across sources,\ncombined with anomaly detection. In general, detecting bad online actors is an\narms race. Techniques will continue to evolve as attacks as well as defenses\nincrease in sophistication over time. Discussion of such techniques, however,\nis beyond scope for the current chapter.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The analogy demonstrates the feasibility of\nbuilding signal processing libraries for social network data analysis that are\nfounded in techniques, borrowed from the engineering discipline, such as\ninformation-theoretic signal detection and estimation-theoretic EM. The work\ncalls for a novel research agenda on developing robust data fusion algorithms\nand theory for social sensing, not unlike those for acoustic, magnetic, or\noptical sensing, based on estimation-theoretic and information-theoretic\nconcepts. These algorithms and theory may accelerate social science research\nby automating the preprocessing of large social media data sets for scientists\nby adding structure to data toward a better understanding of physical and\nsocial phenomena via the lens of social media data.\nAcknowledgment\nResearch reported in this chapter was sponsored in part by the Army\nResearch Laboratory under Cooperative Agreements W911NF-09-2-0053 and\nW911NF-17-2-0196 and in part by DARPA under award W911NF-17-C-0099.\nThe views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors\nand should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either\nexpressed or implied, of the Army Research Laboratory, DARPA, or the US\ngovernment.

For this reason,\ncomplex behavior models may be used to draw together what we know and\nbelieve about humans and to help us model and predict events in the real world.\nFor example, we may like to know the effect of a public health intervention on\ndiabetes rates (Jones et al. 2006), forecast human migration during a refugee\ncrisis (Edwards 2008), or understand how online content becomes viral (Hodas\nand Lerman 2014). As we advance the science of modeling and simulation of\ncomplex social systems, we are challenged to grapple with complexity at mul-\ntiple levels of the system. Individual decision-making behaviors can be mod-\neled, with complexity of behavior emerging from basic cognitive mechanisms.\nThe interpersonal interactions between individuals then give rise to the com-\nplex, dynamic behaviors of social systems. It follows that the development of\nnew techniques for modeling social systems requires careful consideration and\npotential advances in the methods for verification, validation, and accredita-\ntion of those models to both inform the model development process and to\ndetermine usability for desired applications.\nThis paper is written to explore validation issues in computational social\nscience research that is primarily data-driven with massive amounts of\nautomatically collected data, such as data from social media.

Additionally, we seek to\nunderstand the interplay of the online and offline social landscape reflected in\nsocial-behavioral data. To do this, we must have validated models producing\ntrustworthy simulated data to explore the phenomena of interest. Thus, this\nchapter focuses on how we can best evaluate and validate models in this chal-\nlenging problem space. Our perspective emphasizes data-driven evaluation,\nmeaning we will explore how modeling of patterns of observed data can inform\nthe larger process, and we emphasize the validation challenges in this space.\nIn what follows, we explore current practices in validation of models of social\nbehavior and challenges in performing this validation. We suggest best prac-\ntices in validation given the growing opportunities that large-scale, online social\ndata sets provide.\nAll system models involve inevitable assumptions and simplifications. To\nquote George Box, \u201call models are wrong but some are useful\u201d (Box 1979). How\ncan we be confident that a model is valid enough to capture phenomena of\ninterest? One facet of confidence is finding consistent patterns when compar-\ning the outputs of the models with the corresponding empirical observations.\nWe focus on this element throughout the current chapter. Elsewhere in this\nvolume, Davis and O\u2019Mahoney (2019) discussed six dimensions for evaluating\nmodel validity, and Carley (2019) discusses some of the major challenges to\nvalidation.\nAs simple as this sounds, execution of this validation involves many chal-\nlenges. First, to determine how well a model captures phenomena of inter-\nest, validation can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative components.\nQualitative evaluation by subject matter experts (SMEs) is a common approach\nfor model evaluation and may provide insight into a model\u2019s basic trends. In\nthis case, it is imperative that the SMEs developing the model not be those\nevaluating it, and common standards should be established a priori for con-\nsistent SME evaluation. This can be fraught with subjective judgment pitfalls\n(Young 2003; Campbell and Bolton 2005). If two models both show the same\nqualitative trends, the use of quantitative comparison may provide a way to\ndistinguish the two. Quantitative metrics also provide a mechanism for incor-\nporating machine learning or other automated model tuning and calibration\ntechniques and provide a means to determine if a model\u2019s performance evolves\nover time. Quantitative metrics indicating the ways in which a model differs\nfrom empirical observations are critical for determining how a model should\nbe improved.\nA second challenge is that we may not always have a way to articulate the\nprecise metric we seek to optimize. As Alfred Korzybski stated, \u201cthe map is\nnot the territory\u201d (Korzybski 1958). For example, the discrepancy between pre-\ndicted unemployment vs. actual unemployment may be a clear, quantitativeDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Do we say our model of social media is correct if we precisely capture\nthe temporal correlation of user posts? What metric or metrics do we choose\nif we want to validate a model of public response to building a hospital? When\nworking with complex systems like social systems, we will often need multi-\nple metrics to capture the multifaceted behaviors. How should we weigh the\nimportance of each metric to the overall effort?\nFinally, we may not possess the data necessary to compare important model\npredictions with our observations in a robust manner. A presidential election\nin the United States occurs every four years, and systematic polling has only\nbeen present for a fraction of past elections. Some models require data that\nmay not be directly observable (latent factors), such as an individual\u2019s political\npreference, so we might turn to rough proxies such as the individual\u2019s registered\nparty. Lastly, we may only have data aggregated at a resolution too coarse or too\nfine for our models, such as election outcome per state instead of per zip code\nor per neighborhood block.\nBefore delving into validation practices, we specify some terminology. In the\npresent work, theory refers to a conceptual explanation of some phenomena\nof interest; it supports conceptual explanation and exploration of those phe-\nnomena. A model is a formal instantiation of a theory, usually mathematical or\ncomputational in nature. A theory, therefore, could have multiple models if dif-\nferent approaches are used to develop the formal instantiations. A simulation\nis at least one experiment conducted with a model, in which code executes or\ncalculations are completed. It produces behaviors consistent with the theoret-\nical perspective and model instantiation. This data can then be compared with\nreal-world observations as a test or realization of the model or the theory.\nOnline Communication in Particular: A Valuable Venue for Validation\nAll of the factors described above make model validation challenging. Enter\nsocial media. Online social platforms, such as Twitter, GitHub, or Reddit, pro-\nvide a public forum for millions of people to exchange information. They pro-\nvide an unprecedented volume of data. As of 2017, Facebook had approximately\n2 billion active monthly users.1 While social media activity takes place on a\ncomputer or phone, it is also very much the real world. People meet, form\ngroups, exchange knowledge, create friendships, etc. These large-scale data sets\nprovide a unique opportunity in social-behavioral modeling to explore a full\nrange of validation metrics on a wide variety of human actions, addressing\nmany of the above concerns.\nUsing social media as a window into social behavior, we can see how different\nmodeling approaches might influence different evaluation metrics.

Therefore, modeling approaches necessarily drive eval-\nuation metrics. Social media, with millions of users and perhaps billions of\nevents, provides a venue for exploring and validating both microscopic and\nmacroscopic models of social behaviors.\nSimulation Validation\nValidation for modeling and simulation is the process of determining the extent\nto which the behavior produced by the model is an accurate representation\nof the real-world phenomena it attempts to reproduce (Roache 2009; Sargent\n2011; U.S. Department of Defense 2011). Validation allows for conclusions to\nbe drawn about the utility of the simulation for its intended use. We note that\nvalidation methods are often discussed together with verification and accredi-\ntation processes, and it is important to distinguish these processes. Verification\nis the process of evaluating the modeling and simulation implementation; that\nis, it addresses whether the model and its associated data are implemented\naccurately, reflecting the developer\u2019s concept and specifications (Roache 2009;\nU.S. Department of Defense 2011). This is the process whereby software bugs\nare found, errors in equations or logic are corrected, etc. Accreditation is a\nformal certification process that must be accomplished before a model can be\ndeployed into operations (U.S. Department of Defense 2011). This typically\noccurs for mature models that have been vetted through verification and\nvalidation already. In the present chapter, we emphasize only the validation\nprocess, because this is the critical process by which the social science\nresearch community will compare and contrast models, seeking to advance the\nresearch field.\nModel validity can be broken down into concept validity, or the adequacy\nof the underlying conceptual or theoretical model in characterizing the\nreal world, and operational validity, or the adequacy and accuracy of the\ncomputational model in matching real-world data (Sargent 2011). Addi-\ntionally, application validity captures the degree to which a model is valid\nfor its intended use (Campbell and Bolton 2005). There are many possible\ntechniques for probing a model\u2019s validity. Face validity is evaluated by SMEs\njudging the reasonableness of the simulation outputs. Turing tests also entail\nSME evaluation, as experts attempt to distinguish simulation from reality.\nQuantitative approaches include graphical comparisons between simulation\nand observation and numerical quantification (e.g. goodness-of-fit statistics)\nof the difference between the model predictions and ground truth.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nSimulation Evaluation: Current Practices 499\nCompared with validation of simulations in the physical sciences and\nengineering, validation of simulations of social behavior both online and\noffline has relied extensively on face validity and qualitative comparisons.\nThat is, the emphasis has been on expert judgment that a model is parsi-\nmonious with the expectation for how the system should work. This can be\nexplained by the unique data collection challenges in the social sciences,\nincluding systems that cannot be observed directly and systems with many\ninterdependencies that cannot be measured simultaneously. And although the\nvalidation needs in social science simulation are in many ways similar to other\nfields, a key difference is particularly evident when considering online social\nsystems: model development and validation are concurrent with the efforts to\ndefine and understand the very phenomena to be modeled. Older fields, like\nphysics, engineering, and behavior representation modeling, benefited from\nyears of empirical work in which models were developed and evaluated for\nconstruct validity prior to computational simulation research (Campbell and\nBolton 2005). The consequence is that social simulation work must validate\nthe theoretical constructs together with modeling and simulation approaches\nand it must incorporate the ability to adapt all these tools with our changing\nunderstanding of social behavior and emerging phenomena in evolving social\nenvironments. However, as novel data sources have increased the available\nvolume and variety of ground truth observations of social behaviors, we are\nincreasingly able to leverage the quantitative techniques developed in other\nfields to both aid the characterization of the data and evaluation of models. In\nthis chapter, we focus on the application of quantitative operational validity\nfor comparative validation of social and behavioral models.\nSimulation Evaluation: Current Practices\nTo explore common practices in current social science modeling and simula-\ntion validation efforts, we examine the methods in recent use for simulation of\ninformation diffusion in online systems. Modeling of information propagation\nin social networks and other online ecosystems has typically focused on a\ndescriptive approach to diffusion phenomena. For example, some (e.g. Kwak\net al. 2010) study the network properties of Twitter and the temporal diffusion\nproperties of trending topics. Others (e.g. Ferrara and Yang 2015) study how\nsentiment affects information diffusion on Twitter, and yet others (e.g. Adamic\net al. 2016) study how memes evolve during a diffusion cascade on Facebook.\nSuch descriptive studies provide key insights for properties of information\ndiffusion that should be replicated by simulations and models of these\nphenomena.\nValidation of the simulation of information diffusion through online social\nsystems is typically performed either through qualitative evaluation ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This quantitative comparison\ncan be performed on properties of the full diffusion path of a message or on\nthe propagation of messages through specific nodes in the social network.\nExamples of qualitative evaluation of simulation results include the visual com-\nparison of the cumulative distribution of the total size, depth, and structural\nvirality of cascades through online social networks (Del Vicario et al. 2016;\nGoel et al. 2016).\nSome examples of metrics that quantitatively evaluate the full diffusion pro-\ncess of a message include the root-mean-square error (RMSE), relative error,\nor mean error of the total number of message shares (de C Gatti et al. 2013;\nJin et al. 2013), the absolute difference in number of users of who agree or dis-\nagree with a particular message (Serrano and Iglesias 2016), and the relative\nabsolute error of the proportion of users within a certain graph distance that\nreceive the message (Wang et al. 2012).\nApproaches that focus more on quantitative node-level evaluation include\npredictive metrics such as the use of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of\nwhether individual users will propagate a message and the mean square error\n(MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the predicted rate at which they will\ndo so (Galuba et al. 2010; Gomez Rodriguez et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Hu\net al. 2017).\nMost existing approaches focus on model fit statistics rather than performing\ncross-validation, which limits validation to studying only how well a model fits\na particular sample of data. Cross-validation using a held-out data set is desir-\nable because it evaluates the ability of the model to predict or generalize across\ndata sets (Pew et al. 2005). Validation is sometimes performed on a metric other\nthan the optimization criteria used for the model fitting, which can add an addi-\ntional dimension for model performance evaluation and comparison. The use\nof separate train and test sets is more common for approaches that leverage\npredictive metrics, with some approaches using a time-based train\u2013test split\n(Galuba et al. 2010) and others splitting on users (Hu et al. 2017).\nMeasurements, Metrics, and Their Limitations\nWhen evaluating simulation results, the goal should be to replicate the behav-\niors and phenomena found in the observed ground truth data. Ground truth\ndata is a sample of real-world data containing the phenomena of interest; data\nselection or design is driven by the questions of interest for the modeling and\nsimulation activities. In any complex social system, there will be a multitude\nof simultaneously occurring phenomena observed in the same set of social\ninteractions. Measurements are designed to directly probe these properties\nin the data. For example, in the simulation of online information diffusion,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nMeasurements, Metrics, and Their Limitations 501\nmeasurements used in previous work have included the total volume of\nthe diffusion cascades (Jin et al. 2013), the transmission rate of a particular\nnetwork edge (Wang et al. 2014), and the number of shares as a function of\ntime (Matsubara et al. 2012).\nGiven a set of such measurements, one must then evaluate how well the\nmeasured behavior corresponds with observations. For this purpose, metrics\nallow you to compare the results of modeling or simulation with ground truth\nthrough quantitative comparison of their observed measurements. A large\nrange of possible metrics are available; choices depend on the scaling proper-\nties of the measurements being compared and the goals of the comparisons.\nMetrics could include distribution comparisons such as Kullback\u2013Leibler\ndivergence, ranked list comparisons such as Spearman correlation, and\nsequence comparisons such as Levenshtein distance.\nMost existing approaches for modeling online social behavior in social net-\nworks rely on a limited set of measurements, usually focused on a specific phe-\nnomenon (e.g. information cascades or gatekeepers), a specific problem (e.g.\npredicting meme propagation), or a specific social media platform (e.g. Twit-\nter or Instagram). In current practice, model evaluation depends on the specific\nmodeling approach, with different approaches being used for machine learning\nvs. epidemiological models.\nMoreover, current evaluation approaches suffer from difficulty with properly\nmeasuring causal relationships in the data, sensitivity of the existing mea-\nsurements to initial conditions and model assumptions, and failure to account\nfor uncertainty. Additionally, comparison among simulation and model\napproaches is inhibited by the lack of common computational environments,\ncommon input/output formats for data, and common measurements and\nmetrics. The impact of this is a challenge for generalizability to new contexts,\ninability to reproduce the validation approach for new models, and difficulties\nin interpretation of validation results.\nLack of Common Standards\nPrevious social simulation efforts have applied a variety of validation strate-\ngies and metrics. However, because each effort applied different validation\ntechniques, comparison of the results among the approaches is not feasible.\nAt a high level, simulation approaches can be thought of as differing along the\ngranularity of simulation, while at a deeper level the approaches could differ\nin the nature of the techniques employed. For example, the approaches could\nbe simulating individual, group-level, or population-level dynamics, while\ntwo individual-level approaches could differ in the nature of the agent models\nused. Granularity may also vary along dimensions like time or geospatial\nresolution (e.g. municipality vs. nation), which can affect the patterns observed\nin individual-, group-, or population-level approaches.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n502 Evaluation and Validation Approaches for Simulation of Social Behavior\nCommon data sets and challenge problems can play a critical role in model\ncomparison and validation. Understanding which approaches capture the\nobserved behavior and phenomena at a specific resolution with greater fidelity\nwould allow better understanding of the relative success of each approach.\nHowever, because the choices of measurements and metrics are often limited\nby the chosen modeling approach, it can be challenging to select a common\nset of validation techniques to apply broadly.\nLet us assume that our test panel consists of three simulation approaches. S1\nis a population-level system dynamics simulator, and S2 and S3 are two agent-\nbased approaches. S2 consists of agents modeled via statistical distributions and\nS3 via cognitive models. Testing against only the population-level time-series\nmeasurements diminishes the ability to see the value of the finer-resolution\nmodels S2 and S3 . Testing against only the individual traces means that S1 is\nbound to fail because the levels of relevant dynamics are mismatched. Nonethe-\nless, testing against the individual traces is needed to reveal the parallels and\ndiscrepancies between the S2 and S3 .\nSelection of Appropriate Measurements and Metrics\nEven when the stated goal of a simulation or modeling effort is relatively\nstraightforward, such as predicting the proportion of a population that will\nadopt a certain behavior after a public health campaign, selecting appropriate\nmeasurements and metrics to compare the agreement between the model and\nobservations is not always clear-cut. For example, should the proportion of\nadoption be measured as a function of time or only after a fixed period? Should\nthe metrics measure relative or absolute error? Does the model performance\nvary across different types of campaigns, different communities within the\npopulation, or different volumes of campaign outreach? In the case of more\ncomplex simulation scenarios, such as sandbox simulations used for explo-\nration and hypothesis testing, the selection of appropriate validation criteria\nbecomes even more of a challenge. In such complex scenarios, validation may\nbe less about success or failure of a model, but instead about defining a set of\nmetrics that elaborate on the multivariate nature of the modeling results to\nunderstand the ways the model did or did not capture aspects of the scenarios\nunder study.\nAdditionally, when employing measurements and metrics for cross-model\ncomparison and validation, the selection of metrics that can appropriately\ndistinguish the relative performance of the models is crucial. For example,\nchoosing metrics on which all models fail completely or perform perfectly\ndoes not provide the ability to make a useful comparison. Nor would such\napproaches be informative about how to improve the models or the validation\nprocess. Indeed, as Pew et al. (2005) suggested, when complexity of the\nmodeling increases, we are in danger of learning less about human behaviorDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We can carefully avoid this by emphasizing\nmodel comparison through a broad set of relevant validation metrics.\nCorrelations, Causation, and Transfer Entropy\nWhile a lot of big data analyses revolve around finding meaningful correla-\ntions, when we are dealing with social data sets, it is much more useful to find\nevidence of causality. This is because causal influence can produce very inter-\nesting phenomena such as cascades and viral spreading of behaviors. Therefore,\nit becomes important to develop evaluation criteria that can probe the causal\nrelationships present in the observed social phenomena. Understanding causal-\nity between observed entities, and differentiating direct causality from latent\nfactors, allows us to determine whether the simulation models the causal rela-\ntionships. If it does, we can be more confident that the model will replicate the\nempirically observed effects of causal relationships.\nDistinguishing causality (influence) from other confounding factors such as\nhomophily in social settings is an extremely hard problem as discussed in Shal-\nizi and Thomas (2011) and Anagnostopoulos et al. (2008). Anagnostopoulos\net al. (2008) also pointed out that statistical tests can be designed to identify\nthe presence of influence when the time series of users\u2019 actions are available\nsuch as in the case of online social media. Influence patterns between time\nseries of entities can help characterize significant social phenomena. Therefore\nsuch analysis needs to be part of the evaluation strategy, particularly to help\nidentify if the measured influence is causal or the by-product of another latent\nfactor or phenomenon. Potential analyses seeking insights into this question\ninclude measures of synchrony between two entities, such as cross-correlation,\ncross-spectral coherence, cross-recurrence quantification analysis, or average\nmutual information. We note that most of these analyses rely on finding\npatterns within a single level of granularity in the data by comparing time\nseries. This can be useful for comparing data from two simulations, two sets of\nreal-world data, and between real-world data and simulated data.\nOne specific, useful model-free statistic for measuring causal influence (or\ninformation transfer) is transfer entropy (TE) introduced by Schreiber (2000).\nTE is rooted in information-theoretic analyses of source and target time-series\ndata and does not assume any interaction models (Vicente et al. 2011). TE has\nacquired increasing popularity in the measurement of influence between time\nseries corresponding to social media entities (Ver Steeg and Galstyan 2012;\nBorge-Holthoefer et al. 2016). TE, however, comes with its own set of issues.\nWhile a model-free measure, TE still needs some parameters to be fixed for\ncomputation. This process is nontrivial. The statistical significance of TE is\nalso difficult to quantify. It is challenging to form an intuitive understanding\nof the strength of the causal influence given a certain numeric value for TE.\nFinally, spuriously high TE values can occur when two processes X and YDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Without the knowledge of the under-\nlying cause Z, it appears that the leading process (X) is influencing the\nlagging (Y ) even though the same is not true. Thus, careful analysis of possible\nrelationships between factors and probing for missing knowledge is needed.\nInitial Conditions and Model Assumptions\nEvaluation of modeling and simulation must be done in context. Context, in\nthis case, encompasses articulation of (i) the problem under study, (ii) the the-\noretical framework in which both the problem is being studied and the formal\nmodels are grounded, (iii) the mathematical or computational language(s) with\nwhich the model is formalized, and (iv) the initial conditions for the simula-\ntions. Implicit in this list is that context includes both the assumptions that\ninform both the model structure and the conditions in which the model-based\nanalyses can be applied. Our use of context is very similar to \u00d6ren and Zeigler\n(1979) definition of experimental frame, which defines the circumstances under\nwhich a model is tested and evaluated. Experimental frames consist of obser-\nvational variables (independent and dependent measures), model and simu-\nlation initialization settings and input schedules, termination conditions, and\ndata collection and compression specifications. In many traditional modeling\napproaches, the mathematical theory dictates the key assumptions, if sufficient\ntheory has been developed prior to modeling and simulation efforts. We note\nthat the evaluation context has elements that are critical to both the verifica-\ntion and validation processes. For example, choice of a programming language\nmay dictate the types of common bugs that must be identified and corrected\nthrough verification and may dictate performance constraints that will mani-\nfest in validation metrics.\nFor many large-scale social network simulations, the theoretical foundations\nare currently in development. Consequently, articulating models within the\ntheoretical frameworks is not fully possible. We must rely on observation\nand the current state of the data to inform the assumptions of the modeling\nand simulation approaches. Clear articulation of the model assumptions is\neven more important in this case, so that the assumptions can be tracked\nbetween simulation studies, between use cases, and between data sets. Model\nassumptions will usually reflect to some degree the theoretical perspective of\nthe researchers. Knowing the assumptions is critical to determine the appro-\npriateness of a researcher\u2019s choices about analyses and model interpretations\n(Axelrod 1997).\nOutput behaviors can additionally depend on the initial conditions of the\nsimulation (Axelrod 1997). In dynamic systems, future behaviors that change\nmarkedly as a function of the starting values of the simulation are termed sen-\nsitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory is one well-known case of systemsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nMeasurements, Metrics, and Their Limitations 505\nhighly sensitive to initial conditions, because seemingly random or divergent\noutputs arise from small changes to initial conditions. We note that a common\ncriticism of modeling is that assessment of sensitivity to initial conditions or\ninput parameters often considers either only extreme parameter values, seek-\ning extreme behaviors, or midrange values, seeking representative or average\nbehaviors (Mehta 1996). Validation should seek to capture the full range of\nbehaviors on both retrospective analysis and predictive evaluations.\nThere are some unique ways in which social networks may be sensitive to\nassumptions and initial conditions relative to other dynamical systems. Net-\nwork structure and dynamics coevolve (Farajtabar et al. 2015). As networks\ngrow over time, diameters shrink, meaning that the shortest distance between\nthe furthest nodes is getting shorter (Leskovec et al. 2005). Network distance\nis computed by counting the number of links to move through the network\nbetween the two entities. So the network diameter is the largest number of\nlinks to move between any two entities in the network. Diameter is used to\ngauge the overall size of a social network, and shrinking diameters can mean\nthat people are closer to each other and information made propagate faster.\nThis can potentially affect cascade depth distributions and suggests that behav-\niors on a network may be highly sensitive to initial structure and size at the\ntime of observation. Simulations exploring the evolution of network structures\nand dynamics will need to provide periodic assessments to capture those sen-\nsitivities. This implies that we cannot evaluate the social behaviors of networks\nwithout also evaluating the structure of the network itself.\nUncertainty\nWhen comparing a single realization of a real-world social system with a single\nrealization of a simulation aiming to reproduce the dynamics of that system,\nwe must consider how sources of uncertainty from both the data and the mod-\neling approach can affect the agreement between the two. This is especially\ncrucial to properly quantify risk as a component of application validation when\nemploying the simulations in decision-making contexts.\nData uncertainty affects the training data used to calibrate the models, the\ninitial conditions used to seed them, and the testing data used to evaluate\nthem. Understanding the level of uncertainty in training data and initial\ncondition data is key to understanding the forward uncertainty propagation\nof these errors to the final output of the model. Uncertainty in the testing\ndata must be understood for proper validation of model results. For online\nsocial systems, data uncertainties can arise due to many sources including\npopulation subsampling, inferred network structure, inferred node or edge\nproperties, and missing data.\nIn addition to uncertainty in the data, uncertainty arises in model outputs\ndue to uncertainty in the model parameters as well as stochastic mechanisms inDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Nondeterministic models of complex systems will produce a range\nof simulated output even when given the same input data and initial condi-\ntions. A deterministic model dependent on some uncertain inputs will similarly\ngive a range of outputs. Thus, a single model run with a single set of assumed\ninputs or a single run of a stochastic model does not provide a full picture of the\nexpected behavior of the system. Instead, enough runs are needed to quantify\nboth the expected behavior and its uncertainty given uncertain assumptions\nand stochastic considerations. When multimodal output behavior is generated\nfrom the model, this increases the difficulty of assessing whether the observed\nreality is consistent with the simulation.\nWe note that there is an important distinction between error and uncertainty\nthat is often lost in the process of data analysis, due to some computations of\nvariability being termed error. Error may be considered actual or recognizable\ndeficiencies in the modeling and simulation process that is not attributed to\nlack of knowledge, such as a wrong assumption, an approximation, or errors in\ncomputation (Axelrod 1997). Errors of this nature should be caught and cor-\nrected in the verification process. Uncertainty, on the other hand, captures the\npotential deficiencies due to lack of knowledge (Axelrod 1997). Uncertainty has\nmany sources in modeling and simulation, as noted above. Computations of\nerror bars and confidence intervals are statistical techniques for attempting to\nquantify such uncertainty. Goodness-of-fit statistics and hypothesis testing are\nvalidation techniques that can take uncertainty into account. The challenge is\nthat even though we have some ways of accounting for uncertainty, those do\nnot usually support developing an understanding of the sources of uncertainty\n(data or model), as they are often conflated in observed data and measurement.\nGeneralizability\nBecause models are often developed to study a particular phenomenon or\nscenario, it is difficult to understand how the model will perform given new\ncontexts. In many cases, simulation is desired to explore certain counterfactual\nscenarios for purposes such as instruction, future decision support, and system\ndesign under hypothetical conditions. However, in the absence of real-world\ndata for training and evaluating these models, the validity of the resulting\noutputs for previously unobserved scenarios cannot be readily ascertained. As\nresearchers then, we want to ensure that the model has strong validity with\nrespect to underlying principles or basic phenomena that might arise across\nscenarios. This will help support determination of the appropriateness of a\nmodel for generalization to novel scenarios.\nInterpretation\nWhile the performance of a model can be measured according to certain val-\nidation metrics, the question of how to interpret the performance results is aDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nProposed Evaluation Approach 507\nkey component of the evaluation process. The purpose of validation analysis\nincludes answering a number of key questions. Is the simulation fidelity suffi-\ncient for the desired application? Under what conditions is the approach valid?\nHow does the simulation performance of each modeling approach compare\nwith performance of other modeling approaches or formalisms? How should\nthe model be modified to target improved performance? How can multiple\nmodeling approaches be combined to leverage their relative strengths? Each\ndimension of interpretation may use different metrics or aspects of the system\nperformance. This suggests that a single metric will not be adequate to support\nthorough interpretation of modeling and simulation results.\nProposed Evaluation Approach\nWhile many of the challenges and issues noted in the above section are open\nquestions without any single or easy solution, we propose a set of best prac-\ntices for comparative, reproducible validation of varied social science simula-\ntion approaches against real-world data. By adhering to common evaluation\npractices, the social modeling and simulation community can more easily share\nknowledge and adapt to new forms of data and novel modeling techniques.\nIn what follows, we outline these proposed best practices and highlight how\nthese evaluation procedures can address many of the current challenges out-\nlined above.\nConsidering the Goal of the Simulation\nBecause, by definition, a simulation cannot be successful unless it achieves its\ngoal for its intended use, understanding the stated aim and purpose of a par-\nticular simulation effort is key to designing an appropriate evaluation strategy.\nAs in \u00d6ren and Zeigler (1979) experimental frame, a model is expected to per-\nform well within the space of intended use and may perform poorly outside that\nspace. Defining the goals and related constraints on the expected performance\nlimitations is therefore key for evaluating application validity. In particular, to\nunderstand the goal of simulation, we can ask the following:\n1. What is the general use case of the simulation? The intended use of the\nmodeling and simulation output will dictate the types of metrics and other\nevaluation strategies that are needed. For example, if the simulation is\nintended to support high-consequence decision-making, the accuracy\nor precision requirements of the validation may be different than for\na simulation designed for scientific exploration of competing theories.\nIn high-consequence uses, metrics providing risk assessment through\nuncertainty analysis techniques become a more crucial component of the\nvalidation.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n508 Evaluation and Validation Approaches for Simulation of Social Behavior\n2. What phenomena is the simulation designed to capture? While there may be\na multitude of simultaneously occurring behavioral phenomena in a social\nsystem, simulations may aim to study the dynamics of particular phenomena\nthat can guide the selection of measurements. The phenomena of interest\nshould be selected to be relevant and informative to the intended use of the\nsimulation.\n3. Under what different experimental conditions should this behavior be\nreplicated? There are limits to model capabilities that may render the model\ninvalid or inappropriate if applied under incompatible conditions. For\nexample, if the simulation approach will be used for prediction of message\nspreading in select English-speaking communities, the validation domain\ncan be significantly reduced compared with a model designed to be applied\nacross global, multilingual populations.\n4. What are the particular output variables of interest and how will they be\nused? In the case of targeted simulations, such as those for decision support,\nthe nature of the information the decision-maker needs to receive as output\nfrom the model should be the focus of the evaluation measurements and\nmetrics. This includes not only the set of necessary output behaviors but also\nthe measurement scale on which they are reported (e.g. categorical output\nlike positive or negative value or a specific continuous real number).\nWe should remember that at the core, the goal of every simulation is to repro-\nduce certain dynamics, behaviors, and phenomena of the system it seeks to\nmodel. Therefore, many common principles can be applied across modeling\nefforts even while they pursue different goals and aims.\nData\nThe current online social environment provides not just unprecedented vol-\numes of data, but also unprecedented opportunities to study complete systems\nrather than samples. It also offers unprecedented opportunities to study the\nconnections among different systems, both online and offline, as information\ncan now be tracked and linked as never before.\nWhile large data volumes and cross-domain links can create new technical\nchallenges for modelers, these unique capacities can be leveraged by valida-\ntion strategies that can comprehensively specify the environment in which the\nsocial behavior occurs. This serves to mitigate issues related to the incomplete\nspecification of initial conditions that arises from treating the simulation envi-\nronment as a closed system where behavior may differ between observation and\nsimulation due to unmeasured environmental conditions.\nWhen data is collected for a simulation effort, it should be divided into three\nkey components: a set of training data to be used for model calibration andDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nProposed Evaluation Approach 509\nrefinement, a set of initial conditions data used to seed the simulations, and a\nset of testing data used to evaluate the model performance.\nFor robust evaluation of a model\u2019s capacity for generalization, it is crucial\nthat validation be performed on a held-out test set that was not observable\nby the model during training and calibration. Such cross-validation allows\ntesting of predictions and adaptability to new sources of variance rather than\nrelying solely on goodness of fit. Like the training data, the test set should be\nrepresentative of the whole system. We differentiate this from a test set that\nmight be derived from a different system, which would be a novel test set\nrather than a held-out test set. Yet, in both cases, the test sets should adhere to\nconsistent experimental frames and contain the phenomena of interest. In the\ncontext of predictive simulation, where past or current observations are used\nto predict future behaviors, a held-out data should be selected to temporally\nfollow all observed data in the training set to provide two types of evaluation.\nOne type of test examines the model\u2019s capability to make appropriate or\naccurate predictions about future unseen scenarios. This is appropriate if a\nphenomenon of interest has not changed from the training time period. The\nother type of test helps to capture changes in phenomena, like concept drift,\nby mapping the ways in which the model must change to continue to predict\nthe phenomena of interest. For example, changing event dynamics within a\nsystem may be captured by changes of a parameter, and the rate and range of\nthose parameter changes can be informative about the rate of change in the\nsystem itself.\nBecause of these temporal considerations, a traditional cross-validation strat-\negy in which multiple training and test sets are selected randomly from the data\nis often not applicable in social simulation scenarios. However, a rolling time\nwindow evaluation approach can be used to produce multiple training and test\nscenarios for more robust evaluation. We recommend that people take time to\ncharacterize their training and test sets to understand each set\u2019s patterns and\ncharacteristics. This is crucial for correctly interpreting simulation outputs.\nWe also note that time is not the only dimension along which training and\ntest sets can be created. Communities within a system can be defined by dif-\nferent demographics, like geolocation, language, or self-defined user commu-\nnities. Similar considerations must be made for training and test sets defined\nby dimensions other than time, in that researchers should characterize the sets\nto see if the phenomena of interest are present and that the sets continue to\nadhere to consistent experimental frames.\nDepending on the simulation scenario, the initial condition data may take a\nvariety of forms. For example, they could include a sample of recently observed\nactivity in the system, a set of environmental conditions, the properties of a\nparticular set of entities of interest, or some combination of these. The choice of\ninitial condition data should replicate the desired application of the simulation.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n510 Evaluation and Validation Approaches for Simulation of Social Behavior\nModeling Assumptions and Specifications\nThe preceding section on measurements and metrics outlined the difficulties\nwith applying evaluation criteria selected based on the simulation approach.\nThe remedy is to accommodate the multifaceted nature of the approaches by\nmeans of multidimensional evaluation criteria. The results of the evaluation\nneed understanding along different dimensions. Accommodation of different\ntechniques to allow fair comparison should be a priority when designing\nevaluation strategies. With the above considerations, applying a common\nevaluation framework to different approaches will enable improved compar-\nison between methods as well as potential for learning how to best combine\ndifferent modeling strategies when considering specific scenarios. A particular\nresearch direction on the multi-criteria evaluation could be the design of\ndata-driven measurements in the form of low-dimensional representations of\nentire ground truth or simulated trace sets that allow for a quick model-free\ncomparison.\nIn our example of three different simulation approaches from the section on\nmeasurements and metrics (S1 = population level, S2 = agent-based statisti-\ncal, S3 = agent-based cognitive), the evaluation strategy in its simplest form\nshould contain both the population-level time-series measurements (P) and the\nindividual-level activity measurements (I). Individual-level activity measure-\nments for the top k individual users (I k ), which is a less noisy version of I, can\nalso be included as part of the evaluation. With such an evaluation panel, on\nthe same hardware, it is possible that we end up with an evaluation matrix as\nfollows:\nMeasurement\nApproach P I I k Time (h)\nS1 Good \u2014 \u2014 1\nS2 Moderate Poor Good 12\nS3 Good Moderate Good 48\nThus, the multidimensional nature of the evaluation strategy can point out\nthe complete set of trade-offs between the capabilities of the simulation\napproaches, the computation time, and the performance of the correspond-\ning simulation compared across different measurements and metrics. It is\napparent that the multi-criteria evaluation should incorporate, at a minimum,\nthe union set of the indicators at which each modeling approach excels\nwith additional criteria included for more insights. For example, we can add\ncommunity-scale metrics in the above example to gain insight about group\nbehavior. The following sections elaborate on the various aspects of multi-\ncriteria evaluation.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nProposed Evaluation Approach 511\nMeasurements\nThere are many factors that influence the choice of measurements to com-\npare between simulation outputs and ground truth observations. While a prime\nconsideration is the targeted purpose of the simulations, it is often beneficial to\nprobe the performance of a model beyond its direct purpose to enable both\nimproved interpretation of the results and improved understanding of how\nthe model might generalize to new contexts. While typically validation is per-\nformed on only a single observed phenomenon, we propose probing multiple\nfacets of the simulated behavior using a set of varied quantitative measurements\nto probe different scales, data attributes, and behavior types.\nAn evaluation strategy that leverages these multiple facets of evaluation can\nprovide increased interpretability of performance results. Greater insight into\nthe success of a modeling approach can be achieved by measuring performance\nacross multiple scales including across network scales (e.g. node level, group\nlevel, and population level), activity scales (e.g. more vs. less active entities), and\ntemporal scales (e.g. batch properties vs. temporal trends; shorter vs. longer\nelapsed intervals after the initial conditions). Second, by faceting the evalua-\ntion across data properties, such as population demographics, we can study how\nperformance varies across conditions, and the relative success in different con-\nditions tells us about the appropriate operating conditions of the model. Finally,\nwe can study the generalizability of the approach by performing evaluation of\nmultiple phenomena such as cascades, recurrence, gatekeepers, and persistent\ngroups. This ensures the approach can capture multiple facets of behavior in\nany complex social system.\nIt is also important to select measurements for evaluating system behaviors\nthat are agnostic to the initial conditions. Measurement and analysis of the\noutputs should emphasize the behaviors of interest, defined without special\nconsideration of the specific model definitions. Then, we might define a con-\nsistent set of measurements to apply across models and initial conditions for\ndirect comparisons. In this way we can define measurements about the distri-\nbutions of output behaviors, statistics about the top k performing agents in the\nnetwork, or metrics about the individual agent behaviors. This enables insights\nat and potentially across multiple levels of system resolution.\nWhile many typical measurements probe the emergent patterns of behavior\nin a simulation, particular measurements such as TE can be designed that probe\ncausal mechanisms. Some of the issues with characterization of causal influence\nvia TE that we enumerated earlier can be mitigated by careful experimentation\nand interpretation as elaborated next. The issues related to parameter selection\nin the computation of TE have been investigated in detail in Sathanur and Jand-\nhyala (2014) and Wibral et al. (2013). Wibral et al. (2013) proposed sweeping\nthe TE value with delay and using the maximum value of the resulting para-\nmetric sweep. The significance of TE value can be understood by comparingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The strength of causal influence can be understood, for example,\nby characterizing the TE between two Gaussian processes or Bernoulli pro-\ncesses with a known delay and correlation. Misinterpretation of spurious high\nTE values can be somewhat mitigated by computing TE values for entity pairs\nthat are related to each other. For example, it makes sense to compute TE values\nbetween members of the same friends group, team, and community as opposed\nto random pairs of individuals.\nMetrics\nIn combination with the multifaceted measurement approach, a set of metrics\nfor comparison of the measurements between simulation and ground truth\nmust be employed. A strong set of metrics allows both the determination of\nthe validity of an individual simulation approach and the robust comparison of\nthe relative performance among different approaches. Given a single measure-\nment, such as the activity level of users within a social network, three separate\nlevels of metrics can be employed to probe the agreement from the macro to\nthe micro level.\nDistributional\nComparisons of distributions between the simulation and the ground truth\nprovide a mechanism for probing the broader trends observed in the scenario.\nDistributional comparison can be used to evaluate the range of behavior\nobserved in an individual, group, or population. Examples of metrics that can\nbe employed for this comparison include Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence and the\nKolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test.\nRankings\nTo probe the simulation results in more detail, we can move beyond distribu-\ntional comparisons and evaluate the relative properties of specific entities in\nthe scenario. For example, we can move beyond comparing the distribution\nof the number of actions across a population and determine if the simulation\ncaptured those individuals responsible for high-volume activity and those who\nwere relatively inactive. Possible metrics for this purpose include the Spearman\nrank-order correlation and the rank-biased overlap (Webber et al. 2010).\nOne to One\nAt this level, metrics delve even deeper into individual-level behavior, by\ndetermining if the simulation captured the specific activity of individuals. For\nexample, we can perform one-to-one comparison of activity volume on a per\nuser basis in a social network. Metrics that perform one-to-one comparisonDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

If the general distributions of behavior prove to be trivially\npredicted by all approaches, more fine-grained comparison can distinguish\nmodel performance at the micro level. Alternatively, if simulation of exact\nindividual behavior proves too challenging in a given context, then comparison\nat the level of distributions or rankings may provide the appropriate scale for\nrelative evaluations.\nBecause simulation of complex social systems must capture the dynamics of\nthe emergent behavior in the system, the evaluation of temporal dynamics of\na simulation should receive special attention. Temporal patterns can be com-\npared in several formats, including event sequence data and time-series mea-\nsurements. Sequence comparison metrics, such as the Levenshtein distance,\ncan answer questions about whether events occur in the correct order without\nconcern over the inter-event timing, which can be a proxy for causal patterns\nin the data. When comparing numeric time-series measurements rather than\nevent sequences, we can use error metrics such as RMSE or more flexible met-\nrics such as dynamic time warping (M\u00fcller 2007). By probing both exact match\nand trend validity, we can perform evaluation of qualitative trends using rigor-\nous quantitative methods.\nEvaluation Procedures\nA robust evaluation procedure will include the use of the training data for\nmodel calibration and training, while the initial condition and test data are\nreserved until the models are finalized. Once the single or multiple sets\nof initial conditions are released, the resulting simulated behavior can be\ncompared with that observed in the testing data. Any performance gains\nachieved through model modifications after observations of the validation\nresults on the test data may not be indicative of the true potential of the model\nto generalize to new situations but instead may indicate overfitting to the\nparticular test cases used.\nTo properly assess model uncertainty and sensitivity to initial conditions, we\nmust build on the basic evaluation procedure of simply comparing a single run\nof the simulation with the observed ground truth. Evaluation of stochastic mod-\nels can instead be performed on a population of simulation runs rather than a\nsingle iteration to study both the expected simulation variability and the mod-\neling uncertainty.\nUnderstanding how the output behaviors of a system vary with initial condi-\ntions requires model exploration.

Complexity is not necessarily coded into the agent-\nbased model, as it might be in a coupled nonlinear dynamic system model.\nThus, exploration is needed to find both the expected and unexpected\nsystem behaviors. Systematic exploration of the initial conditions, such as\ngrid search through input parameter space, is the foundation of the study\nof sensitivity to initial conditions. In an environment where data is now\ncollected at large enough scale that observations can be made of the same\nphenomenon under numerous environmental perturbations, often differing\nonly slightly, we are able to perform an empirical study of this sensitivity.\nEmploying a range of initial condition scenarios each observed in the ground\ntruth data allows a systematic comparison between initial condition sensitivity\nas observed in the real world and the sensitivity exhibited by the models, a\ntechnique that is supported by the increasingly complete and complex available\ndata sets.\nBecause initial condition sensitivity may especially arise in the presence of\nnonlinear effects with high path dependence, we can gain additional insight into\nthis effect by measuring simulation performance as a function of time elapsed\nsince the initial conditions. Understanding the dynamics of model performance\nprovides key input into properly limiting the domain of applicability for the\nsimulation.\nInterpretation\nThere are three primary objectives to the interpretation of a set of evaluation\nresults: (i) determining whether a given approach is valid for its stated objec-\ntives and under what specific conditions, (ii) comparing between multiple\nsimulation approaches to identify their relative success, and (iii) identifying\ntargeted improvements to modeling techniques. While a great deal of focus is\ntypically placed on the first two objectives, less attention has been paid to the\nthird that would allow us to answer why a certain approach fails, when it works\nwell, and how to make improvements (Campbell and Bolton 2005).\nBy probing different resolutions, scales, population subsets, and phenomena,\nwe can ascertain the conditions where a model performs well and where it falls\nshort. When performing a comparative evaluation of multiple approaches, we\ncan gain insight by observing the correlation in performance among the mul-\ntiple metrics. That is, which groups of metrics tend to rise or fall together? For\nexample, does increased performance on predicting the timing of recurring\nactivity bursts correlate with increased performance predicting the volume of\nthose bursts? This can provide crucial feedback on potential improvements to\nthe approach.\nOn the other hand, are there trade-offs to consider among the various\ndimensions of evaluation?

Further, to meet standards of validation toward\nmodel accreditation, we must ensure that the approaches selected predict\nbehavior in a way that is relevant and appropriate for the intended use of the\nmodel (U.S. Department of Defense 2011).\nFinally, by identifying approaches that perform well on different groups of\nmetrics, one can leverage the particular strengths of these different techniques\nby selecting the appropriate model for a given application or by applying a com-\nbination of models using an ensemble (Tebaldi and Knutti 2007) or modular\n(Portegies Zwart et al. 2012) approach.\nConclusions\nThe ever-increasing volumes and varieties of data available to support the mod-\neling and simulation of social-behavioral phenomena provide both challenges\nand opportunities for model validation. We now have increased capability to\nperform rigorous, repeatable, quantitative evaluation of social-behavioral mod-\neling at scale through comparison with observed ground truth and qualita-\ntive interactions. These new opportunities for rigorous evaluation can best be\nleveraged by the community through the adoption of common standards and\napproaches for data selection, selection of validation criteria, and implemen-\ntation of evaluation procedures. However, there are many ongoing unsolved\nvalidation challenges that should receive continued attention in future research.\nThese include the development of novel measurements and metrics to support\nmodel-agnostic comparison and improved methods for interpreting validation\nresults to support insights into model improvements and methods for leverag-\ning the strengths of varied available approaches. Indeed, a key contribution of\nvalidation efforts is a reduced opacity of models through improved capabilities\nto inspect and interpret them (Pew et al. 2005). Ultimately, there is much to\nbe gained through the development of novel techniques for comparative and\nreproducible validation of computational social models, because such models,\nif they can be meaningfully and empirically tested, will provide unprecedented\ninsights into human behavior.\nReferences\nAdamic, L.A., Lento, T.M., Adar, E., and Ng, P.C.

When Ostrom (2005) published the Institutional Analysis and\nDevelopment (IAD) framework, she recognized the difficulty in describing\ncomplex institutions and the spaces in which they operate. The framework\nprovides a tool for organizing inquiry and description of institutions by provid-\ning researchers with a set of questions to answer, which, when all are answered,\nprovide a thorough description and analysis of that institution. Both identified\na common challenge for complex computational models: describing models\nis itself a difficult and complicated task. Both responded to this challenge by\nproviding a framework to guide researchers\u2019 efforts in meeting this challenge.\nOstrom\u2019s framework guides the design of conceptual models, while Grimm\net al.\u2019s framework guides the description of computational models. Neither\nframework guides the translation of theories and conceptual models into com-\nputational models. Like the specification of statistical or econometric models\n(Kennedy 2003), this process is left largely for the researcher to determine and\napply. An additional framework, one that can help bridge the gap between\nconceptual, modeling, and technical languages used in different fields, is now\nneeded to support the growing use of ABMs in the social sciences.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Econometrics was sufficiently devel-\noped to be recognized, and its meaning debated more than half a century ago\n(Tintner 1953). Game theory undergirded the US strategies during the Cold\nWar (Schelling 1960, 1966). Network analytic techniques are now regularly\nused in a variety of fields, particularly including sociology, political science,\nand policy science (Borgatti et al. 2009; Comfort et al. 2011; Koliba et al.\n2011). The growing use of network analysis and simulation, along with a clear\narticulation of an epistemology for applying ABMs\u2019 generative capabilities to\nthe social sciences (Epstein 2006), is helping to drive the emergence of a new\nfield, computational social science (CSS), that brings together researchers with\ncomputational backgrounds and researchers with social scientific backgrounds\nto apply ever more sophisticated computational analytic techniques to social\nscientific research questions.\nIt is the interdisciplinary nature of CSS that enables and necessitates\ncollaboration between social and computational scientists, many of whom now\nidentify as data scientists. In utilizing modeling and simulation approaches,\nthis collaboration has the potential to make monumental changes in address-\ning society\u2019s most challenging problems in ways not previously possible.\nOpportunities resulting from these collaborative efforts are many (Epstein\n2008). Social scientists provide substantive theories, guiding the development\nof hypotheses on whether, when, and under what conditions certain behaviors\noccur. Computational scientists and statisticians test these hypotheses with\nadvanced techniques analyzing empirical and model-generated social scientific\ndata to identify what and when certain social scientific phenomena will take\nplace. Although this collaboration can lead to breakthrough innovations that\nno discipline could produce single-handedly, just as with any interdisciplinary\nteam project, a primary obstacle is establishing a common language for effec-\ntive communication among researchers with diverse backgrounds. Though we\nuse the term language, it is not necessarily that this be a full-fledged natural\nor computer language, but a common ground for scientific reasoning. What\nmatters is that the concepts and terms that each member of a CSS research\nteam uses are understood by the other members of the team. Without such a\ncommon language, the collaboration is unlikely to succeed.\nThe Stakeholders\nThree stakeholder groups are important for the success of a CSS research effort:\nModeling and simulation specialists: Modeling and simulation specialists have\nthe necessary knowledge for constructing computer models and simulation\nto replicate complex system phenomena. They understand the capabilitiesDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Importantly, they recognize\nthe requirement for a model to have enough detail to be computationally\nimplemented and understand how to analyze simulation output. For\nexample, starting from a generic ABM simulation, experts are able to put\nforth questions that help define how a model must be constructed so that it\ncan provide an answer to the research question.\nSocial scientists: Social scientists in this context are the domain experts. With-\nout the input from social scientists, the models built by simulation experts\nand data scientists might fail to leverage the existing body of knowledge from\nthe social sciences. As a result, these models, in turn, might fail to answer\nquestions grounded in social science theory. Despite the comprehensiveness\nof the ABM implementation tools and even the availability of design docu-\nmentation (ODD/ODD+D), domain experts will often have a difficult time\nproducing ABMs to suit their work. Social scientists often struggle in imple-\nmenting ABMs as a computer program without the computational back-\nground to mathematically define and describe the concepts and relationships\ncontained in theories. For example, rules for movement of agents are com-\nmonly overlooked: what does a movement in the horizontal direction mean\nin relation to a movement in the vertical direction in a social context?\nData scientists/machine learning experts: Data scientists and machine learn-\ning experts specialize in the knowledge and skills in using advanced ana-\nlytic techniques that can be used to test the theories proposed by the social\nscientists. Though many social scientists regularly perform their own anal-\nyses, they often cannot stay up to date with the plethora of methodological\ndevelopments or the scripting languages upon which the newest tools and\ntechniques rely. For example, in a model of social media, the domain expert\nmay realize the importance of influence, yet not have the expertise to extract\ninfluence from the big data resulting from social media. In turn, the data\nscientist may not know which variables to look at in their search for user\ninfluence. This is where the communication between the data expert and the\ndomain expert is crucial.\nNeed for a Lingua Franca\nThe answers to today\u2019s most exciting research questions lie buried in large data\nsets. These data sets are often unstructured and have complex relationships,\nrequiring specialized, cutting-edge computational analyses. As will be fully\ndeveloped in the next section, the different stakeholder groups rely on diverg-\ning sets of concepts, methods, and lexicons. In many cases, the same specific\nterm may have vastly different meanings in each stakeholder group.

The ABMC is\ninspired by the Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder et al. 2014). Using a\nsimilar approach, the ABMC visualizes all key CSS project building blocks\ninto a single paged canvas. This representation allows the multidisciplinary\ndiscussion, design, and iterative refinement of the CSS project. A completed\nABMC is able to completely define the requirements of a CSS research effort,\nincluding the guiding theories; the concepts, variables, and relationships; the\ndata required for hypothesis building; the construction of the ABM itself; the\nexpected target output; and the data and methods for the validation and output\nanalysis. The Canvas consists of nine building blocks that a CSS research team\nmust define in order to fully specify an ABM-guided CSS project. It acts as a\nframework, similar to ODD and IAD, for guiding the construction of ABMs\nusing steps drawn from the scientific method that is common to all scientists.\nABM-based CSS research is the result of two, usually iterative, processes.\nThe ABMC is highly visual so that it can easily encapsulate and communicate\nthese processes to researchers from all fields. First, during the hypothesis build-\ning process, the input of domain and data experts is drawn upon to construct\nmeaningful theory- and data-verified testable hypotheses for the model to test.\nThe hypotheses building process ensures that the ABM is grounded in relevant\nsocial scientific theories. Second, the model construction and experimentation\nprocess uses the hypotheses for model construction. The model construction\nand experimentation process ensures that the models perform as desired, accu-\nrately and effectively implementing the relevant theories and producing output\nthat can be used to test the chosen hypotheses. Both processes require data\nthough for separate purposes. The first process relies on empirical data gath-\nered about the context that is being modeled and uses those data for filling\ngaps in substantive the knowledge of theories and the modeling context. The\nsecond process relies more heavily on model-generated data for model vali-\ndation and output exploration, often comparing model-generated data against\nempirical data.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

They are the medi-\nums through which theories and concepts are expressed, data are structured\nand analyzed, and results are interpreted, all in the service or testing hypothe-\nses and providing evidence for and against theories. Social scientists, modeling\nand simulation experts, and data scientists/machine learning experts have dif-\nferent languages for communication within their respective fields. These lan-\nguages help with knowledge representation and dissemination by building a\ncommon lexicon with highly refined definitions that allow quick, easy, and suc-\ncinct expression of complicated ideas. However, in the case where the research\noutcomes are the result of interdisciplinary teams working toward transdisci-\nplinary outcomes, these multiple communication streams render the lexicons\nuninterpretable, and communication breaks down. Jargon from one camp is\nmisunderstood by the other, and the shared mental model is never truly com-\nmunicated across the various experts. In this section we explore some existing\nefforts of research communication in the three disciplines considered in the\nCSS efforts and emphasize the disparity between them.\nThe Modelers\nAgent-based modeling has become a common approach to answer social\nscience research questions through simulation. ABMs deal with large orders\nof agents, each activated at every discrete time step. Within a given time step,\nan agent must plan and perform actions that can range in computational com-\nplexity. Due to the massive amount of computations, agent-based simulation\nexperiments must make use of the computing power of modern computers.\nAgent-based modeling toolkits encapsulate and implement functions common\nacross ABMs such as the scheduler, which determines the order in which\nagents act per time step. In doing so, they provide a further level of abstraction\nupon which model developers can skip the detail necessary to implement\nsuch a project directly on a lower-level language such as Java or C++, by\nproviding a scripting interface. For example, Repast Simphony, written in Java,\nand RepastHPC, written in C++, are abstracted through ReLogo; NetLogo,\nwhich provides NetLogo scripting language, is an abstraction of Java and\nScala implementations; and AnyLogic, again an implementation in Java, is\nabstracted as a visual programming language, which allows the developer to\norganize blocks of encapsulated agent behaviors.\nThus, the entirety of the ABM is captured through the programming lan-\nguage used to implement it. Yet, it is usually unreadable to domain experts.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

To address this issue, ABM documenta-\ntion standards have emerged such as ODD and the human decision-making\nspecific version of ODD, ODD+D (ODD + Decision) (Grimm et al. 2006, 2010).\nThe ODD standards help frame the ABM itself highlighting:\nPurpose, Entities, state variables, and scales, Process overview and schedul-\ning, Design Concepts (Basic principles, Emergence, Adaptation, Objectives,\nLearning, Prediction, Sensing, Interaction, Stochasticity, Collectives, Observa-\ntion), Initialization, Input data, and sub models In setting this standard, ODD\nhas given the modeling community a standard for communicating complex\nmodels that is easily understood throughout the community. By doing this,\nODD provides not a tool for modeling but a tool for communication.\nSocial Scientific Languages in CSS\nCertain communication standards are prevalent in the social science literature,\nthough many lack the broad standards of practice that make their manner of use\nconsistent across fields. Concept maps are common artifacts embodying social\nscience concepts and research outcomes (Novak 2010). However, no standard\nexists (Roth and Roychoudhury 1992; Kinchin et al. 2000; Kamsu-Foguem et al.\n2014; Raei and Kardan 2015; Dipeolu et al. 2016; Schwendimann and Linn 2016;\nHaymovitz et al. 2017; Fu et al. 2017).\nFrames (Minsky 1975) and factor trees (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2013) offer\nsocial scientific tools that are closer in their execution to the tools used by\nmodelers and data scientists. Frames have helped the artificial intelligence\ncommunity define knowledge representation and flow. Knowledge represen-\ntations are common to both the social sciences and artificial intelligence.\nGood knowledge representations can be directly converted into models\nthat can be programmed into a computer to simulate reality and may have\nsymbolic representations or nonsymbolic representations (Ramirez and\nValdes 2012). Factor trees were introduced specifically to link individual\nhuman behaviors with the factors that influence those behaviors and the\nchoice between them (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2013). Since trees are developed\nusing a high-level visual programming language, such as Analytica (Davis\nand O\u2019Mahony 2013), the tree is not only a specification of behaviors and\ntheir motivating factors but also an initial implementation of a model. The\nfactor tree should then be easily reviewable and readily reprogrammed into a\ncomputational model, regardless of which modeling or programming language\nmay be used.\nNatural language narrative is the norm in describing social theories (Czar-\nniawska 2004).

This manner\nof usage presents difficulties for researchers trying to translate case studies\ninto computational models. An additional analytic step becomes necessary\nto further case study results and conclusions before machine-readable mod-\neling code can be constructed. Several researchers have promoted the use\nof mathematics-friendly representations such as Petri nets (K\u00f6hler et al.\n2007; Casas 2013), Discrete Event System Specifications (DEVS) (Zeigler\n1989), Unified Modeling Language (UML) (Fowler and Scott 2000), or SysML\n(Weilkiens 2011). While the social sciences are witnessing a growing use\nof these methods, the standards for their use as well as the communication\nof their implementation and results are still evolving and inconsistent, with\nmany researchers preferring to adapt the traditional structures for explaining\nresearch methods to include explanations of algorithms and, sometimes, the\ninclusion of code as an appendix.\nData Analysis Languages\nHigh-level scripting languages, like Matlab/Octave, R, or Python, are com-\nmon for data analysis or machine learning efforts that happen in computer\nscience, statistics, or mathematics, where they offer a much more direct\nlink to modeling and programming languages. With a script written in a\nscripting language, the exact detailed steps of an analysis or algorithm can be\ncoded and executed in a highly repeatable format. Algorithms are commonly\ncommunicated in the form of pseudo-code (Horowitz et al. 1997) or flowcharts\nor implemented through scripting language packages, which provide complete\nand vetted code for running complex or highly tailored commands. These are\nready to implement, sometimes automatically, particularly in the case of pack-\nages. Large-scale softwares designed for such research are described in UML\n(Fowler and Scott 2000). All of these methods have been established with the\ndirect conversion to computer programming languages in mind. Discrepancies\nmay exist, for example, due to differences among object-oriented program-\nming, functional programming, etc. Less often formal grammars and their\nmany variants (Chomsky 1956) can be used to specify a complete functional\nset used for computer programming. The benefit of using a scripting language\nis that it can easily be rendered into advanced computer and modeling code\nsince it is already written in a type of programming language. The challenge is\nthat writing the script often requires the same cross-disciplinary boundaries as\ndesigning and implementing an ABM. Indeed, in some ABM platforms, such\nas RSiena, the tools and procedure for coding a script and a model is identical,\nand the result largely indistinguishable.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Social theories are typically very abstract and aim to explain or interpret\nsocial phenomena. Theories often are not stated in a falsifiable manner, mean-\ning that they are rarely amenable to direct or easy testing. A theory, however,\ncan be tested by rendering it into a set of more specific and concrete instances,\ncalled hypotheses. In identifying the relevant theories for a research project,\nand consequently filling this building block of the ABMC, we ask questions\nsuch as: What known theories are we basing our model on? What emotional,\nrational, social human behavioral theories are we using? What network theories\nor other theories?\nOnce the answers to these questions are identified, for a theory to gener-\nate more precise research questions, it must have a clear focus on a set of key\nconcepts explained through a set of key variables. The concepts help define the\ntheory, making it more specific and more testable by defining the broad ideas\nupon which the theory is built (Kerlinger and Lee 2000). Variables further refine\nthe definitions of concepts and provide specific and measurable operationaliza-\ntions of those concepts. The variables are amenable to testing since they can be\nobserved and measured. Questions such as What big ideas does the theory use?\nor How are the concepts defined? can help fill key concepts block of the ABMC.\nAlso, in order to identify the key variables, a researcher should ask: What con-\nstructs describe and define the concepts? How can the constructs be defined and\nmeasured using the data we have available?\nIn the next step, the ABMC asks for the key relationships interrelating the\ninvolved variables. For example, we should ask: How do the variables correlate?\nWhat are the casual relationships between variables? What functional form\ndoes the casual relationship take?\nThe relationships between variables provide the content needed to define\nand test hypotheses. Hypotheses, according to the scientific method, have been\ndefined as \u201cstatement(s) or prediction(s) about a phenomenon that should\nbe observed if a particular theory is accurate (Shaughnessy and Zechmeister\n1985). In the context of ABM, these hypotheses will drive agent behavior,\nwhich, in turn, will determine the simulation output needed to test those\nhypotheses. To fill this building block of the ABMC, we try to answer questions\nsuch as What relationship do we want to experiment within the model? or\nWhat relationships will best explain agent\u2019s target behaviors?\nAs an example of how hypotheses can be derived from existing theories,\nconsider Milkman\u2019s study of How Race and Gender Biases Impact Students inDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In Milkman\u2019s study, a group\nof researchers hypothesize that race would play a role in shaping how univer-\nsity professors respond to prospective graduate students who express interest in\ntheir research. In order to test this hypothesis, they measured email responses\nof 6500 professors across 250 of the US top universities to the messages sent by\nstudents, who showed admiration to the research of those professors and asked\nfor a meeting. Their study strengthened the hypothesis of \u201cfaculties are biased\nin favor of white men.\u201d\nFeagin\u2019s theory on systemic racism is the relevant theory for this study, which\nalong with its content help fill the theory block of the ABMC. The key concepts\nare race, racial bias, and interpersonal interactions between professors and\nprospective graduate students. Operationalizations of these concepts include\nthe identified professor population and the relevant content of their email\ncorrespondence with perspective students. Accordingly, the hypothesis being\ntested by Milkman, based on Feagin\u2019s theory, was that there are differences in\nhow the professors respond to prospective students of different races, measured\nthrough differences in the email correspondence.\nFrom Hypothesis to Model: Data-Driven Calibration and Model\nDiscovery\nHypotheses are clear, specific, and falsifiable statements or predictions. These\ncharacteristics make them testable. Similar to the process of translating the-\nories into testable hypotheses, several steps are needed to generate a set of\ninterpretable models from a set of hypotheses. Furthermore, there is often more\nthan one plausible theory explaining a phenomenon. No matter if the exist-\ning theories are complementary or competing, it may be necessary to identify\nand consider all plausible theories that offer explanations of the phenomena\nof interest. In this case, it might be crucial for a modeling framework, such as\nABM, to consider not one but multiple social theories (along with their asso-\nciated hypotheses) that are competing or cooperating to drive agent actions.\nABMs enable replicating and predicting socioeconomic systems through char-\nacterizing the behaviors and interactions of the agents. The behaviors of the\nagents, in turn, are indicated by a set of rules derived from the relevant theo-\nries. In order to fill this block, we need to identify the following: What actions\ncan agents take? Why would an agent take a given action? What would an agent\ngain from taking that action?\nAnother entity called the environment is also needed to drive the behavior\nand dynamics of the agents. The environment exists to determine how\nthe model links to the project\u2019s context and also to implement the rules for the\nphysical, conceptual, or reified space in which agents act.

How are they allowed to act in each space?\nWhat environmental variables will be used? How do these variables affect the\nagents?\nBefore using an ABM to perform a forecast on a real system, one needs to\nensure that the ABM is relatively capable of recreating observed phenomena.\nThis process is called validation. A crucial step in validating any ABM is\ncalibration, which is typically performed by comparing the resulting output of\nthe constructed model with that of the real system. Note that an ABM-based\nsimulation is often characterized by a set of variables:\n1. Parameters of the model driving the simulation dynamics and define agent\npopulations.\n2. Initial conditions such as the characteristics of the agent populations and\nenvironmental state.\n3. The relative weights given to certain parameters.\nThe calibration process can be achieved by tuning the associated variables for\ndesired output. This block of the Canvas concerns how the model will be evalu-\nated, how the model will be validated, and what distributions or functions will\nbe used as metrics.\nFinding the best set of parameters typically involves an optimization problem\nwith respect to a loss or objective function, capturing the distance between the\nmodel\u2019s simulated output and the real experimental data. Parameter tuning,\nmost often, requires exploring an extensive parameter space. This motivates\nautomated machine learning-based or computational strategies, which facili-\ntate faster and more efficient explorations of the parameter space. The result of\nthis validation process will provide insight into the:\n1. Basins of attraction of the phenomenon being simulated.\n2. Plausible archetypes/characteristics of entities in the real world.\n3. Importance of factors of behavior.\nAt the end, if the calibration fails to produce a sufficiently accurate fit to the\nempirical data, one can conclude that the hypothesis being tested is invalid,\nthat is, the underlying hypotheses cannot explain the phenomena of interest. In\nother words, ABM rules and populations do not sufficiently match those of the\nreal system. In this case, the modeling team should consider alternative theo-\nries and different testable hypotheses. A possible approach to perform this task\nis to apply an evolutionary model discovery technique. This approach allows\nthe researcher to explore multiple candidate models embodying existing theo-\nries of micro-behavior rules for the agents (Gunaratne and Garibay 2017, 2018).\nAlthough the need for this type of rule-space exploration has been emphasized\nfor a while (Epstein 1999, 2006), it has not generally been sufficiently investi-\ngated.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We\ntake two of the most well-studied ABMs and use the ABMC to fully describe\nthem: Schelling\u2019s seminal work on segregation modeling (Schelling 1969), a\ngood example of an abstract model of a social science concept that provides\nintriguing insights, and the Long House Valley project\u2019s Artificial Anasazi\nmodel (Dean et al. 2000), one of the first CSS models to be compared to data\nand have computational calibration efforts (Stonedahl and Wilensky 2010b)\nand model discovery efforts (Gunaratne and Garibay 2018) applied to. The\npurpose of choosing these examples is to allow future transdisciplinary teams\nguidance toward the application of ABMC in their own CSS efforts.\nSchelling\u2019s Segregation Model\nThe ABMC of Schelling\u2019s segregation model (Schelling 1969) is shown in\nFigure 22.2. The nine building blocks are as follows:\nTheory: The theory used is an household-level description of discrimination,\none motivated by statistical observations about the impact of racial segrega-\ntion in the United States.\nKey concepts: Segregation is driven by individual-level neighbor preferences.\nThose of a similar race can require that a minimum fraction of immediate\nneighbors are of the same race. Until this threshold is met, the individual is\nunsatisfied and seeks an alternate living situation.\nKey variables:\n1. Parameter: White\u2019s threshold of tolerance of immediate neighbors of sim-\nilar race.\n2. Parameter: Black\u2019s threshold of tolerance of immediate neighbors of sim-\nilar race.\n3. Initial condition: Fraction of region\u2019s population that is white.\n4. Initial condition: Fraction of region\u2019s population that is black.\nKey relationships: H i = si > ki where H i is the binary residential satisfaction of\nthe individual, si is the ratio of similar neighbors around the individual, and\nki is the desired minimum of neighbors of similar race by the individual.\nIf happiness is not met, the agent should relocate to a new, free residence.\nHypothesis building data: Data on the correlation of race an economic status\nprovided by Pascal (1967).\nHypothesis:\n1. Segregation is the result of individual racial preferences, and segregation\npatterns can result from even modest preference ratios.\n2. There exist a tipping point in the dynamics of segregation, dependent on\nthe similar race wanted parameter, for which the entire neighborhood can\nbe completely occupied by one race or the other.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

There may even exist unstable equilibria for certain tolerance schedules.\n5. Depending on tolerance schedules, tipping points may exist beyond which\nthe eventual complete occupation of a region by one race is inevitable.\nArtificial Anasazi\nIn Figure 22.3 we consider ABMC applied to the Artificial Anasazi model (Dean\net al. 2000) and some of the calibration (Stonedahl and Wilensky 2010b) and\nmodel discovery efforts applied on it (Gunaratne and Garibay 2017, 2018).\nTheory:\n1. Agriculture was a centerpiece of Pueblo cultures (Dean et al. 2000).\n2.

Initial condition: Variables of the land important to agriculture such as\nquality of soil and yield.\n3. Initial condition: The annual nutritional need of households.\n4. Initial condition: Distribution of the threshold of the fertility of house-\nholds.\n5. Initial condition: Distribution of the age of mortality of households.\n6. State variable: Quantity of food stored from previous harvest by house-\nhold.\nKey relationships:\n1. If the household age is past the reproduction threshold of the agent, it may\nreproduce.\n2. If the household mortality is exceeded, the household must die.\n3. Households have a separate plot for farming.\n4. If household\u2019s receive more harvest than their nutritional requirement,\nthe excess is stored.\n5. If the household\u2019s farm fails to produce the required nutritional require-\nment, the household must relocate and find a new nearby farm. If no such\nplots are left, the household will perish.\nHypothesis building data:\n1. Data collected through archaeological digs during the course of the Long\nHouse Valley project were used to determine the demographics of the\nKayenta Anasazi (Dean et al. 2000). The data gave insights into the typical\npopulation count of a household (five individuals).\n2. Conditions of the Valley itself changed over the course of time. Data from\narchaeological digs made estimates to soil quality, possible crop yields,\nand water availability across the Valley.\nHypothesis: Agricultural favorability of the environment dictated the popula-\ntion carrying capacity of the Anasazi in the Long House Valley. The disap-\npearance of the Anasazi from the Valley in 1350 CE is explainable by the\ninability of the Valley to support the nutritional need of the Anasazi through\nagriculture.\nAgent rules:\n1. Die if mortality is exceeded.\n2. Reproduce if age exceeds fertility threshold.\n3. Collect harvest; if harvest is greater than nutritional need, store the rest.\n4.

Populate grid with annual water availability, dryness, quality of soil, and\npotential yield data from archaeological studies.\n3. Update the grid variables with every progressing simulation year.\nValidation data: The household population data of the Valley from 800 CE\nto 1350 CE from the Long House Valley project was used to validate the\nsimulation output (Dean et al. 2000). This data was used for model calibra-\ntion (Janssen 2009; Stonedahl and Wilensky 2010b) and for identifying factor\nimportance in farm plot selection through model discovery (Gunaratne and\nGaribay 2018).\nTarget output: The environmental factors modeled were hypothesized to be\nable to explain the disappearance of the Anasazi from the Long House Valley\naround 1350 CE. However, it was shown that the considered factors were not\nsufficient to explain this.\nIn further studies, Janssen (2009) demonstrates that the carrying capacity of\nthe Valley (the number of potential farm plots), determined by the environ-\nmental factors of the Valley, was a strong driver of the population of Anasazi in\nthe Valley, in comparison with the agent parameters (fertility, mortality, etc.).\nIn Gunaratne and Garibay (2018) this result is strengthened by discovering and\nranking the importance of factors of farm selection through data-driven evolu-\ntionary model discovery. It is shown that quality of soil, yield of farms, and social\npresence (two factors affecting the carrying capacity and the last an emergent\nresult of agent decisions) are actually stronger determinants of the population\nin the Valley than the other variables.\nConclusion\nWe are now witnessing the rise of a new paradigm at the intersection of social,\ncomputer, and data science. This interdisciplinary field needs a common\nlanguage for effective communication between researchers with highly varied\nbackgrounds, skill sets, and research cultures.

Glazner 2\n1 Modeling, Simulation, Experimentation, and Analytics, The MITRE Corporation, Hampton, VA 23666, USA\n2 Modeling, Simulation, Experimentation and Analytics, The MITRE Corporation, McLean, VA 22103, USA\nIntroduction\nScientific work in all domains follows a set of common principles and guide-\nlines that ensure high-quality research, dissemination of the results, and\nthe general contribution to the archived body of knowledge that provides a\ncomprehensive and concise representation of concepts, terms, and activities\nneeded to make up a professional scientific domain. Therefore, scientific work\nrequires one to comprehend, share, and reproduce research results to increase\nknowledge over time. Given the complexity of the world around us, this is\noften accomplished using models that represent a scientific theory in a more\ngenerally comprehensible and testable form. In his work, Goldman (2006)\ndescribes the development of science as a series of models that either evolve by\nintegrating new research results or that must be replaced due to revolutionary\nnew insights by new models.\nThe use of simulation in support of such efforts is increasingly accepted\nin engineering disciplines (Mittal et al. 2017). Computational sciences allow\nthe execution of hypotheses or theories that are captured in a mathematical\nmodel and implemented in a computer program, demonstrating a causal link\nbetween theory and behavior. While real-world social systems are far more\ncomplex than most physical systems and therefore more difficult to model, we\ncan gain insight from making purposefully simplified representations of social\nsystems and associated hypotheses executable. Multiple models, each bringing\na unique perspective, are possible. Further, exploding data collected on social\nsystems are opening the door to the creation of more accurate models of\nsocial systems and behaviors (Pentland 2015). Simulation allows researchers\nto conduct computer-based experiments to evaluate their hypotheses in the\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

While experimentation is critical, the ability also clearly\nand effectively to communicate and reproduce research is an important benefit\nof simulation modeling. In this regard, executability is important, as this may\nbecome an important advantage for communicating ideas by bringing them to\nlife in a virtual world and make scholars and students experience it.\nMany simulation pioneers successfully demonstrated the power of simula-\ntion, among those Axelrod\u2019s paper \u201cAdvancing the art of simulation in the social\nsciences\u201d (1997). However, to this day the use of simulation-based solutions in\nsocial sciences and the humanities is often overshadowed by the lack of com-\nprehensibility, shareability, and reproducibility, which led to recent activities in\nprofessional societies to address these concerns by encouraging researchers to\nshare simulations used to produce insights presented in journal papers, as dis-\ncussed by Uhrmacher et al. (2016). The general question is: how can we share\nour assumptions and constraints within our modeling efforts with other com-\nputational scientists?\nThe following criteria were identified as tenets for useful modeling in social\nsciences during the expert discussions at the RAND workshop in support of\nDARPA in Spring 2017. Models are mainly used to communicate ideas and may\neventually lead to a computational representation of laws of social science that\ncan be extracted from peer-reviewed work. As such, visualization and other\nrepresentations of these laws and their effects that integrate all team members,\nincluding the customer and sponsor of the work, into the modeling process are\nas important as mathematically consistent representation. The resulting mod-\nels must be understandable, reproducible, replicable, reusable, and credible.\nModels developed by computational social sciences shall ultimately be used to\ncommunicate and archive the social science body of knowledge in computably\naccessible and executable form.\nWithin this chapter, we will first address the philosophical foundations for\nmodel-based science and their applicability for the various schools of social\nscience. We will then present a set of selected modeling methods, well know-\ning that such a list can neither be complete nor exclusive. It is also likely that\ncomputational social scientists will need to use a set of orchestrated tools and\ndata, such as recommended, among others, by Levis (2016). The use of mod-\nels and simulations within social science leads to a recommended way for-\nward. Within all of this, the focus lies on using models to document knowledge\nand research and communicate it unambiguously with other members of the\nbroader research community.\nPhilosophical Foundations\nModeling in Support of Scientific Work\nIn the Introduction, we already stated that models can be seen to be the essence\nof science. According to Rosen (1998), modeling is the essence of scienceDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nPhilosophical Foundations 547\nand the habitat of all epistemology! In his method on the physical sciences,\nJohn Von Neumann (1955) states that \u201csciences do not try to explain, they\nhardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models.\u201d This statement is surely\nmeant to emphasize the importance of models to communicate insights, as in\nparticular in the inductive\u2013empirical world, we make real-world predictions\nrooted in experience captured in models. However, is such a euphoric view\nof models applicable to computational social sciences as well, as they are\nmore often represented by the deductive\u2013rational view of the world? Since\nSir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) introduced the inductive\u2013empirical method,\naccompanied by Rene Descartes (1596\u20131650) introducing the deductive\u2013\nrational method, we perceive ourselves applying the scientific method to gain\nknowledge. The inductive\u2013empirical method evolved into scientific realism,\nwhile the deductive\u2013rational method can be interpreted as the foundation for\nthe development of constructionist views.\nPhilosophers of science contributed many directly related insights in recent\npublications that all support the role of models and increasingly the role of\nsimulation, in support of scientific work. Gelfert (2016) compiled an overview\nof philosophical views on the use of models in science. Magnani and Casa-\ndio (2016) provided an overview of model-based reasoning research, followed\nby Magnani and Bertolotti (2017) compilation of model-based science, both\nwritten from the perspective of humanities and philosophy. Humphreys (2004)\nprovided a philosopher\u2019s perspective on how modeling and simulation can fit\ninto the philosophy of science. If our models represent the objective knowl-\nedge sufficiently, they can be used to extend our abilities to take full advantage\nof computational benefits. Like we use microscopes and telescopes to extend\nthe ability of our visual abilities, simulations help us to extend our mathemat-\nical skills to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems. Provid-\ning a simulationist\u2019s viewpoint was attempted by Tolk (2015), similarly making\nthe point that if we have a theory, understood as the collection and consistent\nrepresentation of guiding laws of the discipline, a valid model represents this\ntheory, and the resulting verified simulation system can now be used to gain\ninsight into the represented system, produce quasi-empirical data to spawn fur-\nther research, and so forth. Validity in this context means alignment with the\ntheory, and verification ensures the lossless transformation of the model into\ncomputer code.\nGelfert (2016) closes his evaluation on the scientific use of models from the\nphilosophical perspective with the following conclusion.\nWhereas the heterogeneity of models in science and the diversity of their\nuses and functions are nowadays widely acknowledged, what has per-\nhaps been overlooked is that not only do models come in various forms\nand shapes and may be used for all sorts of purposes, but they also give\nunity to this diversity by mediating not just between theory and data, but\nalso between the different kinds of relations into which we enter with\nthe world. Models, then, are not simply neutral tools that we use at willDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In summary, the case for model-based science to\ncapture knowledge in comprehensible, shareable, and reproducible form has\nbeen established. Representing our concepts and understanding about their\nrelations and behavior in a form that allows gaining more knowledge in the\nform of models has been argued for from different philosophical standpoints.\nThis small literature research, which can neither be complete nor exclusive,\nmotivates that models seem to be the best option to enable translational social\nsciences.\nEpistemological Constraints for Computational Science\nComputational sciences use their models to develop simulation systems that\nhelp to conduct simulation-based experiments. Whenever a real-world exper-\niment is too expensive, is too dangerous, or simply cannot be conducted due\nto the absence of necessary components, such as systems that are still under\ndevelopment, such simulation-based experiments can help to gain insight even\nin the absence of empirical experiments.\nKleijnen (2008), Law (2014), and Zeigler et al. (2000) agreed on the basic prin-\nciple that in a simulation-based experiment, the system of interest is replaced\nby a valid simulation thereof, which means that by variation of the free input\nparameters and observation of the same bound input parameters, the same out-\nput parameters with the same temporal behavior should be observed as if the\nexperiment were conducted with the real system. An experimental frame binds\nthe overall system, sufficient parametric variations allow for a good understand-\ning of solutions and their sensitivity, and uncertainty can be captured by choos-\ning and calibrating the appropriate probability functions. Traor\u00e9 and Muzy\n(2006) showed the duality of experiment frame and simulation system.\nThe experimental frame is sometimes compared with the experimental\nsetting used to exclude unwanted influences from the natural setting, but\nepistemologically, there is a significant difference, as the experimental frame\nbounds the reality to what is known of the simulation, while the experimen-\ntal settings simply exclude known but unwanted influences. A real-world\nexperiment can reveal something we do not know, while a simulation system\ncan only reveal what we already know. As captured by Chaitin (1977), com-\nputer programs including simulation systems are purely transformational;\nthey simply map input parameters to output parameters using computableDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nPhilosophical Foundations 549\nfunctions. Whatever we find in the output parameters has either been in the\nprogram or in the input parameters. Nothing new is created in this process;\ninformation is simply transformed.\nOn the other side, recent success stories have demonstrated that compu-\ntational sciences are a powerful tool that allow evaluation of a scientific the-\nory in a detail that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be possible, by scanning through vast\nregions of the solution space by sheer computing power. Ken Wilson\u2019s discover-\nies about phase changes in materials using simulation earned him a Nobel Prize\nin physics (Wilson 1989). Another recent example is the discovery of the Higgs\nboson elementary particle (Atlas Collaboration 2012) in which simulation was\nsuccessfully used to guide experiments to allow for successful observations. The\nsimulation comprised all aspects of the guiding theory and therefore could help\nto look exactly where the theory predicted certain events to occur so that the\nscientists could focus their observations of the real world accordingly.\nIt is, therefore, interesting to focus on the epistemologically interesting char-\nacteristics of a model. As compiled in Tolk (2015), modeling is a task-driven\npurposeful simplification and abstraction of a perception of reality. Let\u2019s have a\ncloser look at the components of this definition:\n\u2022 Task-driven: A model is generated for a task. It is built to help look for an\nanswer to a scientific question, or it may be built to construct a simulation\nsystem that helps to extract information from users. A serious game may be\nrequired to educate people or just to provide an immersive virtual environ-\nment in which individuals can react and be observed without any risks. The\ntask drives the modeling process.\n\u2022 Purposeful: Modeling is a creative act. The various activities are focused and\ndetermined by the task to be supported.\n\u2022 Simplification: Like the experimental settings eliminate all unwanted influ-\nences, simplification eliminates all elements that are not important and only\ndistract from the main event. Only what is necessary for the task becomes\npart of the model.\n\u2022 Abstraction: Abstraction levels are often used to hide details in support of\nfocusing on particular concerns that do not require knowledge about the\nunderlying details. Complex systems may expose different characteristics on\na micro, meso, and macro level, the methods of applied sociology that may be\nused are usually influenced by comparable levels, and therefore such focus on\nlevel-specific concerns and methods is important for the modeling process\nas well.\n\u2022 Reality: The model shall be rooted in empirical data, observations, or logical\nextensions of valid theories. As discussed before, this can be simplified and\nabstracted, but the real world builds the foundation of the model.\n\u2022 Perception: The perception of reality is shaped by physical\u2013cognitive aspects\nas well as other constraints. It represents our current understanding ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n550 Representing Socio-Behavioral Understanding with Models\nthe problem. The physical aspect defines what attributes of an object are\nobservable with the sensory system of the observer or, more generally, the\ninformation about the object that can be obtained. Cognitive aspects are\nshaped by the education and knowledge of the observer, their paradigms,\nand even knowledge of related tools associated with the tasks. Additional\nconstraints are legal or ethical borders that cannot be crossed when collect-\ning data needed for the modeling process. Social factors play a critical role\nas well.\nThe result of the modeling phase is a conceptualization. This conceptualization\nis then transformed over several steps into an executable simulation. This trans-\nformation process is also shaped significantly by the resources and abilities of\nthe programmers. Are memory and processing capacities sufficient, is the pro-\ngramming language expressive enough, are numerical approximations needed,\nand does computational complexity require the use of heuristics instead of for-\nmal solutions? Oberkampf et al. (2002) compiled a list of such transformation\nand implementation challenges that result in errors and uncertainties in simu-\nlation experiments.\nThese mathematical, computational, and epistemological challenges are sys-\ntemic. Honest and extensive documentation of assumptions, constraints, and\napplied heuristics and numerical approximations are pivotal to understanding\nsimulation results as well as for providing for reproducibility, reuse, and com-\nmon research. Modeling methods and paradigms can help to accomplish this\ngoal. From the broader philosophy of science perspective, these results are con-\nsistent with the insights provided by McKelvey (1997, 2002).\nFurthermore, models \u2013 by their very own definition \u2013 are providing a facet\nof our understanding. Some models are unifying, while others are focusing\non a special effect of particular interest. If we want to use them to capture our\nknowledge in total, we have to make sure that the models \u2013 and the resulting\nsimulations \u2013 can work together. The insights from the field of semiotics can\nbe of tremendous help, as semiotics deals with signs and symbols, their use,\nand interpretations, up to the definition of artificial and natural languages. The\nvarious ideas have been compiled by Tolk et al. (2012) regarding modeling and\nsimulation, showing a close relationship between these approaches. Semiotics\ndifferentiates between the syntax (how to provide information structurally), the\nsemantics (how to interpret the provided information), and pragmatics (how\nto use this information). Similarly, the underlying technical standards define\nhow information is structured in a simulation system, the data or object model\nprovides the interpretation, and the procedures of the simulation system show\nhow this information is used. System engineers may recognize the similarity\nto the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom hierarchy made popular\nby Ackoff (1989): data are facts, close to syntax, that become information\nwhen put into a common context, giving facts meaning, so belonging to theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Organizing the dynamics of information and processing,\nit creates knowledge, a pragmatic process. The level of wisdom addresses why\ncertain knowledge is used, adding a level that represents the scientific theory\nthat is used to describe, analyze, and structure the know-what and know-how\nof the lower three levels into the know-why. All these levels are needed when\nwe bring models together into a common knowledge repository. If the data are\nnot aligned, the processes not harmonized, and the theories not consistent, the\nresult of using two models may offer little scientific value. If the models and\nsimulations are working together, the scientific support can be tremendous, as\nalready mentioned by pointing to Wilson (1989) and the Atlas Collaboration\n(2012).\nHowever, models are a perception of reality, representing a theory of causal-\nity that explains observable correlation in empirical observations (or success-\nfully predicting such observations). As such, models ideally reflect our current\nbest knowledge to explain phenomena. Like theories, as described by Goldman\n(2006), different models can make different predictions.\nTwo challenges tightly related with the use of simulation are epistemological\nand hermeneutical in nature. Scientists make an epistemological mistake when\nthey do not model some phenomenon important for the topic of interest, as\ndiscussed above. Hermeneutical mistakes interpret something into simulation\nresults that is not included in the model: scientists unconsciously project\ntheir worldview into the observed results, which are potentially biased. In\nsummary, not modeling what is important is an epistemological challenge,\nwhile interpreting something into the model that is not in it is a hermeneutical\nchallenge.\nTolk et al. (2013) provided a framework that treats different models as dif-\nferent viewpoints. In highly dynamic systems, such predictions can differ sig-\nnificantly, as is well known from weather models. Providing a common context\nthat allows the display of various forecasts side by side is a useful tool. If, in\naddition, the different level of trust in certain models is considered, based on\nexperience or scientific rigor of the model, powerful decision support can be\nprovided. However, models must be placed into a common context, and that\ncan be a challenge by itself, in particular, when the originating disciplines use\ndifferent terms and concepts to express their theories. The next section will\npresent some methods to support overcoming these challenges.\nMulti-, Inter-, and Transdisciplinary Research\nThe terms multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary are often used interchangeably\nby researchers not used to working in such a diverse collection of domains, but\nthey define distinct phases and degrees of alignment of collaboration between\ntwo fields. Before addressing this, it is worthwhile to address why so many dif-\nferent disciplines with special concepts and terms exist in the first place.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The main underlying idea is first to formu-\nlate a hypothesis, then define an experimental frame to support an experiment\nthat allows validation or falsification of the hypothesis. In the case of success,\nintegrate the hypothesis as a new component into the existing theory, or if the\nnew results falsify the current theory, formulate a new theory that combines\nold and new research insights consistently. The guiding principle is reduction-\nism, derived from the principle of noncontradiction, which allows a researcher\nto divide all objects into sets defined by the presence or absence of a character-\nistic attribute. We can divide the whole knowledge domain into various fields\nand subfields, leading to more and more specialized experts in disciplines that\nare well defined by the subset of knowledge they are working on. Reductionism\nhas been very successful in understanding more and more detail, for example,\nin the domain of molecular biology or particle physics.\nHowever, in recent decades, the need for systems thinking and holistic\napproaches arose from understanding complexity and complex systems better.\nIn complex systems, the principle that \u201cthe system is more than the sum of\nits parts\u201d requires an additional understanding of the interrelations between\nthe components, which are well understood by the specialist. Complexity\ndoes not replace reductionism but adds additional value to the relation and\ninteractivities of components. The highly specific and detailed understanding\nof the fields is still needed, but the seams between these fields and subfields are\nshifting into the focus of scientific interest as well, requiring a collaboration\nof researchers that traditionally did not collaborate, leading to multi-, inter-,\nand transdisciplinary research. The taxonomy and definitions published by\nKlein (2010) clarify the different degrees of collaboration between different\ndisciplines to address such new challenges.\n\u2022 Multidisciplinarity describes a loose and temporary coupling of disciplines\nto solve a common problem. It juxtaposes disciplines and their methods. The\nmultidisciplinary team coordinates and sequences their contributions, com-\nplementing each other. The definition of terms is aligned with a focus on the\ncollaborative effort, the information exchange is an ad hoc established by the\nteam.\n\u2022 Interdisciplinarity creates a closer linkage between disciplines. Data are\naligned and processes are orchestrated, supporting a much higher degree of\nan integrating approach. The interdisciplinary team focuses on identifying\noverlapping domains of knowledge and uses integrated solutions in its\nparticipating disciplines. By doing so, they are building permanent bridges\nthat link domains together. In addition to the research results, common\nconcepts and common semantics of terms are established that become part\nof the originating disciplines.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Tran-\nscending, transgressing, and transforming the disciplines and specialties\ndefines this approach. Concepts, terms, and activities are not only described\nin common terms but also systematically integrated, and new interactions\nare defined across the sectors of original contributions. While knowledge\ncomponents are used to complement each other in multidisciplinary teams,\ntransdisciplinarity hybridizes the knowledge. 1\nThe following figure was developed for the medical community to show\nnot only the need for striving for higher degrees of collaboration, using\nthe definitions of Klein (2010), but also the necessary alignment of meth-\nods from M&S needed to allow such degrees of collaboration (Tolk 2016)\n(Figure 23.1).\nThe simulation-based support must allow for such collaboration and there-\nfore needs to advance integratability, interoperability, and composability as\nwell. A recent compilation of related work and definitions has been published\nin Benali and Ben Saoud (2011). More related work can be found in the recent\nNSF report (Fujimoto et al. 2017). As no single model can provide all the\nfunctionality needed and facets required to understand a certain research\nchallenge, we will always have to use an orchestrated set of tools, using\ndifferent methods, modeling paradigms, etc.\n\u2022 To support data exchange between supporting simulation methods in multi-\ndisciplinary approaches, ad hoc agreements are established to ensure the cor-\nrect interpretation and use of data. Besides using fundamental agreements\nabout the supporting infrastructures providing a common syntax to describe\ndata and common technical means to exchange them, there is no need for\nfurther alignment. In the extreme, swivel chair solutions \u2013 where the experts\nof one discipline must re-encode the results in a usable form for their simu-\nlation method \u2013 can and will be applied.\n\u2022 The more persistent interdisciplinary team will establish interoperability\nsolutions that use the team agreement resulting from their integrating and\ninteracting collaboration: the alignment of data and the orchestration of\nprocesses. Interoperability allows the exchange of data and their use in the\nreceiving systems of the interdisciplinary team.\n\u2022 Transdisciplinary teams ultimately create a coherent theory that results from\nthe transcending, transgressing, and transforming collaboration. Not only\ndoes this allow for the exchange of data and their use, but it also ensures the\nconsistent representation of truth in accordance with the common theory in\nall participation systems.\n1 While most researcher distinguish between multi- and interdisciplinary approaches, the\ndifferentiation between inter- and transdisciplinary approaches is sometimes omitted.

Interdisciplinarity\nrequires interoperable simulation solutions, allowing the exchange of data and\nmeaningful use of data in the receiving systems, based on common semantics\nand pragmatics. Transdisciplinarity uses composable simulation solutions\nthat are not only interoperable but also supportive of a common theory and\ntherefore ensure the common representation of truth in all participating\nsystems.\nWhen selecting modeling methods, as discussed in the next section, these\nguiding ontological and epistemological principles need to be taken into con-\nsideration to ensure the best possible support of computational social science\nby simulation-based solutions.\nSimulation and Modeling Approaches\nfor Computational Social Scientists\nUsing simulations becomes a more commonly accepted method to advance\nsocial science. In addition to the general ontological and epistemological\nprinciples, social scientists must also understand the concrete contributions\nand limitations of the diverse array of the available modeling and simulation\napproaches. Like the social systems under study, simulation methodologies\nvary widely. By employing simulations from different perspectives, we can\nbuild a more complete understanding of complex social systems. To advance\ncomputational social science, researchers must build an appreciation of these\nperspectives to ensure that the simulation approach employed will contribute\ntoward building a deeper understanding of a system, be that through inductive,\ndeductive, or even a generative logical approach. As researchers apply these\nmethodologies, they must do so in a way that ensures replicability, ease of\nsharing, and ease of understanding.\nThere are multiple ways that simulations can advance our understanding\nof social systems, employing deduction (derived from principles), abduction\n(through observation with probabilistic inference), and even induction (obser-\nvations leading to principles). We can use them in an exploratory fashion\nto explore the implications of social structures and incentives by generating\nobserved behaviors (simulation of social systems); we can also use them as\ntools to gather data from individuals and organizations that would be too\ndifficult, dangerous, or costly to obtain directly, such as in combat or policy\nsimulations (simulation for social systems).\nHumans can be in the loop, interacting with a simulation, or the simulation\ncan exist in a standalone constructive environment. We can simulate behaviors\nwith a paucity of data such as the collapse of the Anasazi culture 800 years ago\nby searching for rules that can generate observed behavior (Epstein 2006), or weDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The space of possible applications of simulation in social\nscience is extensive. Rather than cataloguing every possible application, it is\nuseful to examine the broader classes and approaches of simulation to social\nand behavioral sciences. We also refer to more detailed publications for further\nevaluation, such as Diallo et al. (2019) providing examples and perspectives\nfrom social science and the humanities and obviously several chapters in this\nvolume.\nSimulation OF Social Systems\nPerhaps the most common way in which simulation is employed is the simula-\ntion of social systems, when social systems are modeled, simulated, and stud-\nied. This typically follows a deductive approach, where the simulation is used as\na tool to explore the logical implications of rules and structures, based on gen-\neral principles. This allows researchers to understand how different structures,\nincentives, and neurocognitive models may generate previously observed social\nbehaviors and provide a testbed to study how intervention can alter behav-\nior. The benefits of such an approach are many: reduced cost, faster analysis,\ncleaner data, greater controllability, and the ability to simulate situations that\nare too difficult to study in real-world systems. The primary challenge, how-\never, is validity: real-world social systems are extremely complex, and we have\nno laws governing social interaction in the way that we have laws for thermo-\ndynamics. While we may be far away from being able to describe laws of social\nphysics in the way we have for the physics of motion, simulation of social sys-\ntems can still prove to be very valuable in accelerating our understanding and\nencourage social science researchers to describe their theories with the rigor\nnecessary for computational examination.\nIn modeling physical systems, such as an aircraft, we employ a deductive\napproach: based on our understanding of aerodynamics, we can use simulation\nto understand how a new aircraft design will behave, and we can have confi-\ndence that our simulated aircraft will perform favorably to the actual aircraft.\nIn social systems, our understanding of basic principles is less developed. We\nhave not advanced our theories of social systems such that our understanding of\norganizational dynamics allows us to simulate a new organizational design and\npredict its performance with reasonable confidence. We can, however, create\nhigher-level models driven by causal logic as tools to advance our understand-\ning of such systems. Such top-down approaches help us to better create and\nshape social systems, even if they are sufficiently abstract that they miss many\nof the emergent phenomena, heterogeneity, and other complexities that char-\nacterize social systems. Another approach that can be taken to build our under-\nstanding is to replicate behavior seen in practice by generating it from low-levelDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This bottom-up approach to the-\nory development shows tremendous promise in fundamentally advancing our\ntheoretical understanding of social and behavioral systems, yet produces many\nchallenges that researchers continue to struggle with. Both perspectives of sim-\nulations of social systems provide value.\nSimulation of Social Systems from the Top Down\nThe oldest approaches to social system simulation are equation-based\napproaches, which model the dynamics of social systems in terms of differ-\nential or difference equations. By necessity of the approach, such modeling is\ndone at a very high level, and the structure of the system is determined from\nthe top down. Individuals are not modeled; rather, it is aggregates and rates\nthat are modeled in an attempt to understand how quantities change over time\nas a result of feedback and interaction.\nOne such early application was the Lanchester equations, first developed in\n1916 to model losses in combat between two forces (Lanchester 1956). These\nequations describing the modern warfare are very simple and can be given as\ndA\ndt = \u2212 \ud835\udefdB\ndB\ndt = \u2212 \ud835\udefcA\nwhere A is the initial number of soldiers in one force, B is the initial number of\nsoldiers in a second force, and \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd are the respective rates at which each\nforce can eliminate the other force per unit of time. This model, simple enough\nto be solved by hand, helped strategists and historians understand the trade-offs\nbetween numerical advantage and technical superiority, but did so by treating a\nsocial system as a physical system, no different than water moving between two\ncontainers. The mathematical formalism of such models meant that they were\nnot commonly used in the social sciences, as they were seen as unapproachable\nand unintuitive to the social sciences.\nBeginning in the 1950s, Jay Forrester at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-\nnology (MIT) began to develop a methodology called system dynamics to apply\nand teach a differential equations approach to modeling using a graphical nota-\ntion that could be easily taught to students without a rigorous mathematical\nbackground. These diagrams of stocks and flows could be translated into dif-\nferential equations and then solved using computers. Using system dynam-\nics, Forrester and his students began applying the technique first to industrial\ndynamics and then later to social issues such as social policy in urban areas\n(Forrester 1969) and even limits to global growth using the World 3 model\n(Meadows et al. 1972).\nThis simulation approach first defines the structure of systems, with feed-\nback and delays, and produces dynamic behavior. This structure was developedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n558 Representing Socio-Behavioral Understanding with Models\nbased upon a causal hypothesis: component A\u2019s increase causes component B\u2019s\ndecrease. This structure-driven, continuous time approach meant that it was\nnot individuals that were modeled, but rather aggregates behaving in deter-\nministic response to a designed, but complex, system. This is the essence of a\ntop-down approach, which provides insights into the theoretical performance\nof idealized social (and other) systems in which actors behave identically and\nthe data that drive the system are population averages, rather than heteroge-\nneous, path-dependent characteristics of individuals. The goal of such models\nis to identify and quantify policy levers in a system that can influence behav-\nior, such as housing policies or growth targets. Critiques (Nordhaus 1973) of\nthe World 3 model and the accompanying book Limits to Growth (Meadows\net al. 1972) slowed the widespread adoption of this approach in the social sci-\nences, although it did develop a following in the study of business strategy and\nconsulting (Senge 1990; Sterman 2000).\nTop-down simulation approaches, such as system dynamics or other\nequation-based approaches, can be very useful in developing understanding\nin idealized, and designed, systems. They can often be developed rapidly, the\ncausal nature of the underlying logic is unambiguous and easily communi-\ncated, and the models themselves are straightforward to rigorously analyze\n(Rahmandad et al. 2015). These models, however, are highly abstracted and\nfundamentally do not model the behavior of individuals, the basis of social\nsystems. Any social theory based upon individual behaviors, preferences, het-\nerogeneity, time history, or even position cannot be evaluated using top-down\napproaches without significant effort. In such examples, another approach is\nbetter suited.\nSimulation of Social Systems from the Bottom Up\nIn contrast to the top-down approach where the top-level structure is modeled\nand behavior is simulated in the aggregate, bottom-up simulation of social\nsystems seeks to understand how social behavior emerges from micro-level\ninteractions. The unit of analysis is the individual and the individuals\u2019 incen-\ntives, rather than the high-level structure of the systems. Microsimulation,\nmulti-agent simulation, individual-based models, and agent-based models are\nrelated simulation approaches that follow the bottom-up modeling paradigm.\nDue to its ability to generate behaviors that are observable at multiple scales and\ngreat flexibility, the bottom-up approach to simulation, and specifically agent-\nbased modeling, is the most widely used simulation approach in social and\nbehavioral research (Boero 2015). Advances in the field are enabling researchers\nto better communicate and build upon each other\u2019s work.\nOne of the earliest explorations of bottom-up approach to modeling a social\nsystem was done manually by Schelling (1969), who employed coins on a paper\ngrid to model to study segregation. Schelling defined a set of rules to govern if\na given coin would choose to move to an unoccupied square based on the colorDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In this way,\nhe established how \u201cmicromotives can drive macrobehaviors\u201d (Schelling 1978).\nThere was no central structure; system-level behavior was shown to emerge\nfrom interactions of individuals obeying local incentives in response to their\nenvironment. This approach to modeling did not capture a specific neighbor-\nhood or attempt to make forecasts, but rather sought to help researchers posit\nrules and incentives and then see and observe what behavior would emerge if\nall actors exactly obeyed accordingly.\nThe structure of Schelling\u2019s model made it amenable to simulation and others\nin many disciplines such as ecology and began to employ computer simula-\ntion to study how individual-level modeling could give rise to system behavior.\nSimulation tools such as StarLogo, Swarm, and NetLogo began to appear in\nthe 1990s, enabling researchers in fields ranging from physics to ecology to\nbuild bottom-up models without developing them from scratch. Bonnabeau\n(2002) provided an excellent overview of the development of the tools and early\napplications, which often sought to explore the implications on how a globally\nshared set of incentives and behaviors could give rise to system-level behav-\nior and patterns. Bottom-up simulations in which the agents are homogeneous\ncan be made to very closely approximate top-down simulations, especially as\nthe number of agents increases (Borschsev and Fillipov 2004).\nWhile there is value in simulations that demonstrate how patterns emerge\nfrom a given rule set with homogeneous agents, many researchers desired to\nadvance the autonomy and heterogeneity of their agents in ways that reflect\nthe real world, employing bounded rationality, realistic interactions, and net-\nworks and placing them in an explicit space. As these models include more of\nthese attributes, they gain the ability to explore a greater number of dynamics.\nModels possessing these attributes are called agent-based models to distinguish\nthem from the more simplistic, mechanistic approaches that might be termed\nmicrosimulations or simply multi-agent systems.\nEpstein and Axtell (1996) were early and vocal proponents of agent-based\nmodels in the social science, and Epstein (2006) went on to develop the case\nthat ABM represents a new approach, which he termed generative, to conduct-\ning social science research. The accepted standard of scientific explanation in\nthe social science, he argues, should be the ability to generate observed behav-\niors. The generative standard, with the motto \u201cif you didn\u2019t grow it, you didn\u2019t\nexplain it,\u201d employs an empirical, deductive approach based upon available data\nabout a social system. Generating behavior in a social system, Epstein argues,\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition for explanation is social systems.\nBuilding upon the Sugarscape model (Epstein and Axtell 1996), the Artificial\nAnasazi project (Epstein 2006) demonstrated how an agent-based model could\nexplain how the indigenous population of the Long House Valley in north-\neastern Arizona between 800 and 1350 CE. adapted its behaviors in responseDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Using the climatic record and developing decision\nrules for agents in conjunction with anthropologists, the model could generate\npatterns of behavior consistent with the archaeological record.\nA difficult aspect of bottom-up modeling approaches is developing decision\nand interaction rules for agents. These are often developed through observa-\ntion and iteration, and it has often been observed that even simple rules can\ngive rise to complex behavior. An early model of flocking in birds, for example,\nproduced strikingly familiar patterns of behavior using only three simple rules\nfor the motion of birds in a flock (Reynolds 1987). These rules were written by\na computer scientist looking to build a convincing animation, however, not a\nbiologist looking to develop an understanding of starlings. To make computa-\ntional approaches more relevant to the advancement of social science, rather\nthan being an enlightening exercise, the tools for computationally modeling\nsocial systems from the bottom up need a theoretically grounded framework.\nThe eternal blank canvas for the computational researcher, even if it can gener-\nate familiar behaviors, will not become a primary tool of social scientists until\nit can incorporate and extend existing theory.\nThe current frontier in bottom-up simulation of social systems is in develop-\ning frameworks built on existing social science theory that are understandable\nto social scientists while still providing the experimental flexibility of simula-\ntion. Rather than using perfectly rational and consistent agents whose behav-\nior seeks a mathematically desirable equilibrium, the frontier seeks to develop\nframeworks to generate behaviors with boundedly rational agents. For example,\nThompson et al. (2017) sought to operationalize the theory of planned behavior\n(Ajzen 1991), which describes how individual beliefs and norms drive behavior\nas it relates to participating in government. The challenge lies in translating a\ncausal hypothesis from the social science literature into the precise mathemat-\nical language of simulations.\nEpstein ambitiously sought to move the field forward by developing such a\nframework called Agent_Zero, which he developed to provide neurocognitive\nbasis for agent-based models (2013). The Agent_Zero framework posits that\nindividual behavior in groups is driven by three partially understood and\ninterdependent processes: the emotional, cognitive, and social. The goal of\nsuch a framework was to be able to generate original behaviors in populations\nof cognitive plausible agents that are able to do more than mimic and propa-\ngate behavior, generating phenomena such as collective violence and financial\npanic. This framework draws upon research from cognitive neuroscience but\nhas been developed explicitly for the development of agent-based models.\nWhile Epstein has demonstrated a handful of simulations covering topics from\nthe outbreak of the Arab Spring in 2011 to jury processes using Agent_Zero,\nthe development of new social science theory arising from this framework\nhas yet to be seen. There is active effort underway to continue to advance the\nframework and for others to apply it in useful ways that can contribute towardDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Rather than a computational exercise where all\naspects exist in silico and the full experiment can be easily shared, simulations\nfor social systems seek to immerse human subjects in simulated, virtual envi-\nronments so that their interaction with the simulation and each other can be\nstudied. These human-in-the-loop simulations can control for factors that are\noften too difficult, costly, or otherwise untenable to experiment with directly.\nFor example, a flight simulator is a human-in-the-loop simulation often used\nto train pilots at significantly reduced cost, placing them in otherwise danger-\nous scenarios. Such simulations, when used for research rather than training\ncan be highly effective at generating responses from users that are reflective of\nreal-world behaviors.\nIn research with human-in-the-loop simulation, the human contribution is\nobserved, rather than modeled as it is in simulations of social systems. Applica-\ntions can vary widely, ranging from studying individual cognition and response\nin virtual environments to more socially oriented simulation on topics such\nas war gaming (Harrigan and Kirschenbaum 2016), command and control, or\npolicy development (Mayer 2009). Rothcock and Narayanan (2011) provided\na recent overview of many uses of human-in-the-loop simulation for research\non human interactions in simulated contexts, examining human involvement in\ncomplex systems, and the study of cognitive models. When used for research,\nthese simulations provide a testbed for experimentation that researchers can\nuse as the basis for hypothesis development and validation.\nThe military community refers to such a mix of human-in-the-loop simu-\nlation approaches as live-virtual-constructive simulation: in live simulations,\nreal humans operate real systems in a maneuver; in virtual simulations, real\nhumans operate simulated systems or simulator; and in constructive simula-\ntions, simulated humans operate simulated systems (Hodson and Hill 2014).\nWhile the technical challenges of such compositions are well addressed, much\nresearch still needs to be conducted on effectiveness of the resulting training\nand the transferability of experiments from the virtual to the real world, as\nthe validity and transferability are often limited by the behavior pattern of\nhumans, which may be different if they know that they are acting in the real or\na simulated world.\nSimulation for social systems, such as human-in-the-loop simulations, is\ndistinct from simulation of social systems, such as agent-based modeling,\nin that it represents an experimental platform to collect data from humanDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While it does capture the behavior of actual humans in a controlled\nenvironment, it does not provide the same benefits of cleanly articulating,\ndocumenting, and sharing repeatable research across the social science\nresearch community as is needed to advance the field of social science. There\nis a need for both approaches, however, as we do not yet have accurate,\npredictive, and theoretically grounded simulation models of individual behav-\nior (as Agent_Zero aspires to provide a framework for) that are needed for\nsimulations of social systems. We will continue to need to experiment with\nand understand individuals, so that we can build more accurate, testable, and\nconstructive simulations of social structures and dynamics.\nThe Way Forward\nThe examples have shown that there is a growing place for simulation solu-\ntions and applications in computational social science and that models and\nsimulations are significant contributions to the body of knowledge. To take\nfull advantage of the potential use of model-based knowledge representations,\nthese models must be conceptually aligned, as described for transdisci-\nplinary research. These activities foremost not only support reaching the\nobjectives of comprehensibility, shareability, and reproducibility of research\nand results but also support the direct use of computational support by the\nresulting simulations, as competing theories are recognized on the conceptual\nlevel, so researchers know that they should use the resulting simulation to\nevaluate competing alternatives, and common theories allow for the devel-\nopment of model compositions with complementary views provided by the\nsimulations.\nCompeting and complementing simulation compositions can be understood\nas the foundation of computational social science, as these simulation systems\nare developed to replace observed empirical correlations or assumed theoretic\nassumptions with causality: implemented as functions on input domain and\nresulting in output ranges! The computational representation makes them pre-\ncise, the use of modeling methods as discussed in the previous sections makes\nthem communicable, and their implementation as a simulation makes them\neasily reproducible. This requires a solid understanding of the various mod-\neling paradigms and their application potential and constraints, mathemati-\ncally, epistemologically, and hermeneutically. There is a rising interest in topics\non simulation solutions in support of social science, as books like Gilbert and\nTroitzsch (2005), Conte et al. (2013), and Diallo et al. (2019) show.\nDespite all these advantages, Denning (2017) provided a critical review of\ncomputational thinking, warning against overselling the ideas when claimingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

To take full benefit of the\nadvantages, he observed that computational thinking includes designing the\nmodel, not just the steps to control it. This can be generalized into the necessity\nto understand fully a model to be able to control it. Otherwise, hermeneuti-\ncal misinterpretations, overselling of results, and other unintended uses of the\ncomputational scientific methods may result. In soft sciences like social sci-\nence and the humanities, the computational support will continue to become\nincreasingly important.\nOn the other side, simulations enabled significant breakthroughs in compu-\ntational sciences, with the already earlier mentioned simulation-supported dis-\ncovery of the Higgs boson elementary particle being one of the most important\nrecent contributions (Atlas Collaboration 2012). In addition, Diallo et al. (2013)\nshowed that simulation can be used not only to simulate known phenomena but\nalso to create insight in the form of building theories in bottom-up approaches,\nhelping to discover new structures of knowledge. While this domain is still in\nits infancy, the application examples clearly show its potential, including for\ncomplex fields like social sciences.\nComputational social science will continue to be one of many contributions\nto the ontology and epistemology of social science. However, to maximize\nthe benefits and support, the principles discussed in this chapter need to\nbe socialized not only in the computational social science community but\nalso in the broader general social science community. This implies the need\nfor easier access to simulation technology for nonengineering disciplines,\nincluding better representation of models, simulations, and their results for the\nnonengineer, as well as openness to such new methods in the social sciences\nand humanities.\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank our many colleagues and friends for their help and input\nin writing this chapter, foremost Saikou Diallo, Jose Padilla, Ernie Page, LeRon\nShults, Brian Tivnan, and Wesley Wildman.\nDisclaimer\nThe authors\u2019 affiliation with The MITRE Corporation is provided for identifica-\ntion purposes only and is not intended to convey or imply MITRE\u2019s concurrence\nwith, or support for, the positions, opinions, or viewpoints expressed by the\nauthor.

These phases include (i) the gener-\nation and prioritizing of modeling assumptions that are ripe for exploration,\n(ii) hypothesis-guided automated generation and execution of experiments\n(Yilmaz et al. 2016, 2017), and (iii) interpretation of results to falsify and revise\ncompeting behavioral mechanisms.\nA critical obstacle includes the disconnect between model discovery and\nexperimentation. Another is the tendency to delay model justification until\nafter model implementation. We conjecture that addressing these issues\nrequires dynamic coupling of model building and experimentation with con-\ntinuous feedback between their technical domains. Coupling these domains\nneeds to provide sound explanatory characterization about what alternative\nand complementary mechanisms are plausible, whether they cohere and\nunder what conditions. This is in contrast with the current practice. Often\nwhen experimental results deviate from expected behavior, modelers locate\nand mitigate the specific issue without looking deeper and more broadly for\nflaws in the model. This leads to premature convergence to a supposedly\ntested model that is not robust enough to address variability and uncertainty.\nHowever, the ability to retain, experiment with, and relate alternative model\nmechanisms is critical for developing robust solutions. This is akin to the issue\nin philosophy of science (Klahr and Simon 1999) of discovering robust theories\n(Levins 1966) that aim to achieve a balance between generality, precision,\ncoherence, and accuracy.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

By using the background knowledge, scientists hypothesize one\nor more models to advance alternate explanations. These hypotheses generate\ntestable predictions, which steer experiments to yield new evidence. The\nobserved data then feed into the process to update causal models, resulting\nin continuous learning that allows adjusting hypothesized mechanisms to\nfit the data better. The premise of the approach is that scientists accept a\ntheory if it provides the best explanation of the expected behavior, where\n\u201cbest explanation\u201d is evaluated based on an overall coherence judgment. In\npractice, actual cases of scientific reasoning (Bunge 1998) suggest a variety of\nfactors that determine the explanatory coherence of hypotheses. How much\ndoes the hypothesis explain? Are its explanations economical? Is the hypothe-\nsis similar to ones that explain similar phenomena? How does the hypothesis\ncompare against alternative hypotheses? Historically, the problem of inference\nto such explanatory hypotheses was explored in philosophy (Bunge 1998),\ncomputational discovery (Darden 2001), psychology (Klahr and Simon 1999),\nand artificial intelligence (Langley 2000). In philosophy, the acceptance of\nexplanatory hypotheses is called inference to the best explanation (Harman\n2008; Thagard 2016).\nMotivated by these observations, the objective of this chapter is to put for-\nward a methodological basis, which aims at the following:\n\u2022 Explore the utility of having a special class of models as adaptive agents that\nmediate among competing domain theories, data, requirements, principles,\nand analogies.\n\u2022 Underline the role of cognitive assistance for model discovery, experimenta-\ntion, and evidence evaluation to discriminate among competing models.\n\u2022 Examine alternative strategies for explanatory justification of plausible solu-\ntions via cognitive models that explicate coherence judgments.\nOur thesis is that model building involves the coherent integration of vari-\nous ingredients (i.e. domain theory, data, requirements, analogies, principles)\nto meet specific quality criteria. This thesis is predicated on two sub-theses:\nthe context of discovery and the context of justification (i.e. related to what\nsome refer to as validation). In the context of discovery, mechanism integra-\ntion plays a vital role in transforming the constituent elements by merging them\ninto a unified mechanism. One aspect of merging is the mechanistic represen-\ntation, while the other is of calibration: the choice of the parameters in such\na way that the model not only fits the data adequately where appropriate but\nalso integrates other ingredients, such as constraints, domain theory, princi-\nples, and analogies. The context of justification refers to built-in justification;\nthat is, when the set of ingredients implement the requirements the model is\nexpected to address, then justification is built in.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In the section \u201cPerspective\nand Challenges,\u201d we characterize a view of models that play the special\nrole of mediating. The perspective is used to illustrate challenges for model\nabstraction and cognitive assistance. The section \u201cA Generic Architecture for\nModels as Cognitive Autonomous Agents\u201d delineates a reference architecture\nthat defines models as mediators, which are construed as cognitive agents. The\nmediation process that cognitive models are designed to carry out is outlined\nin the section \u201cThe Mediation Process.\u201d The section \u201cCoherence-Driven\nCognitive Model of Mediation\u201d presents the role of cognitive computing in\nthe mediation process. The section \u201cConclusions\u201d concludes by summarizing\nthe main contributions of the chapter. Many authors are researching related\nmatters, and the chapter may provide a framework to see how they fit into the\nlarger conceptual architecture.\nPerspective and Challenges\nThe use of models as exploratory instruments that evolve into a plausible\nexplanatory or predictive model suggests that it is reasonable to view a\nparticular class of models as Dynamic Data-Driven Applications (Darema\n2004). Notably, as a mediator between theory and data, the special models in\nquestion need to seek coherence in explanatory causal hypotheses that govern\na model\u2019s behavior.\nModels as Dynamic Data and Theory-Driven Mediating Instruments\nFigure 24.1 illustrates the mediation role of models between theory and data\n(see also Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2018). Theoretical principles are leveraged\nto construct causal relations in the form of behavioral rules. The process\nof simulated experimentation follows the initial construction of the model.\nTargeted instrumentation of the model results in observed simulation data that\nform the basis for learning about the efficacy of the hypothesized mechanistic\nassumptions that define the behavioral rules. The dynamic and mutually\nrecursive feedback between the model and data refers to adaptive learning.\nThe data gathered through experimentation are analyzed to make decisions\nabout model representation. Model revisions, if there is sufficient consensus,\nresult in mechanism revision. Consequently, the theoretical principles induced\nfrom limited data become increasingly accurate in their explanatory and\ngenerative power.\nSimilarly, the Dynamic Data-Driven Application System (DDDAS) paradigm\n(Darema 2004) promotes incorporation of online real-time data into sim-\nulation applications to improve the accuracy of analysis and the precision\nof predictions and controls. As such, DDDAS aims to enhance applicationsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The ability to guide measurement\nand instrumentation processes is critical when the measurement space is\nlarge. By narrowing measurement within a subset of the overall observation\nspace, the methodology reduces both the cost and the time to test while also\nimproving the relevance of data. Viewing coupled model-experiment system\ndynamics as a DDDAS requires advancements in variability management,\nmodel interfaces to instrument the simulation, and facilities to incorporate\ndata-driven inference back into the model\u2019s technical space. As such, the\nprovision of run-time models and dynamic model updating is necessary for\nclosing the loop.\nChallenges\nThe adaptive nature of models highlighted above is consistent with using\n\u201cmodels as mediating instruments\u201d (Morrison and Morgan 1999). According\nto this view, a model needs to align theoretical and empirical constructs to\nconverge to an explanation of expected behavior. The integration of the ingre-\ndients of the model toward aligning theory and data suggests the autonomous\ncharacter of a model, measured as a function of the degree of coherence\nof the competing assumptions, mechanisms, and evidential observations.\nHowever, models should not merely mediate existing theoretical and empirical\nelements. Model developers introduce new features and constructs \u2013 not only\nto represent behavioral mechanisms but also to integrate them in ways that are\nlogical and consistent. Also, to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge, models\nshould be connected with a valid and objective relation to the phenomenaDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Next, we examine\nchallenges in developing model abstractions and cognitive aids to support\ncritical pillars of the perspective outlined.\nModel Abstractions\nComputer simulations have become instruments of epistemic inquiry in a\nwide range of domains spanning from natural to social and artificial sciences\n(Mittal et al. 2017). Further developments in the computational modeling of\nthe information processes that underlie scientific phenomena will require\nadvancements including but not limited to problem formulation, communi-\ncation, and complexity management. Table 24.1 outlines specific categories\nof challenges that need to be addressed to better respond to requirements of\nmodel-driven scientific activities.\nCognitive Assistance in Modeling\nCognitive computing is concerned with computational models and techniques\nthat study the human mind and simulate thought processes (or proxies),\nincluding learning, decision-making, planning, problem-solving, reasoning,\nand explanation. Such cognitive models amplify modelers\u2019 capabilities to\nformulate questions, generate hypotheses, plan and devise experiments, and\nanalyze results to facilitate learning and revision of both the models and\nthe experiments. Hence, a cognitive model is a model that, in the process of\nexperimentation and comparison with data, assists in formulating questions,\ngenerating hypotheses, finding casual relationships, planning and devising\nexperiments, and analyzing results to allow improvement of both models and\nexperiments. To this end, we highlight five significant modes of cognitive\nassistance that can contribute to a model-driven discovery cycle. Support in\nthe form of generative design and execution of experiments as well as model\nsynthesis and revision enables modelers to focus on the objectives of the study\nrather than platform management.\n\u2022 Automation: Orchestrating simulation experiments and collecting data\nrequire transparent access and instrumentation. Experiments should be\ncoupled to the model representation to improve observability while also\nsupporting controllability of simulations. That is, experiments can be\ndefined in a way to facilitate instrumentation and monitoring of simulations\nseamlessly. Aspect-oriented model programming is a potential strategy\nto implement such coupling between models and experiments. The data\ncollected through experimentation need to be abstracted into evidence,\npatterns, and regularities to evaluate hypotheses.

For instance, statistical\nmachine learning techniques can generate causal probabilistic networks\namong hypotheses and evidence to provide a quantitative explanatory\nframework.\n\u2022 Explanation: The output of existing learning techniques is difficult to\ncommunicate to disciplinary scientists and other modelers. Advances in\ncognitive systems are necessary to produce explainable models and present\nresults via an explanation interface, which is ideally guided by cognitive\nand psychological theories of effective explanations. Alternative machine\nlearning models could be developed to learn structured, interpretable,\ncausal models. Moreover, model induction techniques could be used to\ninfer meta-models that provide approximate explainable models of causal\ndependencies among the scientific knowledge structures.\n\u2022 Discovery: Following the analysis of the results, if necessary, mechanistic\nhypotheses could be revised, and these revisions, including new behavioral\nmechanisms, need to be transferred into the model\u2019s technical space to start\na new cycle of experimentation. The revision of experiment models brings\nfocus and generates new plans. Alternative experiment models, guided by\ncurrent goals, could be explored until when new goals emerge due to the\nrevision of hypotheses as well as the availability of new evidence.\nA Generic Architecture for Models as Cognitive\nAutonomous Agents\nAs an active entity, models with cognitive capabilities provide features that\noverlay the simulation model and augment the model to support computational\ndiscovery. In this view, a model is construed as a family of models, which evolve\nas learning takes place. As shown in Figure 24.2, models need to be designed\nwith a variability management layer (VML) to support seamless customization\nand to address a variety of experiment objectives, especially when the target\nsystem has multiple facets (Pohl and Metzger 2006).\nBesides highlighting the significance of a VML, Figure 24.2 illustrates the\nbuilding blocks of an active model that is coupled to an experimentation envi-\nronment to maintain mutually beneficial and adaptive feedback between the-\nory and data.

A family of models is defined in terms\nof features (Kang et al. 2002; Oliveira et al. 2013) that can be configured to\nsynthesize alternative models. Features define mandatory or optional standard\nbuilding blocks of a family of models along with their interrelationships. Vari-\nability management via feature models is a common strategy in the product-line\nengineering practice.\nIn support of such a process, a variability management language should\nenable the specification and weaving of variants in the host simulation mod-\neling language. The selection of such variants in the form of features triggers\nspecific actions that customize a model by adding, removing, or updating\nmodel fragments. For instance, FeatureSim (Yilmaz 2017) is a simulation\nprogramming language that implements the variation management aspect of\nthe reference architecture. The objective of FeatureSim is to provide an agent\nsimulation environment that allows defining agents in terms of reconfigurable\nfeatures. By defining features separately and composing them to build a variety\nof models, experiments can be extended to study the implications of structural\nand behavioral variations. This opens new avenues, relative to common\nsimulation experiments that focus only on sweeping the input parameter space\nof models.\nAs shown in Figure 24.3, a FeatureSim model is encapsulated within an\nexplicit context model, which is constructed by the constraints of the experi-\nment. By making the experiment model a first-class design entity in the overall\narchitecture, simulation model developers are required to explicitly define the\nconstraints under which a model can be explored while making the experiment\nreusable across a family of models. These similar but distinct models can be\ngenerated by updating the resolution model defined as part of the experiment\nmodel. The resolution specification refers to the selected features from the\nfeature model that are pertinent to the simulation experiment. The composer\nevaluates the resolution to synthesize a composite feature that integrates the\nbehaviors associated with the selected features. By varying the resolution\nmodel, the simulation can automatically generate a family of models so that\nthe same experiment can be applied to distinct models.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Moreover, the objective of the experiment dictates\nwhich data sources to monitor to align instrumentation of the model and to\nfacilitate derivation of the dependent variables consistent with the goal of the\nexperiment.\nEnvironment-dependent variation: The behavior of a model depends on the\nindependent variables, factors, and their levels, as well as constraints that\ninfluence the behavior of agents. Such constraints include the structure of\nthe topology that governs interaction among agents and the signals produced\nby the environment. Separation of the environment structure and behav-\nior from the model behavior allows testing of the model under alternative\ninteraction topologies and types of selection pressure induced by the envi-\nronment.\nFeature-dependent variation: Besides parametric variations based on\nenvironment-dependent factors, a model can be configured with alternative\nstructures and behavioral activity flows (mechanisms) to evaluate the\nimplications of different features or rules associated with agents.\nVariable-structure models are necessary to synthesize alternative model\nrepresentations to address different types of research questions or experiment\nobjectives. Unlike the kinds of variation associated with the goal of a simu-\nlation study, which are used to vary the initial context of the model, context-\ndependent run-time variation is based on the recognition of an emergentDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

FeatureSim provides an organizational structure to enable both feature-\ndriven and environment-dependent variation. Feature variation is based on\nfeature modeling strategy, which defines a model in terms features that are\nvisible and prominent behavior, aspect, or quality characteristics of a system.\nExtending variant management to online model tuning to support experi-\nmentation requires a run-time evaluation mechanism. To this end, an input\nplug-in transforms raw experiment data into a format that can be analyzed\nusing the Evaluator/Critic component, shown in Figure 24.2. The evaluator can\nbe as simple as a filter that abstracts the data. However, to provide cognitive\nassistance, a sophisticated model can facilitate coupling a model\u2019s technical\nspace to formal methods such as probabilistic model checking (Kwiatkowska\net al. 2011) to determine the extent to which the simulation data support the\nexpected behavior. Those mechanisms that lend significant support to the\nexpected behavior are retained, while others are revised or declined from\nfurther consideration.\nThe learning model uses the results of the evaluator to update the confidence\nlevels of the competing hypotheses. For example, a Bayesian net can revise con-\nditional posterior probability estimates using the Bayes\u2019 rule in terms of prior\nprobabilities and the observed evidence. Alternatively, cognitive models such as\nexplanatory coherence (Thagard 2016), which is briefly discussed in the section\n\u201cCoherence-Driven Cognitive Model of Mediation,\u201d can be used to acquire,\nmodify, reinforce, or synthesize hypotheses to steer the model-driven discovery\nprocess. This incremental and iterative strategy is coordinated by a mediation\nprocess that governs the interaction between the technical spaces of models\nand experiments. Next, we discuss the elements of such a process.\nThe Mediation Process\nBuilding on (Klahr and Simon 1999), the proposed mediation strategy involves\nthree main components that control the process from the initial formulation of\nhypotheses, through their experimental evaluation, to the decision that there is\nsufficient evidence to accept or reject hypotheses. The three major components\nare search model space, test hypothesis (search experiment space), and evalu-\nate evidence. The output from the Search Model Space component is a set of\nfully specified mechanistic models, which serves as input to the Test Hypothesis\nphase that involves simulated experiments, resulting in evidence for or against\nthe hypothesis. The Evaluate Evidence component decides whether the cumu-\nlative evidence warrants acceptance, rejection, or further consideration of the\ncurrent hypothesis.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In generating model mechanisms,\nstrategies for evoking or inducing a template are needed. Template-based\nfeature-oriented analysis (Meinicke et al. 2016) provides a basis for generative\nmodeling. Specifically, strategies that view models as algebras (Oliveira et al.\n2013) allow flexible composition of models in terms of features. Evoking an\nexisting template requires searching a frame to abstract away unnecessary\nimperative programmatic constructs. In cognitive science, several mechanisms\n(Harman 2008) have been proposed to account for initial templates and to build\nthe search space incrementally. DSL-guided analogical coherence, heuristic\nsearch, and abductive reasoning for evoking mechanisms are plausible strate-\ngies. When it is not possible to reuse a template, a new mechanism can be\nsynthesized in the form of a meta-model by generating expected behavioral out-\ncomes and by generalizing over the results to conjecture a mechanism frame.\nThe second issue that needs to be addressed is the template instantiation\nprocess, which takes as input a partially instantiated mechanism and assigns\nspecific parameter values to generate a fully specified hypothesized model. The-\nory of template-based modeling provides a path for using prior knowledge or\nparticular experimental outcome. If there exist outcomes extracted from pre-\nvious experiments, they can be reused in the new context. Alternatively, the\nGenerate Outcome goal is used to produce empirical results solely to deter-\nmine mechanism parameters via sensitivity and boundary analyses, facilitating\nthe refinement of a partially defined hypothesis. Early in the course of exper-\nimentation, prior knowledge via analogical coherence can be used to assign\nvalues, whereas using experimental outcomes is more likely to be used in the\nlater phases of the iterative discovery process. If all the identified values are\ntried and rejected, then the mechanism needs to be abandoned, and the process\nneeds to trigger the Generate Mechanism goal.\nThe Generate Observation/Outcome goal appears multiple times in the goal\nhierarchy. The first appearance is when simulated outcomes are generated to\ninduce a mechanism template, and the second is when the hypothesized mech-\nanisms are instantiated. Each time the Generate Outcome goal is activated so\nwill the Search Experiment Space goal, which will generate the experiments and\nshould be able to focus on those aspects of the situation that the experiment is\nintended to elucidate. Discriminating among competing mechanisms is one of\nthe critical functions of the Focus subgoal. One can use coherence maximiza-\ntion to address this issue (see the section \u201cCoherence-Driven Cognitive Model\nof Mediation\u201d). Once a focal aspect is identified, the Select Strategy subgoal\ncan choose specific independent and control factors according to the search\npreferences implied by the Focus goal.

The Choose and Set subgoal can assign specific values to\nindependent and control variables to facilitate the application of the Conduct\nExperiment and Observe subgoals.\nSearch Experiment Space\nThis goal aims to generate an experiment that is appropriate for the current\nset of hypotheses being examined, to make a prediction by running the\nsimulation experiment, and to match the outcome to expected behavior.\nOnce the Search Experiment Space component produces an experiment,\nconducting the experiment involves execution of the simulation and may\nrequire distributing the replications across multiple machines to improve the\nperformance. The Analyze (Compare) goal aims to describe the discrepancy\nbetween the expected behavior and the actual outcome. The comparison can\ninvolve statistical methods such as ANOVA analysis as well as formal methods\nthat leverage model checking. For instance, the results from simulation\nreplications can generate outcomes that can be generalized as a Markov model\nthat can be formally verified against finite-state verification patterns. When\ncompleted, the Test Hypothesis goal generates a representation of evidence\nfor or against the current hypotheses. The Evaluate Evidence component then\nuses this outcome.\nEvaluate Evidence\nThis component aims to determine whether the cumulative evidence warrants\nthe acceptance or rejection of competing hypotheses. Various criteria can\nbe used to evaluate evidence and hypotheses. These include plausibility,\nfunctionality, parsimony, etc. In the absence of hypotheses, experiments can\nbe generated by intelligently navigating the experiment space. During the\nEvaluate Evidence phase, three general outcomes are possible. The current\nset of coherent hypotheses can be accepted, rejected, or considered further.\nIn the first case, the discovery process stops. If the hypothesis is rejected,\nthen the system returns to the Search Hypothesis Space phase, which can\ntrigger two possible activities. If the entire mechanism template (frame) is\nrejected, then the system must attempt to generate a new mechanism. If the\nEvoke Mechanism goal cannot be satisfied or is unable to find an alternative\nmechanism, then the system will recourse to the Induce Mechanism subgoal,\nwhich requires running simulation experiments to generate outcomes that\ncan be generalized via induction. Having induced a new mechanism frame,\nor having returned from Evaluate Evidence with a frame needing revised\ninstances with new values, the system resumes with Template Instantiation. If\nprior knowledge is not applicable or available, here, too, the system may require\nrunning experiments to generate outcomes and to make value assignments.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In this context, the explanation model can\nserve dual purposes. Besides informing the user about the utility of competing\nmodel mechanisms, it can serve as a run-time model to guide the revision\nand selection of hypotheses, identifying which mechanisms to focus, and\nwhat experiments to generate to differentiate between competing models.\nThe users of an explainable cognitive model are end users who depend on\ndecisions and recommendations generated by the simulation and therefore\nneed to understand the rationale for the decisions. For example, an engineer\nwho receives recommendations needs to know why the cognitive model\nrecommends specific hypothesized mechanisms over others or particular\nexperiments for further investigation. In seeking a balance between theoretical\nprinciples, evidence, system constraints, and mechanisms, a strategy is needed\nto attain a state of coherent justification that accounts for the recommended\nmechanisms. Advances are needed in terms of principles and requirements\nand interactions with such explainable cognitive models, along with strategies,\nwhich can contribute to developing explainable cognitive models. The options\navailable include deep learning explanation, interpretable models, and model\ninduction.\nTheory of reflective equilibrium: For illustration purposes, consider Figure 24.5,\nwhich depicts a connectionist network comprised of observed or expected\nsystem behaviors or requirements that aim to explain these observations, and\nmodel mechanisms that facilitate addressing the requirements at different\nlevels of resolution. Furthermore, suppose that the system under investiga-\ntion is a self-organizing system, and the mechanisms are well-known patterns\nsuch as gradient-field, digital pheromones, as well as low-level supportive\nmechanisms such as tag-based, token-based, or market-based coordination\n(De Wolf and Holvoet 2006) with their specific template structures.\nModeling cognitive coherence: The hypothetical network shown in Figure 24.4\nevolves as learning takes place through experimentation. In this example, M1\nand M2 together facilitate R1 , and therefore, they are compatible, whereas,\nM3 provides an alternative to M1 and hence contradicts it. That is, they do not\ncohere. Similarly, tag-based coordination mechanism, M1.1 , and token-based\ncoordination, M1.2 , are alternative strategies that facilitate or contribute to\nthe higher-level mechanism, M1 . Therefore, they compete.

If we can view equilibrium in such a network as a stable state that\nbrings design conflicts to a level of resolution, the equilibrium state serves\nas a coherence account of model justification. As indicated by Daniels (1996)\nand Thagard (2016), an optimal equilibrium can then be attained when there\nis no further inclination to revise decisions, because together they have the\nhighest degree of acceptability.\nThe decisions that one arrives at when the equilibrium is reached can pro-\nvide an account for the solution under the system requirements examined.\nIn relation to our example shown in Figure 24.5, resolving conflicts among\nhypotheses from uncertainty to a stable, coherent state of equilibrium can be\ncharacterized as follows. Consider a finite set of cognitive elements ei and two\ndisjoint sets, C+ of positive constraints, and C\u2212 of negative constraints, where\na constraint is specified as a pair (e i; e j) and weight w ij. The set of cognitive\nelements is partitioned into two sets, accepted set (AS) and rejected set (RS),\nand w(A; R) is defined as the sum of the weights of the satisfied constraints\namong them. A satisfied constraint is defined as follows: (i) if (ei; e j) is in C+,\nthen e i is in AS if and only if e j is in AS. (ii) If (e i; e j) is in C\u2212 if and only if e j is\nin RS. When applied to practical and theoretical reasoning, these elements\nrepresent assumptions, goals, and propositions. The coherence problem can\nthen be viewed partly as a parallel constraint satisfaction problem, where the\ngoal is satisfying as many constraints as possible by propagating a wave of\nactivations while taking the significance (i.e. weights) of the constraints into\nconsideration.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Each node receives input from\nevery other node that it is connected with. The inputs can then be moder-\nated by the weights of the link from which the input arrives. The activation\nvalue of a unit is updated as a function of the weighted sum of the inputs it\nreceives. The process continues until the activation values of all units settle.\nFormally, if we define the activation level of each node j as aj, where a j ranges\nfrom \u22121 (rejected) and +1 (accepted), the update function can be defined as\nfollows:\naj(t + 1) =\n{a j(t)(1 \u2212 0) + netj(M \u2212 a j(t)), if netj > 0\na j(t)(1 \u2212 0) + netj(a j(t) \u2212 m), otherwise\nIn this rudimentary formulation, the variable \ud835\udf03 is a decay parameter that\ndecrements the activation level of each unit at every cycle. In the absence of\ninput from other units, the activation level of the unit gradually decays, with\nm being the minimum activation, M denoting the maximum activation, and\nnetj representing the net input to a unit, as defined as \u2211i w ij a i(t). These com-\nputations can be carried out for every node until the activation levels of ele-\nments stabilize and the network reaches an equilibrium via self-organization.\nNodes with positive activation levels at the equilibrium state can be distin-\nguished as maximally coherent hypotheses. For experimentation purposes,\nthe design of the network can be calibrated or fine-tuned to alter the links\u2019\nweights, which represent the significance of the constraints.\nConclusions\nFollowing the characterization of the nature of model-driven activities, the\nissues and challenges in model processing and cognitive activities involved\nin model-based scientific problem-solving are delineated. These challenges\nresulted in the formulation of a reference architecture that views mediator\nmodels as autonomous adaptive agents with learning capabilities. The premise\nof the strategy is based on the observed need for mediating between theory\nand data to facilitate their coherent integration. By aligning the mechanistic\nhypotheses or assumptions of a model with the empirical evidence or expected\nregularity, the mediation process aims to facilitate the process of computa-\ntional discovery by facilitating a search process across the technical spaces\nof models and experiments. We highlighted that such mediation requires\nflexibility in generating and evolving multiple models, and the underlying\ngenerative process continues until it converges to one or more competing\nand complementary models that can usefully and convincingly explain the\nsystemic properties of the phenomena of interest.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

FCMs offer a practical and flexible way to model and\nprocess the interwoven causal structure of policy and decision problems.\nExisting tools for causal modeling include Bayesian belief networks (BBNs)\nand system dynamics (SD) models. FCMs have some notable advantages\nover the default models of causality: FCMs model causal loops naturally, they\ncombine separate knowledge sources into a single FCM, and they permit fast\npattern inference and data-driven adaptation at low computational cost. FCMs\nalso lend themselves particularly well for modeling ambiguous elicited causal\nbeliefs because of their use of fuzz. A flexible and robust modeling approach\nfor capturing causal beliefs is important for social and behavioral models since\nbeliefs are foundational to many observed behaviors.\nThe next sections describe FCMs briefly. We conclude with two FCM policy\napplications. The first shows how FCMs can assist in modeling the many causal\nand policy factors involved in public support for insurgency and terrorism\n(PSOT). The second shows how an FCM model can give insight into Allison\u2019s\nrecent Thucydides\u2019 trap model of US\u2013China conflict. We draw on a recent\njournal paper that includes more technical details (Osoba and Kosko 2017).\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

These causal diagrams can have closed loops or paths\nin them. The closed loops directly model feedback among the causal concepts\nor nodes (as in Figure 25.1). They are fuzzy because the causal arrows in the\ndiagrams admit degrees or shades of gray. Users can make what-if predictions\nwith a given FCM: What happens given this input policy? The predictions are\nnot numerical predictions. They are pattern predictions or repeating sequences\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u20131\n\u20131\n\u20131\n\u20131\n\u20131 \u20131\n\u20131\n1\n1\nC1: Herd\nclustering\nC2: Fatigue C3: Rest\nC4: Survival\nthreat\nC5: Run away\nFigure 25.1 Fragment of a predator\u2013prey fuzzy cognitive map that describes dolphin\nbehavior in the presence of sharks or other survival threats (Dickerson and Kosko 1994). The\nedges in this FCM are trivalent: eij \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}. Each nonzero edge defines a causal if-then\nrule: the dolphin pod decreases its resting behavior if a shark or other survival threat is\npresent. But the survival threat increases if the pod rests more. These two causal links define\na minimal cycle or feedback loop within the FCM\u2019s causal web. Such feedback cycles endow\nthe FCM with transient and equilibrium dynamics. All inputs produce equilibrium limit cycles\nor fixed-point attractors in the simplest case when all nodes are bivalent threshold functions\nand when the system updates all nodes at each iteration.

Users can also ask why questions in some case: Why did these events\noccur? Different users can also fuse or combine their FCM diagrams into a\nunified FCM. These FCM techniques are quite general and have led to numer-\nous applications (Glykas 2010; Papageorgiou 2013; Papageorgiou and Salmeron\n2013; Amirkhani et al. 2017). A recent notable application uses an FCM to make\nsense of the impact of \u201cBrexit\u201d on food, energy, and water systems in the UK\n(Ziv et al. 2018).\nAn FCM uses an arrow or directed graph edge to describe how one concept\nnode causally affects another concept node. So an FCM represents causality as\na directed edge in graph. An FCM model of military deterrence might include\nconcept nodes for the degree of national military capability and for the degree\nof a threat\u2019s credibility. The directed causal edges among two or more such\nconcept nodes define a directed graph or digraph. A key aspect of FCMs is\nthat in general their digraphs contain cycles or feedback loops. This means that\nmost FCMs are not directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\nFuzz\nFuzz is a term of art in logic and engineering. It denotes degree of truth or\ndegree of causality. Fuzzy logic extends binary logic to multivalued logic and\nallows rule-based approximate reasoning (Zadeh 1965; Kosko and Isaka 1993).\nFCMs are fuzzy both in their causal edges and often in their concept nodes.\nFuzzy causal edges denote partial causality. All-or-none causality can still occur\nbut only as the end points of the spectrum of causal influence. The same holds\nfor the activation of a concept node. Concept nodes are often binary in prac-\ntice and in the examples below. More sophisticated FCM models use fuzzy\ngray-scale concept nodes and may also use time lags.\nFeedback loops in an FCM imply that an FCM is a dynamical system. Inputs\nstimulate the FCM system. The causal activation then technically swirls around\nin the FCM forever or until a new input perturbs the system. Most FCMs\nquickly reach an equilibrium. The equilibrium serves as the system\u2019s what-if\nprediction or forward inference from the input. FCMs with binary nodes\nusually converge to a limit cycle or a repeating sequence of states. The cycle of\nstates is a form of pattern prediction.\nComparison with Other Methods\nTwo other approaches to modeling causal worlds are system-dynamics SD\nmodels (Sterman 2000; Abdelbari and Shafi 2018) and BBNs (Pearl 2009).\nSD models allow users to represent and simulate causal interactions within\nrelatively complex systems. SD has a long history of modeling practice. The full\npicture on the relative modeling strengths of FCM and SD models may take\nsome time to emerge. But we can point out a few key advantages of FCMs.\nFor example SD models are statically parameterized. This means they are notDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Domain expertise\nor random experimentation often chooses the parameters of the subsystems\nand their interconnections. FCMs admit both data-driven and expert-driven\nadaptation of the model structure and the model parameters. Statistical learn-\ning algorithms estimate causal edges from training data. Experts can also state\nedge values directly. SD models can account for uncertainty by doing sensi-\ntivity testing or Monte Carlo analysis. FCMs build uncertainty into their very\nstructure.\nBBNs represent uncertain causal worlds with conditional probabilities.\nA user must state a known joint probability distribution over all the nodes of\nthe directed graph. Forward inference on a BBN tends to be computationally\nintensive. The directed graph is usually acyclic graph and thus has no closed\nloops. The acyclic structure simplifies the probability structure but ignores\nfeedback among the causal units. This is an important limitation for social\nand behavioral models that often feature causal loops (such as preferential\nattachment in social networks). The acyclic constraint also makes it hard to\ncombine BBN causal models from multiple experts because such combination\nmay well produce a cycle. FCMs contain causal loops by design. Combining\nFCMs only tends to increase the loop or feedback structure and therefore\nproduces richer dynamics. It also tends to improve the modeling accuracy in\nmany cases. FCM forward-inference process is also simple and fast because it\nuses only vector\u2013matrix multiplication and thresholding. But BBNs do give\nprecise numerical probability descriptions and not the mere pattern predic-\ntions of FCMs. So FCMs trade numerical precision for pattern approximation,\nfaster and scalable computation, and richer feedback representation.\nFCMs offer substantial value for social scientific modeling and simulation.\nFCMs can capture the causal beliefs of domain experts. FCM dynamics can\nreveal global hidden patterns in small or large causal webs. These patterns tend\nto far from obvious when examining a large-scale FCM model. The domain\nexpert expresses his beliefs about how relevant factors causally relate to one\nanother. Some examples of such expert-based FCMs include public support\nfor terrorism (Osoba and Kosko 2017), blood-clotting reactions (Taber et al.\n2007), and medical diagnostics (Stylios et al. 2008). An analyst can also con-\nvert documents into FCMs. We show below an example translating Graham\nAllison\u2019s textual descriptions of his proposed Thucydides\u2019 Trap of international\nrelations into a predictive FCM. FCMs can also apply driving agents\u2019 behav-\niors or decisions in agent-based models (ABMs). Prior work (Dickerson and\nKosko 1993) shows how lone or combined FCMs can govern the behavior of\nagents or virtual actors. These behaviors can be simple or complex depending\non the driving FCM. Applying learning laws to the agents\u2019 FCMs can simulate\nthe effect of agents learning new behaviors (Figure 25.3).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The cycles also produce complex nonlinear dynamics. FCM causal\ninference maps input states or policies to equilibria of the nonlinear dynamical\nsystem. Users can also step through time slices of the FCM dynamical system\nto at least partially unfold the system in time.\nAn FCM\u2019s feedback structure contrasts with the acyclic structure of BBNs.\nBBNs form the basis of Pearl\u2019s popular model of causal inference (Pearl\n2009). Rubin\u2019s counterfactual approach to causality is a related statistical\nmodel (Rubin 2005; Imbens and Rubin 2015). BBNs for causal inference\nassign probabilities to a DAG. Their acyclic causal tree structure rules out\nfeedback pathways. This strong acyclic assumption greatly simplifies the\nprobability calculus on such digraphs and may permit finer control when\npropagating probabilistic beliefs. But the acyclic structure is hard to recon-\ncile with the inherent and extensive feedback causality of large-scale social\nphenomena from social networks to state-vs.-state wars. These social systems\nare high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. They have dynamics\nbecause they have feedback loops.\nProbabilistic inference on a graph computes the conditional probability\nP(CO|CEv) of output nodes CO given a state vector on observable evidence\nnodes CEv . This computation involves a complex marginalization operation on\ngeneral DAGs. It also assumes that the user knows the closed-form joint prob-\nability distribution on all the nodes. The computation often requires complex\nmessage-passing algorithms such as belief propagation (Yedidia et al. 2001;\nMurphy 2002) or the more general junction-tree algorithm (Wainwright and\nJordan 2008). This probabilistic computation is NP-hard in general (Dagum\nand Luby 1993; Russell et al. 2016).\nLoops or cycles in a causal graph model may render exact probabilistic\ninference difficult if it is even feasible. Inexact or loopy inference schemes can\ngive useful approximations in many cases. These methods include loopy belief\npropagation, variational Bayesian methods, mean field methods, and some\nforms of Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (Beal and Ghahramani 2003,\n2006; Wainwright and Jordan 2008; Pearl 2014). But loopy algorithms are still\nNP-hard and may not even converge.\nFCM forward inference uses light computation. It requires only vector\u2013\nmatrix multiplication and nonlinear transformations of vectors. The\ntransformations are often hard or soft thresholds. So FCM forward inference\nhas only polynomial-time complexity. This means that FCMs scale fairly well to\nproblems with high dimension or multiple concept nodes. Simple binary-state\nFCMs converge quickly to limit-cycle equilibria given an input stimulus\n(Kosko 1991).

The first is that a user may\nnot be able to use some predicted outcomes. A user may find it hard to interpret\nan FCM\u2019s what-if predictions because they are equilibria of a highly nonlinear\ndynamical system. Simple predictions may be limit cycles that consist of only a\nfew ordered system states. The dolphin FCM below is one such case. One equi-\nlibrium output consists of four binary vectors that repeat in sequence. Richer\ndynamics can produce aperiodic or chaotic equilibria in regions of the FCM\nstate space. Such predicted outcomes may have no clear policy interpretation if\nwe cannot clearly associate the equilibrium attractor\u2019s region of the FCM state\nspace with a temporally ordered sequence of FCM states.\nA more fundamental limitation is that FCMs do not easily answer why ques-\ntions given observed outcomes. FCMs do not easily admit backward inference\nfrom effects to causes because FCM nodes are neural-like nonlinear mappings\nof causal inputs to outputs. A user may need to test a wide range of random\ninputs to see which FCM states map to or near a given observed or conjectured\noutput state. We often check all possible input policy states to find all output\nequilibria. We did this with Thucydides\u2019 trap FCM below by clamping on input\npolicy variables while the FCM dynamical system converged. We also tested\nthis FCM\u2019s pattern predictions against those of a thresholded FCM whose edge\nvalues were the trivalent extremes of \u22121, 0, or 1. The thresholded FCM gave\nsimilar equilibrium predictions.\nCombining Causal Knowledge: Averaging Edge Matrices\nCausal modeling faces a threshold epistemic question when dealing with\nmultiple experts: How do we combine the causal models of multiple knowledge\nsources? Such knowledge fusion is a key function in many decision-making pro-\ncesses (Kosko 1986c, 1988; Taber 1991; Taber et al. 2007; Davis et al. 2015a,b).\nA common answer avoids the question by combining the causal knowledge or\nexpertise before it enters a causal model. Some form of this knowledge prepro-\ncessing occurs with AI search trees and other DAG models. Multiple knowledge\nsources may lead a knowledge engineer to draw or otherwise modify a weighted\ncausal arrow in a model. That differs from first letting each source have its\nown causal arrow and then combining. This fit-all-in-one-model approach may\nwork well for problems of small dimension or small expert sample size. Even\nthen it may obscure the disparate knowledge that went into the representation.\nBut it can ensure that a causal DAG stays a DAG as it encodes new informa-\ntion. The approach can become more ad hoc and restrictive as the expert sample\nsize m grows. The likelihood of getting a causal cycle only increases with expert\nsample size and the node count of the model.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nCombining Causal Knowledge: Averaging Edge Matrices 593\nFCMs answer the epistemic question directly: average the causal FCMs of\neach expert (Kosko 1988, 1991; Taber 1991). Preprocessing can still occur.\nBut there is no limit to the number m of FCMs that averaging can combine.\nFCMs naturally combine into a new FCM. So FCM combination is a closed\ngraph-theoretical operation. And the resulting FCM has all the representative\nproperties of a sample average.\nThe loop-free structure of BBNs\u2019 DAGs makes it hard to do this sort of com-\nbination of causal models from multiple experts. Combining DAGs need not\nproduce a new DAG. So combining DAGs is not a closed graph-theoretical\noperation in general. Some experts will tend to draw opposing causal arrows\nbetween nodes. Others will tend to add links that create multi-node closed\nloops.\nThe FCM average forms a mixture or convex combination of the causal edges.\nThe user can combine any number of FCMs by adding their underlying aug-\nmented adjacency matrices. A group of m experts can each produce an FCM\ncausal edge matrix Ek that describes some fixed problem domain. Each expert\ncan model different concept and policy nodes. The total number of nodes is n.\nAugment the edge matrices with zero rows and columns for any missing nodes\nin an expert\u2019s causal edge matrix. Then FCM knowledge fusion or combination\ntakes the weighted average of their augmented causal edge matrices:\nEm =\nm\n\u2211\nk=1\nw k Ek (25.1)\nwhere the weights w k are convex weights and hence nonnegative and sum\nto one.\nThe weights w k can reflect relative expert credibility in the problem domain.\nThey can reflect test scores or subjective rankings or some other measure of\nthe experts\u2019 predictive accuracy in prior experiments. The same weight w k need\nnot apply to the entire kth FCM edge matrix. Each edge value can have its own\nweight. So a weight matrix W k corresponds to each expert\u2019s FCM edge matrix.\nPredd et al. (2008) developed a method for combining expert inputs when the\nexperts abstain or when they are incoherent. Voting schemes (Conitzer et al.\n2009; Caragiannis et al. 2013) might also pick the FCM weights and affect the\nfusion process. We here take the weights as given and use equal weights as a\ndefault.\nThe m edge matrices Ek in (25.1) must be conformable for addition. So they\nmust have the same number of rows and columns and in the same matrix posi-\ntions. So we first take the union of all concept nodes from all m knowledge\nsources. This again gives a total of n distinct concept nodes. Then we zero-pad\nor add rows and columns of zeros for missing nodes in a given knowledge\nsource\u2019s causal edge matrix. This gives a conformable n-by-n signed fuzzy adja-\ncency matrix Ek after permuting rows and columns to bring them in mutual\ncoincidence with all the other zero-padded augmented matrices.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Then the weighted average in (25.1) can only reduce the\ninherent variance in the expert sample FCMs. So the knowledge fusion process\nimproves with sample size m. Simulations have shown that the equilibrium\nlimit cycles of the combined FCM tend to resemble the limit cycles of the m\nindividual FCMs (Taber et al. 2007). An expert random sample is sufficient\nfor this convergence result but not necessary. A combined FCM may still give\na representative knowledge base when the expert responses are somewhat\ncorrelated or when the experts do not all have the same level of expertise or\nproblem-domain focus. Users can also use policy articles or books or legal\ntestimony as proxy experts.\nFigure 25.2 shows the minimal combination case where two FCMs fuse into\none representative FCM. The mixture or convex combination of FCMs creates\na new fused FCM as the weighted averages of the FCMs\u2019 augmented signed\nfuzzy adjacency matrices. Users can add new concept nodes or factors at will.\nEach new factor converts all m n-by-n edge matrices into n + 1-by-n + 1 edge\nmatrices. This again amounts to adding a new zero-padded row and column\nto an edge matrix if its corresponding FCM does not include the factor as a\nconcept node. An expert has a zero row and column for a concept node if the\nexpert impliedly states that concept is not causally relevant.\nThis fusion averaging technique can reflect bad effects as well as any other\neffect. The technique can reflect anomalous effects due to active sabotage or\nextreme variance in expert opinions.\nLearning FCM Causal Edges\nWe turn next to inferring the directed causal edges e ij from time-series data.\nCorrelation does not imply causation. But some time-lagged correlations sug-\ngest causation. This is the idea behind the unsupervised learning laws below for\nestimating the directed causal edges eij. They are unsupervised because there is\nno teaching signal that the learning process matches against.\nWe can learn causal edge strengths through the concomitant activation\namong the factor pairs. This approach assumes that events (factor activities)\nare more likely to involve a causal connection if the events occur together\n(Hebb 1949; Kosko 1986a, 1991). This suggests the well-known Hebbian\ncorrelation learning law (neurons that fire together wire together) for training\nneural network synaptic weights (Kosko 1991):\u0307\ne ij = \u2212e ij + Ci Cj (25.2)Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Expert 1 has a larger FCM than Expert 2 has because Expert 1 uses an extra concept\nnode. FCM knowledge combination fuses their knowledge webs by averaging their causal edge adjacency matrices with the mixing\nequation (25.1). This weighted average uses each expert\u2019s causal edge matrix E = 2\n3 E1 + 1\n3 E2 as shown in the combined (third) FCM.

Such concomitant variation or covariation leads to the\ndifferential Hebbian learning (DHL) law (Kosko 1986a, 1988, 1991):\u0307\ne ij = \u2212e ij +\u0307 Ci\u0307 Cj (25.3)\nWe use concomitant activation and variation as proxies for causation during\nunsupervised learning with Hebbian and DHL laws. Hebbian learning tends to\nlearn spurious causal links between any two concept nodes that occur at the\nsame time. This quickly grows an edge matrix of nearly all unity values if most\nof the nodes are active. DHL correlates node velocities. So it has a type of arrow\nof time built into it. DHL correlates the signs of the time derivatives. So it grows\na positive causal edge value eij if and only if the concept nodes Ci and Cj both\nincrease or both decrease. It grows a negative edge value if and only if one of\nthe nodes increases and the other decreases.\nBoth learning laws combine to give a more general version of DHL (Kosko\n1988):\u0307\ne ij = \u2212e ij + Ci Cj +\u0307 Ci\u0307 Cj (25.4)\nThis hybrid learning law fills in expected values for edge-strength values when\nthere is no signal variation in the factor set (Kosko 1990). The hybrid law takes\nadvantage of the relatively rarer variation events to update the edge weights. It\nalso tends to produce limit cycles or even more complex equilibrium attractors.\nIt can produce fixed-point attractors given some strong mathematical assump-\ntions (Kosko 1988, 1991).\nMost applications use discretized versions of the DHL law (Kosko 1996) in\n(25.3):\neij(t + 1) =\n{e ij(t) + \ud835\udf07[\u0394Ci(t)\u0394Cj(t) \u2212 e ij(t)] \u0394Ci(t) \u2260 0\neij(t) else (25.5)\nwhere \u0394Ck (t) = Ck (t) \u2212 Ck (t \u2212 1).\nDHL can infer causal edge values in an FCM if the system has access to\nenough time-series data. Such data can again come from expert opinion\nsurveys. It can come from direct time-series data on measurable factors. Or it\ncan come from indirect instrumental variables linked to the factors of interest:Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Figures 25.3 shows DHL applied to learning a single\ncausal edge value from empirical data. Figure 25.3 shows the DHL training\ndata for an edge value using Google Trends time-series data on the use of\npolitically charged terms \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d (BLM), \u201cAll lives matter\u201d (ALM),\nand Blue lives matter\u201d (BlueLM) in online discourse.\nWe can also fuse soft and hard knowledge sources through the above averag-\ning technique in (25.1). Let \ue231data denote the data-driven FCM. Let Eexp denote\nthe expert-elicited FCM. Then the fused causal edge matrix Efusion is a simple\nmixture of the two edge matrices:\nEfusion = \ud835\udf14dataEdata + \ud835\udf14expEexp (25.6)\nThen (25.5) or some other statistical learning law can continue the adapta-\ntion process by using new numerical data or occasional opinion updates from\nexperts.\nWe can also learn edge values by taking a cue from the literature on\nBayesian networks (Friedman and Koller 2003). This entails putting a prior\non a randomized FCM. Assume first that the FCM graph is random. Assume\nnext a prior over the space of amenable graphs. Then use observed node data\nto update a posterior distribution of compatible FCM graphs. This Bayesian\nprocess requires a calibrated understanding of the topology and size of the\ngraph spaces. The process also requires that the user produce an accurate and\ntractable closed-form prior for the graphs. Fuzzy rules can directly represent\nthese closed-form priors (Osoba et al. 2011).\nLearning need not take place only in a stationary causal environment where\nthe underlying causal relations do not change in time. Causal relations are apt to\nchange in large-scale problems of social science. Figure 25.3 gives an example.\nAdaptive FCMs can still model these nonstationary causal worlds if the causal\nworld does not change too fast and if the FCM learning system has access to\nenough time-series data that reflects these changes.\nFCM Example: Public Support for Insurgency\nand Terrorism\nOur first substantive FCM policy example is to the problem of public support\nfor insurgency and terrorism (PSOT). We based two PSOT FCMs on the\nfactor-tree PSOT analysis of Davis et al. (2012) and Davis and O\u2019Mahony\n(2013). PSOT has complex sociopolitical causes (Ibrahim 2007; Snow et al.\n2008; Davis and Cragin 2009; Davis et al. 2012; Nawaz 2015) that involve\nnumerous factors.

Figure 25.4 and Table 25.1\ngive more details of the PSOT factor tree. The PSOT nodes represent factors\nthat directly or indirectly relate to the PSOT concept.\nDavis\u2019s factor-tree models are multi-resolution models (Davis and Bigelow\n1998). Major elements have a hierarchical structure that allows users to specify\nfactors at different levels of detail. Each node is an exogenously driven factor,\nor it fires or activates based on a function of its inputs.\nThere are also crosscutting factors besides sub-node factors. Crosscutting\nfactors affect multiple factors simultaneously. The \u223cand nodes depend on all\nfan-in factors being present to a first approximation. The \u223cor nodes depend on\nany of the fan-in factors being active or on a combination of the fan-in factors\nbeing active. There are several top-level factors that directly relate to the general\nPSOT of (Davis et al. 2012): effectiveness of the organization EFF, motivation\nfor supporting the group/cause MOTV , the perceived legitimacy of violence\nPLEG, and the acceptability of costs and risks ACR. Each of these factors has\nattendant contributory sub-factors.\nPSOT edges denote positive influences by default. We denote negative edges\nwith \u2212 as with an FCM causal decrease edge. Factor activation along a neg-\native edge reduces the activation of the parent factor. We denote ambiguous\nedges with \u00b1. The ambiguity refers to uncertainty over the edge\u2019s direction of\ninfluence.\nWe based our FCM models on the important case of the Al-Qaeda transna-\ntional terrorist organization. We augmented the original PSOT with cross-links\nin the dynamic model to allow richer representation of SD.\nDavis et al. (2012) have discussed how the PSOT model explains the public\nsupport for Al-Qaeda\u2019s mission as follows (paraphrased from Davis et al.\n(2012)). The organizational effectiveness of Al-Qaeda depends in part on the\ncharisma, strategic thinking, and organizational skills of its leadership (lead).\nAl-Qaeda has framed its ideology to appeal to many Muslims worldwide.\nMotivation for public support of Al-Qaeda\u2019s beliefs comes from shared\nreligious beliefs that stress common identity (id) and the sense of duty (duty)\nthat such identity fosters. Al-Qaeda also relies on a popular narrative of shared\ngrievances (shgr) in the Muslim world. Al-Qaeda stresses the perceived glory\n(glry) of supporting a cause that aims to redress these purported grievances.\nReligious beliefs and intolerance (intl) help increase the perceived legitimacy\n(PLEG) of violence against the West and against the many Muslims who do\nnot share their Salafist views. Countervailing pressure (scst) discourages more\nsupport for Al-Qaeda. This countervailing pressure occurs in part because\nmuch of the public believes that Al-Qaeda will not succeed and thus emerge\nas ultimate victors (lvic). This pressure reduces the acceptability of costs and\nrisks (ACR) for Al-Qaeda activities. The parameters of this Al-Qaeda case\nstudy determined the relative causal edge weights in our FCM models.\nFigure 25.5 shows FCM versions of the old static (acyclic) PSOT model and\nnew dynamic PSOT model.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We first added a\nweak self-excitation feedback loop to the PSOT concept node because it is the\nhighest-level concept node. This self-excitation loop modeled inertia in aggre-\ngate public opinion about insurgency and terrorism. This new feedback source\ninduced a weak serial correlation in time in the PSOT concept node.\nThe next directed edges connected the top-level factors in (Davis and\nO\u2019Mahony(2013) from left to right: EFF \u2192 MOTV , MOTV \u2192 PLEG, and\nPLEG \u2192 ACR. These directed causal edges made explicit an implicit point\nabout O\u2019Mahony and Davis\u2019s use of factor trees. Their factor-tree representa-\ntion assumed a left-to-right dependence of the top-level factors that we have\nlinked (Davis 2011; Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2013). This implicit dependence\nmade their factor tree more readable. The FCM model made this dependence\nexplicit.\nO\u2019Mahony and Davis (2013) discuss other dynamic augmentations to the\nPSOT model. They point to the following new factors. A history of successes or\nfailures can affect motivation and perceived risks. We model this dependence\nwith factors history of successes and history of failures. These two nodes exert\nopposing influence on MOTV and prsk. We split this history factor because\ntraditional FCM models admit only positive values that represent the degree or\nintensity to which a concept occurs. The effectiveness of the organization fac-\ntor EFF partly determines the history of successes: EFF \u2192 hsucc. Unacceptable\ngroup behavior ugb also influences motivation and effectiveness: ugb \u2192 MOTV\nand ugb \u2192 EFF.\nUS\u2013China Relations: An FCM of Allison\u2019s Thucydides\nTrap\nWe next use an FCM to model a new conflict dynamic in international relations.\nPolitical scientist Graham Allison calls this dynamic Thucydides\u2019 trap\n(Allison 2015, 2017). Allison argues that this dynamic occurs when a new\npower emerges that challenges the dominance of an older power on the\nworld stage.

We stress again that the prevalence of a war outcome in\nthis model does not mean that the FCM predicts war with high probability. That\nwould require that all input states are equally likely and they clearly are not. We\ndid not address the issue of which inputs are more or less likely to occur. Our\ntask was to translate Allison\u2019s textual claims into a representative FCM causal\nmodel and explore its pattern predictions.\nThe name Thucydides\u2019 trap stems from a famous political conjecture in\nThucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian War (Thucydides 1998) (Book 1,\nparagraph 23): \u201cthe real though unavowed cause [of the war] I believe to have\nbeen the growth of Athenian power, which terrified the [Spartans] and forced\nthem into war.\u201d Thucydides expands on his causal theory of war in a speech\nthat an Athenian gives to the Spartan assembly (Thucydides 1998) (Book 1,\nparagraph 76):\nSo that, though overcome by three of the greatest things, honor, fear,\nand profit, we have both accepted the dominion delivered us and refuse\nagain to surrender it, we have therein done nothing to be wondered at\nnor beside the manner of men. Nor have we been the first in this kind,\nbut it hath been ever a thing fixed for the weaker to be kept under by the\nstronger.\nThucydides claimed that three main factors determine how nation-states\ninteract: interest, fear, and honor. The interest or profit factor just restates\na nation\u2019s self-interested actions. Nation-states act against other states to\nmaintain their high-priority national interests within the geographic scope\nof their power. These interests include national security, economic security,\nand sovereignty. Fear refers to the emotionally charged frames through which\na nation views world events. Honor refers to the nation\u2019s senses of self and\nentitlement. Examples include the nineteenth-century US manifest destiny or\nChina\u2019s older concept of Tianxia or all under heaven.\nAllison expands on these factors in his Thucydides\u2019 trap model where again\nthe rise of a new power risks war with a dominant power. He argues that fear is\nthe main cause of war between such a dominant power and a new rising power.\nHe looked at 16 such historical power struggles that extend back to the fif-\nteenth century. He found that 12 of these power struggles ended in war. Allison\nalso contends that similar structural dynamics apply elsewhere in international\nrelations.\nWe parsed Allison\u2019s analysis (Allison 2017) to create an FCM of Thucydides\u2019\ntrap for current US\u2013China relations. The FCM follows Thucydides and uses his\nthree main factors of interest, fear, and honor. Auxiliary factors give context to\nthe main factors. The resulting Thucydides\u2019 trap FCM has 17 factors.

One example is how nuclear weapons affect the chance of all-out\nwar. Diplomatic institutions and economic dependencies also affect the chance\nof war. Treaty and alliance obligations can rapidly induce or expand war as hap-\npened in both world wars. The FCM in Figure 25.6 shows the directed causal\nedges among the concepts and the FCM\u2019s causal edge matrix representation E.\nWe surmised the causal edge strengths based on Allison\u2019s discussions in (Alli-\nson 2017).

The FCM\u2019s state evolution showed that China\u2019s eco-\nnomic dominance led to a clash in national interests while the US defensive\nposture led to fear. This led China to ramp up its defensive posture. The US\npublic\u2019s resentment toward China led to a sense of entitlement. That led in turn\nto Chinese public resentment. The clash in national interests, fear, and sense of\nentitlement or national honor combined to activate the WAR \u2217 node. This FCM\nbehavior is similar to Thucydides\u2019 trap dynamics that Allison described.\nThe FCM\u2019s war prediction was robust against many perturbations of the\ninput state.

Their cyclic structure produces a nonlinear dynam-\nical system that tends to quickly equilibrate to limit-cycle predictions given a\ncausal input or stimulus. Users can also step through FCM transient or equilib-\nrium states and therefore unfold the dynamical system in time. The underlying\nmatrix structure of an FCM\u2019s directed causal edges permits natural knowledge\nfusion through simply adding or mixing the augmented FCM causal edge matri-\nces for any number of experts. Such knowledge combination tends to improve\nwith the number of combined experts.\nDAGs lack these features precisely because they are acyclic. Their use of\nprobability to describe causal uncertainty is secondary to their lack of cycles.\nCycles describe feedback in directed graphs. And combining directed graphs\nwill in general produce several such cycles. The vector\u2013matrix operations of\nFCMs also involve much less computation than the probabilistic computations\nin BBNs. But FCMs cannot produce the precise probability descriptions\nthat DAGs can if the user knows the DAG\u2019s corresponding complete joint\nprobability density function and uses the sum\u2013product algorithm. Imposing\nthis or a related probability structure on an FCM is an area for future research.\nCurrent FCM inference and learning have two key limitations that future\nresearch also needs to address. The first is that FCMs do not easily permit\nbackward chaining. So they do not in general answer which input caused an\nobserved output effect. Users cannot simply run the FCM in reverse because\nof the node nonlinearities. We instead must exhaustively test all or nearly all\ninput states to see which inputs map to which output equilibria. This computes\nthe inverse image of each output attractor basin. It carves the FCM state space\ninto attractor regions. We know for a given output only that the input came\nfrom an attractor region. Future research should address this limitation with\nnew inferencing or other techniques.\nThe second limitation is more challenging: How do we infer missing FCM\nconcept nodes? This just asks how we come up with a new causal hypothesis.\nA new node leads to new causal conjectures for all nonzero edges that con-\nnect to the new node. Current adaptive techniques infer and tune the causal\nedge values only for known concept nodes. An open research problem is to find\ndata-based techniques that infer new or missing concept nodes in large-scale\nFCM causal models. Solutions may include Bayesian priors or rules over node\nsets or other statistical techniques for model building.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These phenomena are behaviorally driven\nand exhibit coupling between multiple systems and multiple spatiotemporal\nscales and also offer many opportunities for interventions. These modeling and\nsimulation efforts are giving rise to interesting new questions that need to be\naddressed through new methods that combine data analytics and simulation\nscience, which we refer to as simulation analytics.\nSimulation-based approaches are needed for these complex problems\nbecause policy and planning require understanding hypothetical (counter-\nfactual) scenarios, answering what-if and under-what-conditions questions\n(Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2019), and discovering interventions. High-resolution\nand data-driven simulations of adequate representational complexity provide\na natural way of addressing these requirements. For instance, if during an\ninfectious disease epidemic, an epidemiologist wishes to understand the\npotential consequences of closing a particular school for a certain number of\ndays, it helps to have a model that has a representation of said school and of\nthe behaviors of students on school days as well as nonschool days.\nOver the last two decades, social simulations have gotten increasingly larger\nand more sophisticated. For example, the first TRANSIMS simulation modeled\nthe Dallas\u2013Ft. Worth area in Texas without a detailed representation of daily\n1 Eubank et al. (2004), Haas et al. (2012), Zou et al.

In 2004, Eubank et al. (2004) described the\nuse of much more refined synthetic populations for high-fidelity urban-scale\nepidemic simulations. In 2011, Parker and Epstein (2011) developed a platform\nfor global-scale epidemic simulation, albeit without the kind of representational\ndetail described above.\nIn terms of the level of detail and amount of data used in model design, sim-\nulations have also rapidly increased in sophistication. Early stylized models of\nregions (Batty and Xie 1994) led to models with accurate demographics and\ngeospatial information (Eubank et al. 2004). These, in turn, have led to even\nmore complex simulations, such as the simulation of National Planning Sce-\nnario 1, by Barrett et al. (2013), which includes highly detailed, data-driven\nmodels of multiple infrastructures and human behavior after a disaster in addi-\ntion to an accurate population model.\nThese simulations are intuitive to build and understand in that they require\nspecifying models of individual behavior and interactions. The simulation then\ncomputes the population-level consequences of the millions of interactions\nbetween individuals that occur during the event or phenomenon. Indeed, this\nis the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the simulation, since we cannot compute population-level\nconsequences any other way from specifications of the individual behavior,\nat least once the individual behaviors get reasonably complex. For example,\nclosed-form mathematical modeling of complex behaviors and millions of\ninteracting agents would not be tractable.\nHigh resolution, fidelity, precision, and accuracy of a simulation contribute\nto its veridicality and therefore its ability to provide actionable information.2\nHowever, these properties, by making the simulation more complex, also make\nit more opaque to inspection. With a toy simulation, we can completely explore\nthe parameter space and run large statistical experiment designs, thus obtaining\na comprehensive understanding of the phenomena that emerge within the sim-\nulation. This experiment design approach is applied to larger simulations also,\nwhere we choose a few possible interventions (or perhaps vary some parame-\nters of interest) and run the simulation for each case to examine differences in\nthe outcomes of interest (Halloran et al. 2008).\nAs we push the boundaries of scale and complexity, however, we encounter\ntwo problems: (i) we do not know the right interventions to try ahead of\ntime, i.e. we would like to use the simulation as a means of discovering useful\ninterventions, and (ii) we can run the simulation only a small number of times\nin a reasonable amount of time. This limits the statistical power we can obtain\nto distinguish outcomes between the different cells of a statistical experiment\ndesign. However, we retain two important advantages over empirical data.\n2 While validation is not discussed here, it is a crucial step in the design and use of a simulation. It\nis of course possible to have a lot of high-fidelity detail in a simulation that is ultimately irrelevant,\nor even erroneous, with respect to the question being studied. Uncertainty quantification and\nsensitivity analysis are also important in understanding the applicability of a simulation.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Second, more fundamentally, we\nhave complete knowledge of the computation being carried out internally by\neach agent, since we design and implement the agents. This does not mean,\nhowever, that we know the effective computation being carried out by each\nagent, since that also depends on the agent\u2019s interactions with other agents\nand with the environment. In fact, this is a crucial question to be addressed\nthrough simulation analytics.\nIn sum, this is a unique regime of investigation. Sensemaking in this regime is\na big data challenge. These simulations produce a large amount of richly struc-\ntured data and give rise to several novel questions, which require new methods\nto be developed. We will explore some of these in what follows, especially in\nreference to social and behavioral modeling.\nWhat Are Behaviors?\nIn order to design meaningful simulations, we need an operational understand-\ning of the notion of behavior, in the sense of being able to create a computational\nmodel that captures the essentials of behavior with respect to a given domain.\nSuch an operational description of human behavior is closely tied to models of\nbounded rationality, individual agency, social influence, and social structure. It\nis worthwhile thinking about what each of these terms mean and how they get\ntranslated into computational simulations.\nThe idea of simulating a population of interacting units by means of a com-\nputer goes back to Orcutt (1957). By the general term units, he indicated the\nflexibility of the method to model individuals, households, or firms. In his con-\nception, units receive inputs and produce outputs based on probability distri-\nbutions connecting inputs and outputs. This very general approach is what we\nterm microsimulation today (Li and O\u2019Donoghue 2013). Microsimulations are\nused in many domains and are essential in at least two types of situations.\nFirst, as an illustrative example, consider the problem of estimating popula-\ntion exposure to extreme heat. This can be done by providing a set of individuals\nwith temperature sensors that can log their exposure as they go about their\ndaily routines. This is an expensive approach and is further beset by the prob-\nlem that the variation in temperature across a large region (such as a US state)\nmakes it difficult to generalize from the sample to the population. However,\na microsimulation of the region, which includes typical daily activity patterns\nof individuals and high-resolution temperature data, can be used to estimate\nexposure (Swarup et al. 2017). Indeed, it is necessary if we wish to compute\npopulation heat exposure without recruiting a very large (and prohibitively\nexpensive) sample.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Such diseases spread from person to person over a social\ncontact network, which is the network induced by physical collocation as people\ngo about their daily activities. The social contact network is impossible to esti-\nmate through a survey, even if you could survey every single person, because\nmost people do not know all the other people with whom they are physically\ncollocated on a typical day. We can, however, synthesize the social contact net-\nwork by integrating the appropriate data sets. This is known as the synthetic\npopulation approach where multiple data sets, including the census, travel, and\nactivity surveys, and geospatial data are integrated to construct a representa-\ntion of the demographics, activity patterns, and activity locations of the entire\npopulation of a region, from which a synthetic social contact network can be\nextracted (Eubank et al. 2004). Microsimulations can then make use of this syn-\nthetic social contact network to assess the efficacy of different strategies for\nepidemic mitigation.\nIn both the above scenarios, there is a need for a detailed disaggregated sim-\nulation as we cannot realistically obtain information about population-level\neffects otherwise. The simulations include a model of typical daily activities,\nbut these activity patterns are fixed (in the simplest case) and not responsive\nto changes in the social or physical environment. This lack of adaptiveness at\nthe individual level is what we point to when we say that these simulations lack\nbehaviors. In order to incorporate behaviors, we need to go beyond microsim-\nulation to agent-based simulations.\nThe broad distinction between microsimulation and agent-based (or multi-\nagent) simulation is that the latter contains agents. What distinguishes an agent\nfrom just a computer program? Franklin and Graesser (1997) addressed this\nvery question and defined an autonomous agent as \u201ca system situated within\nand a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over\ntime, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future.\u201d\nThere is thus an implication of teleology, or purpose, in the definition of agency.\nWhile this may appear to locate agency within an agent, they also recognize\nthe role of factors external to the agent in determining its agency. They note\nthat, \u201ca robot with only visual sensors in an environment without light is not\nan agent. Systems are agents or not with respect to some environment.\u201d In this\nsense, agency is also contingent, making it similar to Simon\u2019s (1996) definition\nof artificial systems.\nThis raises an important question from the simulation perspective: how much\nof agency is teleological, and how much is contingent? Put another way, how\nmuch of agency is individual or agent internal, and how much is determined\nby interaction? This is not just a matter of philosophical interest; it has impli-\ncations for the design and scalability of simulations. In a traffic simulation, for\ninstance, drivers may be modeled as sophisticated feedback controllers who\nadapt to traffic conditions, leading to different observed traffic flow regimes atDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Barrett et al. (1996) showed that such an adaptive\nfeedback control mechanism emerges from a much simpler computation in\na cellular automaton (CA) model of traffic, through the interactions between\nsimulated vehicles. There are, thus, two equivalent ways of designing traffic\nsimulations. The first is to develop a complex driver model for the agent and\nput many of these together to simulate traffic. The second is to use the CA\napproach, where the same driver model emerges from the interactions between\nthe CA rules and the interactions within the system. The two approaches are\nequivalent in terms of the global phenomena of interest, but the latter is a\nmuch more scalable approach in terms of the size of the system that can be\nsimulated.\nIt is in our interest, therefore, from the perspective of designing scalable sim-\nulations, to have the individual agents be as lightweight as possible in terms\nof their individual computational burden. If agent computations can be dis-\ntributed across interactions within the system, the simulation benefits by hav-\ning a smaller memory and processing footprint while still achieving the same\nglobal objectives, thus allowing scaling to much larger numbers of agents. Bar-\nrett et al. (2011) refer to this approach as unencapsulated agency. How to do\nthis in general, though, is an open question.\nOn the other hand, the reader might reasonably object, just because a com-\nplex behavior can emerge from interactions in a simpler simulation doesn\u2019t\nmean that that\u2019s how it works in the real world. The human brain is a mar-\nvelously complex system, and human decision-making is a subtle process, so it\ncould be supposed that locus of agency lies within the individual, and the idea\nthat agency emerges from interactions might seem counterintuitive.\nThis tension between the individual and the social or between agency and\nstructure (to use the sociological term) has long been recognized. Sewell (1992)\nreferred to agency as the efficacy of human action, and wrote that \u201ca social sci-\nence trapped in an unexamined metaphor of structure tends to reduce actors\nto cleverly programmed automatons.\u201d\nEmirbayer and Mische (1998) have a much more complex definition of\nagency: \u201cthe temporally constructed engagement by actors of different struc-\ntural environments \u2013 the temporal-relational contexts of action \u2013 which,\nthrough the interplay of habit, imagination, and judgment, both reproduces\nand transforms those structures in interactive response to the problems posed\nby changing historical situations.\u201d This bears unpacking.\nThey decompose agency into three elements, which they term iteration, pro-\njectivity, and practical evaluation. In their view, an agent structures its social\nenvironment and creates a stable identity and interactions by selectively reac-\ntivating prior patterns of thought and action. This is referred to as iteration.\nThe agent also generates possible future trajectories of action (projection) and\nchooses among them based on current circumstances as well as practical and\nnormative judgments (practical evaluation) (Emirbayer and Mische 1998).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n622 Simulation Analytics for Social and Behavioral Modeling\nAt first glance, this evokes the standard artificial intelligence concepts of\nlearning and planning where, broadly, the notion of iteration corresponds to\nlearning and projectivity and practical evaluation correspond to planning. It\nalso tracks Franklin and Graesser\u2019s definition of an agent, above, in the sense\nof being situated in a (structural) environment and acting upon it in pursuit of\nits own agenda to effect what it senses in the future. There are a couple\nof differences though. Emirbayer and Mische make a commitment to the\nmethods by which an agent acts. For instance, iteration is done by reactivating\nprior patterns of thought and action; projection is done by generating possible\nfuture trajectories. Franklin and Graesser allow for a broader definition since\nthey do not make similar commitments.\nA deeper difference, however, is that Emirbayer and Mische emphasize that\ntheir\u2019s is a fundamentally relational notion of agency. In their conception,\n\u201cagency [is] always agency toward something, by means of which actors enter\ninto relationship with surrounding persons, places, meanings, and events\u201d\n(Emirbayer and Mische 1998). While Franklin and Graesser also note the role\nof context in determining agency, Emirbayer and Mische treat interaction and\ncontext as central to their understanding of agency. Indeed, they treat the\nagent itself as a relational structure and write that, \u201cour perspective, in other\nwords, is relational all the way down\u201d (Emirbayer and Mische 1998).\nThis view has also been present in the philosophy of distributed artificial\nintelligence (DAI). Gasser (1991), in laying out a series of foundational prin-\nciples for DAI, gives the example of an industrialist flying from Tokyo to Los\nAngeles after initiating business negotiations in Tokyo and having called ahead\nto inform her associates in Los Angeles. Gasser points out that this industrial-\nist is simultaneously involved in multiple commitments, some of which are not\nin her control (like the plane landing in Los Angeles), which involve actions by\nmultiple participants in many places. Her agency, in effect, cannot be localized\nto her physical location, making her a distributed agent.\nWhat are the implications for our understanding of simulations? First, the\nabove discussion shows that unencapsulated agency is not just a means to\ndesigning scalable simulations. The non-localization of agency is a fundamen-\ntal property of agents in the real world. We need to treat this as a foundational\ndesign imperative for simulations.\nSecond, from a simulation analytics perspective, it suggests that what we\nget out of a simulation might be quite different from what goes in. As we\nclaimed earlier, our reason for building simulations is that we wish to calculate\npopulation-level outcomes from descriptions of individual behaviors and\ninteractions. However, the process of interaction causes the influence (and\nagency) of each agent to spread out through the population, making it tricky, to\nsay the least, to identify causality, or to determine effective interventions. We\ncan then ask the question in the opposite direction: given a simulation, how doDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

How do we identify the causal structures, and\nhow do we extract meaningful information?\nIf agency is understood to be relational, how do we understand structure?\nSewell (1992) builds upon the prior work of Giddens and Bourdieu to clarify the\nnotion of social structure and develop a theory of the means by which agents\nare not only constrained by structure but also able to effect structural change.\nHe develops the notions of schemas, which refer to the rules governing inter-\nactions among agents, and resources, which refer to material things that agents\ncan draw upon or use in their interactions. In his view, \u201cTo be an agent means to\nbe capable of exerting some degree of control over the social relations in which\none is enmeshed, which in turn implies the ability to transform those social\nrelations to some degree.\u201d\nSewell cites the analogy made by Giddens (1976), that the relationship of\nstructure to practice is like the relationship of langue to parole described by\nSaussure where, broadly, langue corresponds to grammar and parole to speech.\nIn Sewell\u2019s view, structure consists of both virtual things, the schemas, things\nlike norms, patterns of behavior, and roles, and material things, the resources,\nsuch as land, tools, and factories. He goes on to discuss how schemas and\nresources depend upon each other and how each produces the other. In pr\u00e9cis,\nhe defines structures to be \u201csets of mutually sustaining schemas and resources\nthat empower and constrain social action and that tend to be reproduced by\nthat social action\u201d (Sewell 1992).\nIn simulations, structure is provided by the rules of interaction, the affor-\ndances available to agents, and the internal computational models of agents.\nThis structure constrains agent behavior in the simulation. However, while this\nseems analogous to the langue/parole distinction, it doesn\u2019t actually reflect the\nidea of structuration that Sewell elaborates because in his view, crucially, struc-\ntures tend to be reproduced by social actions. That this is a tendency, and not\na rigid determinism, allows for the possibility of structural change. In a sim-\nulation, unless we allow for some kind of self-modifying code, the kinds of\nstructure mentioned above are not reproduced by the agents, nor is there any\npossibility of change to these structures through the actions of the agents. There\nis therefore an intermediate level of structure we must consider, which is the\nstructure that is emergent in a simulation. For example, the network structure\nof interactions and the rules of interaction, both of which might be fixed in\na simulation, can lead to the emergence of consensus or norms (Fagyal et al.\n2010), which is an emergent structure.\nFrom a simulation analytics perspective, the questions this raises have to\ndo with identifying emergent structures. What defines an emergent structure?\nHow do we formalize (intermediate) levels of structure? When do these struc-\ntures have causal power? Is it possible for emergent structures to have causal\npower that is more informative than the lower level structures that define theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These are fundamental questions and have been iden-\ntified (among others) as priority challenges by Davis et al. (2018).\nSimulation Analytics for Social and Behavioral Modeling\nWe present an example of a question for which we have developed a novel\nmethod to analyze simulation results. This is barely scratching the surface of\nthe problems in this space, but it shows how taking a simulation analytics per-\nspective allows finding new insights into outcomes of complex simulations.\nThis example is from a simulation (Barrett et al. 2013) of National Planning\nScenario 1, wherein a 10 kT improvised nuclear device is detonated at ground\nlevel in Washington, D.C., at approximately 11 a.m. on a weekday. Detailed\ncalculations have previously been done of the physical effects of this event,\nincluding the shock wave, the electromagnetic pulse, thermal fluence, radia-\ntion levels over time, and the resulting fallout cloud. The explosion will result\nin damage to the built infrastructure in the area around ground zero, including\npower loss, loss of communication, disruption of transportation (road dam-\nage), and building damage. Our simulation used information about all of these\neffects in combination with a detailed model of the population and expected\nbehaviors. The simulation modeled the aftermath of the event out to 48 hours\npost-event, keeping track of population health and mobility.\nIn this simulation, a synthetic population model of the Washington, D.C.,\nmetro area was used to create 730 833 agents, corresponding to an estimate of\nall the people expected to be in the area we studied at the time of the detonation.\nThe state of each agent was represented by a number of variables, including its\ndemographics, its household relationships, its current geographical location,\nits health state, and more. Each agent, at each time step, could choose to do\none or both of two actions: try to go somewhere and/or try to call someone.\nWhere the agent decided to go and whom the agent decided to call depended\non the agent\u2019s current behavior. We modeled six behaviors: household recon-\nstitution, shelter seeking, evacuation, healthcare seeking, worry, and aiding/\nassisting others. These behaviors were temporally extended. They were trig-\ngered in part by environmental conditions, in part by the health of the agent, in\npart by the information the agent had about family members, and in part prob-\nabilistically. The details of the behavior model are presented elsewhere (Parikh\net al. 2013, 2016a). For our current discussion, it is important to note two things:\nthat the agency of these actors, therefore, was distributed across the physical\nand social environment and that the behaviors were modeled at an intermedi-\nate level between the level of actual actions the agents perform and that of the\npopulation level outcomes that are observed.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

One of the outcomes we ultimately care about is the\ndistribution over health states at the end of the simulation, i.e. how many peo-\nple die, how many are injured, how many are in good health, etc.; health state in\nthe simulation was divided into eight discrete levels, with level 0 representing\ndeath, level 7 representing perfect health, and intermediate levels representing\ndifferent levels of injury/incapacitation.\nWe would like to know how behaviors (and other factors) affect health out-\ncomes. Some factors, such as the explosion itself, are obvious. The probability of\nsurvival within a half-mile radius of ground zero is very small. However, other\nfactors are not so clear cut. Does searching for family members help or hurt? Is\nit better to evacuate or shelter in place? There are several such questions. Below\nwe describe a method we have developed (Parikh et al. 2016b) to tease out the\ncausal influences on a given outcome of interest in a simulation. The method is\nbased on the causal state formalism that has been developed by Crutchfield and\nothers, termed computational mechanics (Crutchfield and Young 1989; Shalizi\nand Crutchfield 2001). We make use of the fact here, as discussed in the Intro-\nduction, that we have complete observability in a simulation, i.e. there are no\nmissing data or unmeasured influences on the outcomes.\nSuppose that we have a stochastic process, denoted by a sequence of random\nvariables Xt , drawn from a discrete alphabet, \ue22d. At time t, we write \u2190\u2212\nX to denote\nthe sequence X\u2212\u221e \u2026 Xt\u22122Xt\u22121Xt the past of the sequence, and \u2212\u2192\nX to denote the\nsequence Xt+1Xt+2 \u2026 X\u221e the future of the sequence, following Crutchfield et al.\n(2009) and Ellison et al. (2009).\nCrutchfield and Young (1989) came up with an elegant and simple method for\nmodeling the time series: group all the histories that predict the same future.\nThis gives rise to a state machine that they call an \ud835\udf16-machine, defined as (Ellison\net al. 2009):\n\ud835\udf16(\u2190\u2212x ) =\n{\u2190\u2212x \u2032| Pr(\u2212\u2192\nX |\u2190\u2212x ) = Pr(\u2212\u2192\nX |\u2190\u2212x \u2032 )\n}\n(26.1)\nThe states of this \ud835\udf16-machine correspond to groups of histories that assign the\nsame probability distribution to the future of the time series. They showed that\n\ud835\udf16-machines have some very interesting and useful properties. For example, \u2190\u2212\nX\nis statistically independent of \u2212\u2192\nX given the current causal state, which makes\nthe \ud835\udf16- machine process Markovian. \ud835\udf16-Machines are also optimally predictive\nbecause they capture all of the information \u2190\u2212\nX contains about \u2212\u2192\nX .\nAn algorithm for learning an \ud835\udf16-machine representation from a given time\nseries, known as Causal State Splitting Reconstruction (CSSR), was describedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n626 Simulation Analytics for Social and Behavioral Modeling\nby Shalizi and Shalizi (2004). Their approach is to learn a function that can\npredict the next step of the series optimally, a property they call next-step suffi-\nciency and that can be applied recursively. The idea is that if a function satisfies\nboth these properties, it can be used to compute the entire future of the time\nseries.\nCSSR operates incrementally to infer an \ud835\udf16-machine as a hidden Markov\nmodel (HMM) from a given time series. To start with, the HMM has just one\nhidden state. More states are added only when a statistical test shows that the\ncurrent set of states is insufficient for capturing all the information in the past\nof the time series.\nThe CSSR algorithm considers increasingly longer past sequences and com-\npares the distribution over the next symbol by doing a statistical test. If L is the\nlength of the past sequences evaluated so far and \u03a3 is the set of causal states\nestimated so far, then in the next step, CSSR looks at sequences of length L + 1.\nIf a sequence of the form ax L, where x L is a sequence of length L and a \u2208 \ue22d is a\nsymbol, belongs to the same causal state as xL, then we would have (Shalizi and\nShalizi 2004)\nPr(Xt |ax L) = Pr(Xt |\u0302S =\u0302 \ud835\udf16(x L)) (26.2)\nwhere\u0302 S is the current estimate of the causal state to which xL belongs. If\nthese two distributions are statistically significantly different according to\na statistical test such as the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, then CSSR tries to\nmatch the sequence axL with all the other causal states estimated so far.\nIf Pr(Xt |ax L) turns out to be significantly different in all cases, a new causal\nstate is created and ax L is assigned to it. This process is carried out up to some\nlength Lmax .\nOur approach adapts the causal state formalism to large multi-agent simula-\ntions. There are two key differences. First, CSSR relies on having a very long,\nstationary time series in order to be able to estimate the probability distribu-\ntions. Instead of having a very long time series, we rely on having a very large\nnumber of agents. Second, since our simulation is not a stationary process, we\nconstruct the optimal set of clusters at each time step, with respect to a final\noutcome, as explained below.\nIn our approach, a multi-agent simulation consists of a set of agents, each of\nwhich is defined by a k-dimensional state vector x(t) = [x1(t), x2(t), \u2026 , x k (t)]\u22ba,\nwhich evolves over time. Let di be the number of possible values x i can take. The\nsimulation proceeds in discrete time steps from t = 0 to t = T. Let the number\nof agents be denoted by N.\nWe use the term state in a broad sense. It can include, e.g. the action taken\nby the agent at each time step or how many other agents in the agent\u2019s neigh-\nborhood are doing the same action. It can also include historical aggregations\nof variables, e.g. it might include a variable that tracks if an agent has ever done\na particular action or the cumulative value of some variable so far.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Let the outcome variable for agent i be denoted by y i.\nWe assume that y i is an instance of a random variable Y . Our algorithm for\ndiscovering these causally relevant states proceeds as follows.\nWe divide the agent population into a set of clusters, C(t) = {C1(t) \u222a C2(t) \u222a\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Cm(t)}, at each time step. Initially, all the agents are grouped into just one\ncluster, i.e. m = 1 at t = 0. At each subsequent time step, the state of each agent\nchanges because at least one of x1, \u2026 , x k changes. The number of ways in which\nx can change is d = d1 \u00d7 d2 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 dk .\nConsider an arbitrary cluster of agents, Ci(t). At time step t + 1, it can split\ninto up to d groups, based on how each agent\u2019s state changes. However, not all of\nthese changes may have a significant impact on the outcome variable. We treat\neach group derived from Ci(t) as a candidate cluster, denoted by CCi,j(t + 1),\nwhere j \u2208 1 \u2026 d. At each step, we compare Pr(Y |Ci(t)) with Pr(Y |CCi,j(t + 1)\nusing the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test.\nOur null hypothesis (analogous to Eq. (26.2)) is\nPr(Y |CCi,j(t + 1)) = Pr(Y |Ci(t)) (26.3)\nWe also introduce a parameter \ud835\udeff, which is a threshold on the effect size, which\nwe measure as the Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL)-divergence between Pr(Y |Ci(t)) and\nPr(Y |CCi,j(t + 1). If the null hypothesis is rejected at a level \ud835\udefc (say 0.001) and\nDKL(Pr(Y |Ci(t))|| Pr(Y |CCi,j(t + 1)) > \ud835\udeff, then candidate cluster CCi,j(t + 1) is\naccepted as a new cluster at time step t + 1. The need for the effect size thresh-\nold is explained further below. If none of the candidate clusters at time step\nt + 1 are accepted, then Ci(t) is added to the set of clusters for time step t + 1.\nThus, the entire simulation is decomposed into a tree structure of agent clus-\nters. Furthermore, each cluster splits only when the corresponding state change\nis informative about the final outcome of concern. The trajectory of each agent\ntraces a path through this tree structure. We compress the trajectory by retain-\ning only those time steps at which the cluster to which the agent belongs splits\noff from its parent cluster. The parameter \ud835\udeff allows us to control how many new\nclusters are formed at each step and, consequently, how much compression of\ntrajectories we achieve. Setting \ud835\udeff to a high value will retain only the clusters\nthat have a large difference in outcomes from their parent clusters.\nThe resulting tree structure can then be queried to find information of inter-\nest. For instance, the query \u201cFor people who started between 0.6 and 1 mile from\nground zero, identify top 10 transitions where current health state remains the\nsame but the expected final health state is reduced, order by expected reduction\nin descending order\u201d gives the results shown in Table 26.1 (Parikh et al. 2016b).\nThe results pick out a combination of behaviors, time (iteration), health state,\nradiation exposure, and whether the agent has received an emergency broad-\ncast (EBR) advising to shelter in place, which has a high predictive value inDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

HC seeking is healthcare seeking. The causally relevant states,\ntherefore, are a combination of agency and structure. They are not designed\nto be this way; they emerge from the interactions in the simulation and are\nrevealed by taking a simulation analytics perspective.\nConclusion\nIsaac Asimov, in a collection of short stories that became the novel Foundation,\ninvented the idea of a science called psychohistory. This was a science that\nallowed forecasting the dynamics of large populations, through a combination\nof psychology, history, mathematics, and statistics. In his stories, the people\nwho used this science used a device called the Prime Radiant to project\nthe immensely complicated equations onto walls, annotate and revise the\nequations, and extrapolate them forward. They spent their lives in comparing\nthe predictions of the model with reality and in devising careful modifications\n(interventions) to the model in order to then steer human civilization in a\npreferred direction.\nThere are two points implicit here. One is the idea that forecasting accuracy\nis (supposedly) the ultimate measure of model quality. The other is that the use\nof the model is for control, i.e. for devising interventions that steer the system in\na preferred direction. These two goals are actually at odds with each other.

With such a model\nto study counterfactual scenarios, in order to determine the consequences of a\nplanned intervention, say, all we would have to do would be to feed the model\nwith different data corresponding to the scenario we wished to study and then\nrun the simulation to observe the outcomes. This approach treats the model and\nsimulation as a black box and concerns itself with just the inputs and outputs\nto the system.\nHowever, consider the problem of finding good interventions, given such a\nperfect model. While such a model would offer the affordances to study changes\nto any aspect of the real world, its complexity would be as much as the real\nworld, by the law of requisite variety (Ashby 1958; Bar-Yam 2004). Finding\ngood interventions requires understanding the causal processes in the system,\ni.e. opening up the black box, which would be very challenging with such a\ncomplex model. In other words, such a model would be very difficult to under-\nstand and use. In general, the more realistic a model becomes, the harder it is to\nwork with.\nHowever, even with a complex and realistic model, we retain the advantages\nof complete observability and complete knowledge of the computation being\ncarried out by each agent, along with the ability to rerun the simulation, as\ndiscussed in the Introduction. We do, however, need new simulation analytics\nmethods for sensemaking with such models.\nTaking a step back from this dichotomy, there are actually many reasons to\ndo modeling beyond forecasting and control (Epstein 2008), such as explain-\ning, generating new hypotheses, training practitioners, and more. Consider a\nquestion like, \u201chow many different types of agents do you have in your simula-\ntion?\u201d Generally, this question is asked from a design perspective, e.g. we might\nhave designed civilians and responders into a disaster simulation. However, this\nquestion is equally valid, and perhaps more meaningful, from a simulation ana-\nlytics perspective. Can we look at the outcome of the simulation and derive a\ntaxonomy of agents? We might discover that a finer-grained taxonomy is more\nmeaningful, e.g. the category of civilians might be further refined into those\nwho are seriously injured, those who are trying to evacuate, and those who are\nmoving toward the disaster area (to look for family members, for example). This\nkind of analysis would clearly help with a high-level understanding of the sim-\nulation, and with planning appropriate response procedures. This is just one\nexample of a range of new questions that open up when we take a simulation\nanalytics perspective. The key ideas about this perspective that we have tried\nto convey in this article are as follows:\n\u2022 Simulations allow us to compute population-level outcomes from complex\nindividual actions and interactions.\n\u2022 Large-scaled complex simulations constitute a new regime of investigation.\n\u2022 Behavior needs to be modeled and understood at a level that is intermediate\nbetween individual actions and population-level outcomes.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We term this general area simulation analytics.\nDiscovering interventions is one example.\nMore generally, our thesis can be summed up as follows: That which we\ncall behavior is a fundamentally distributed, interactionist, and emergent\nphenomenon. It arises from the interplay between agency and structure.\nSimulation analytics offers a means of studying it as such.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the members of the Network Dynamics and Simulation Science\nLaboratory for the many useful discussions over several years.

Since social norms have been\nshown to strongly affect health-related habits such as overeating, binge drink-\ning, and smoking, our simulation focuses on the social, rather than addictive,\nelements of the smoking cessation problem. Our lightweight normative archi-\ntecture (LNA) (Beheshti and Sukthankar 2014b) models the impact of personal,\nsocial, and environmental factors on recognition, adoption, and compliance\nwith campus smoking norms. When initialized with student survey data, it\naccurately predicts trends in smoking reduction over a one year timeframe.\nOne weakness with LNA is that it has a relatively simple internal model\nof the human decision-making process. To address this issue, we created a\ngeneral normative architecture, cognitive social learner (CSL) (Beheshti et al.\n2015), which is capable of reasoning about any social norm. CSL provides a\ncomputational mechanism for transitioning behaviors learned during repeated\nsocial interactions into the agent\u2019s internal cognitive model of preexisting\nbeliefs, desires, and intentions.

Nonnormative models of smoking behavior already exist; for instance,\nSimSmoke is one of the widely used tobacco control policy simulations. It\nmodels the dynamics of smoking use and smoking-attributed deaths in the\nsociety of interest, as well as the effects of policies on those outcomes (Levy\net al. 2005). Other types of simulations have been used to model the conse-\nquences of second-hand smoking (Dacunto et al. 2013). In addition to norms,\nour proposed approach also simulates network effects as was done in Beckman\net al.\u2019s (2011) study on the propagation of adolescent smoking behavior.\nMost existing models within the medical and public health community are\nbased on statistical analysis of smoking data (Luo et al. 2015). These methods\noften focus on a narrow aspect of the problem, such as modeling abstinence due\nto changes in brain cells. However, some models in the public health domain\nhave been based on system dynamics approaches (Timms et al. 2012). An intro-\nduction to this set of techniques can be seen in Homer and Hirsch (2006).\nThe relationship between social norms and smoking behavior was examined\nas part of a European Union study on the impact of cultural differences on\nthe emergence of norms in different countries after the commencement of\nanti-smoking legislation (Dechesne et al. 2013). Our current ABM does not\nattempt to recreate cultural effects. Rather than studying smoking cessation\nbehavior at the macroscopic level, we adopt a higher fidelity approach in\nwhich the daily behavior patterns of individual agents are simulated within an\nactivity-oriented microsimulation.\nLightweight Normative Architecture (LNA)\nTo construct a normative model for a real-world scenario, we need to define\nboth a norm architecture and the components that are used to recreate the\nreal-world problem.\nEach agent has a personal smoking value (SV) ranging from 0 to 100 that\ngoverns its behavior. As shown in Figure 27.1, our architecture contains three\n0 100\nRecognition Adoption ComplianceNormative architecture\nRange\nState Smoker Number of cigarettes\nsmoked/day Quit\nFigure 27.1 A schematic representation of the LNA architecture.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In the first stage (recognition),\nthe beliefs of an agent change and develop. During the adoption phase, the agent\ncommences action. Note that the general definition of adoption in normative\nsystems is very consistent with our smoking scenario. During the adoption\nphase the agent can opt to violate the norm. The equivalent violation in the\nsmoking scenario (recidivism) is quite common in those trying to quit. To quit\nsmoking, a smoker usually decreases the number of smoked cigarettes, which\ncan be considered as another adoption behavior. The compliance phase is used\nto simulate the time period when the agent seriously attempts to quit smoking.\nCognitive Social Learners (CSL) Architecture\nCSL adds an advanced structure of learning and reasoning about norms to the\nsimple decision-making process of the LNA architecture. Figure 27.2 shows a\nschematic view of CSL. In this architecture, the belief, desire, and intention\n(BDI) components implement the cognitive aspects of norm formation, while\nthe game-theoretic (GT) interaction and reinforcement learning (RL) recogni-\ntion parts implement the social aspects. CSL only models the rational and social\nelements of human health-related decisions; it meant to be a complement to\nexisting biological models of craving and dependency (Gutkin et al. 2006).\nThe representation used for the BDI components and the norms is based on\na simplified version of the framework introduced by Casali et al. (2008) and\nCriado et al. (2010b) in which a certainty degree is assigned to each representa-\ntion. For example, (D\u2212payfine, 0.45) designates a negative desire toward paying\na fine with a certainty degree of 0.45.\nBelief, Desire, and Intention\nThe CSL architecture follows a classic BDI structure. Like many normative\narchitectures, each agent is initialized with a set of personal values that model\ninnate preferences. In CSL, these personal values are used to create type 1\nFigure 27.2 Cognitive\nsocial learners (CSL)\narchitecture.

For instance, (B[smoking]botherRest, 0.30) indicates\nthat the agent believes, with certainty of 0.30, that smoking would bother the\nother agents.\nDesires can be determined independently or based on the agent\u2019s beliefs.\nDesires are represented as (D\u2217\ud835\udf11, \ud835\udeff), which models the positive or negative\n(\u2217 = {\u2212, +}) desire of an agent regarding state \ud835\udf11 with certainty of \ud835\udeff. An agent\nmay update its desires when its beliefs change. This process is shown in\nEq. (27.1); the certainty value of desire D is updated based on function f , which\nis a user-defined function:\n((D\u2217\ud835\udf11, \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11), (B[\ud835\udefc]\ud835\udf11, \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf19)) \u21d2 (D\u2217\ud835\udf11, f (\ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11 , \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf19)) (27.1)\nIntentions are derived from the set of positive desires, if they have a certainty\nvalue higher than sum of the certainty values of all negative desires relevant to\nthe intention. Equation (27.2) shows this:\n((D+\ud835\udf11i1 , \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11i1\n), \u2026 , (D+\ud835\udf11i n , \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11in\n), (planj, \ud835\udeffj))\n\u21d2 (Ik , f (\ud835\udeffi1 \u2026 \ud835\udeffi n , \ud835\udeffj)) (27.2)\nwhile \u03a3(\ud835\udeffi1 \u2026 \ud835\udeffi n ) \u2265 \u03a3(\ud835\udeffl1 \u2026 \ud835\udeffln ) and l1 to ln are indices of negative desires\ntoward effects of Ik . According to this formula, the set of positive desires (from\ni1 to in) and plan j will determine the intention k based on a user-defined\nfunction f . In the smoking case, an agent might have positive desires toward\nhigher happiness, conforming with smoker friends, but negative desires toward\nbecoming ill and being observed by others. In this case, if the sum of certainty\nvalues for happiness and consistency is more than the sum of certainty values\nfor becoming sick and being observed (assuming that smoking is part of the\nagent\u2019s current plan), the agent will smoke.\nGame-Theoretic Interaction\nInstead of deciding its actions based on intentions alone, which is often the\ncase in BDI-based methods, the agent\u2019s final action is determined after playing\na social dilemma game with (one of ) the other agents. The other agent could be a\nneighbor agent or a friend. The maximum certainty value of available intentions\nis used to create a two-by-two matrix. The two possible actions are performing\nor refraining from that action. After calculating the payoff value for an action\nbased on the related intentions, fixed values of \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd are used to increase\nthe value of the elements in the matrices representing coordinated action (the\nagent and its neighbor selecting the same actions) (Easley and Kleinberg 2010).\nAn example of this matrix for the smoking scenario is shown in Table 27.1. \ud835\udf13\nshows the computed payoff value for smoking. \ud835\udf13\u2032 is the payoff for not smoking.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

What an agent observes after performing an\naction may cause an agent to update its personal values (type 1 beliefs) and\nlearned norms, which in turn modifies its behavior in subsequent steps. For\ninstance, in the case of our example scenario, after smoking, if there is an adver-\ntisement in its vicinity, its value for the effect of advertisements will increase\nbecause of the formed habit.\nNorm Recognition Using RL\nThe goal of this component is to construct a practical way of recognizing/\nlearning norms while connecting different components of the architecture.\nOur RL-based recognition component plays the role of a hub among norms\nand personal values (beliefs) on the one hand and the GT interaction on the\nother hand.\nThe combination of GT interaction and RL-based recognition components is\nused to implement the social learning process, which propagates norms across\nthe agent population. The aim of the social learning framework is different\nfrom similar processes in the domain of multi-agent RL. In those the agents\nplay iterative games to learn a policy, resulting in a competitive or coopera-\ntive equilibrium. Sen and Airiau (2007) note several differences between social\nlearning and multi-agent RL, including the lack of equilibrium guarantees. At\nevery time step, each agent interacts with a single changing agent, selected at\nrandom, from the population. The payoff received by the CSL agent depends\nonly on this interaction. We use a basic Q-learning algorithm for recognizing\nnorms in which states are the discretized current values of an agent\u2019s payoff\nmatrices. Learning results in modifications to the certainty degree of available\nnorms. Rewards are calculated based on the changes in the personal values.\nNorms\nThe process of recognizing a social norm is modeled by an agent increasing\nthe norm\u2019s certainty value to a positive value. The agent updates the certainty\nvalues of norms based on its observations after performing an action. Our\nnorms are represented using the format introduced in Criado et al. (2013),\n\u27e8\u0394, C, A, E, S, R\u27e9, in which \u0394 designates the type of norm, C is the triggering\ncondition, A and E show the activation and expiration periods of the norm,Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For example, this is an example of\na possible norm: (\u27e8prohibition, smoking, \u2212, \u2212, payfine, \u2212\u27e9, \ud835\udeff), which is always\nvalid since there is no duration on activation, A, and expiration, E.\nAll of possible norms are initialized at the beginning of the simulation with\nthe certainty value of zero. Agents update their norms by increasing or decreas-\ning the certainty value of each norm after making an observation. For instance,\nif the agent receives a fine after smoking, it will update its current value of (\ud835\udeff)\nin the above norm example with (\ud835\udeff + \ud835\udf16), where \ud835\udf16 is a user-defined value.\nAn agent\u2019s current norms are used to update its beliefs and desires. The updat-\ning procedure is shown in Eqs. (27.3)\u2013(27.5). Here, norms are abbreviated as N\ninstead of \u27e8\u0394, C, A, E, S, R\u27e9. If there are any relevant rewards R (or sanctions S),\nthe positive desire D+ (or a negative desire D\u2212) will be updated. f functions are\nuser-defined functions:\n((Ni, \ud835\udeffN ), (B[\ud835\udefc]\ud835\udf11, \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf19)) \u21d2 (B[\ud835\udefc]\ud835\udf11, f (\ud835\udeffN , \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf19)) (27.3)\n((Ni, \ud835\udeffN ), (D+\ud835\udf11, \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11), R \u2260 \u2205) \u21d2 (D+\ud835\udf11, f (\ud835\udeffN , \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11)) (27.4)\n((Ni, \ud835\udeffN ), (D\u2212\ud835\udf11, \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11), S \u2260 \u2205) \u21d2 (D\u2212\ud835\udf11, f (\ud835\udeffN , \ud835\udeff \ud835\udf11)) (27.5)\nAs an example, if the norm (\u27e8prohibition, smoking, \u2212, \u2212, payfine, \u2212\u27e9, 0.75)\nexists and a negative desire toward paying fine (D\u2212payfine, 0.55), assuming the\nagent has just paid a fine for smoking (S \u2260 \u2205) with f = min(max(0.75, 0.55), 1),\nthe resulting updated desire would be (D\u2212payfine, 0.75).\nFigure 27.3 shows the pseudo-code describing an agent\u2019s behavior for one\ntime step in the CSL implementation.

Considering\nthe complex and challenging nature of modeling smoking behaviors, specifi-\ncally the addictive property of smoking, we tried to have an inclusive model\nthat contains as many factors as possible.\nPersonal\nOur model includes a set of personal values that are specific to each person\nand depend on their personality; Dechesne et al. (2013) use a similar set of\nvalues within their model of cultural differences that affect smoking behavior.\nAccording to the sociological theory of cultural value orientation introduced\nby Schwartz (2006), three types of values determine cultural differences in soci-\neties. These values are defined by three bipolar cultural dimensions that can be\nused to describe possible resolutions to problems confronting societies. In our\nmodel, we adopted two of these values since the third dimension is specifically\nfor cultural differences, which are negligible for our relatively homogeneous\nundergrad population. The two adopted values are described below:\n\u2022 Embeddedness vs. autonomy: This determines how much an individual\u2019s pref-\nerences, feelings, and ideas are affected by others through various relation-\nships vs. being cultivated internally.\n\u2022 Mastery vs. harmony: This refers to the dichotomy of being ambitious, dar-\ning, and self-assertive vs. being consistent, understanding, and appreciative\nof the environment.\nThe first item is referred as individualism (ind) and the second one as achieve-\nment (ach). The third item that is not included in our model is equality. In\naddition to these two personal values drawn from Schwartz\u2019s sociological (or\nanthropological) model, three other personal values are included:\n\u2022 Regret (rgt): In our scenario, this value shows how much the individual is\nregretful about smoking and is used to model the phenomenon of addiction.\nThe role of regret in smoking behaviors is described in Conner et al. (2006);\nit is related to their willingness to quit smoking or decrease their tobacco\nusage.\n\u2022 Health (hlt): As the name implies, this value shows the extent to which a\nperson is health conscious and pays attention to medical recommendations.\n\u2022 Hedonism (hdn): The pleasure-seeking aspect of one\u2019s personality. Health\nand hedonism were also used in a related study on smoking bans in European\nUnion countries (Dechesne et al. 2013).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n640 Using Agent-Based Models to Understand Health-Related Social Norms\nSocial\nThe second aspect of our model is used to quantify the effects of the community\non the individual. To do this, we create a synthetic friendship network for our\nsimulated community using the method described in Wang et al. (2011) for cre-\nating human networks that follow a power law degree distribution and possess\nhomophily, a greater number of link connections between similar nodes. The\nnetwork generator uses link density (ld) and homophily (dh) to govern network\nformation. For our smoking model, three elements are defined to determine the\nhomophily of a node: age, gender, and undergraduate major. The nodes of the\ngraph represent the individuals (agents) in the simulation.\nEnvironmental\nThe third category of factors that affect people\u2019s smoking behavior is what they\nobserve or encounter in their surroundings. Four items are considered in this\ncategory:\nOthers (oth): One major factor that affects norm compliance is observing other\npeople\u2019s behavior. Seeing other smokers can affect the agents\u2019 decisions to\nobey policies, particularly when complying with smoking cessation rules.\nSimilar behaviors in humans have been shown to exist and are usually\nreferred to as observational learning. Various studies have shown the effect\nof observation on smoking behaviors (e.g. Akers and Lee (1996)).\nSigns + butts (sbt): This item is specifically related to the effect of installed no\nsmoking signs that advise people to refrain from smoking. A key research\nchallenge here is to simulate the behavior of people in response to this type\nof notification. A recent study by Schultz et al. (2013) on littering in public\nlocations shows that people tend to obey installed signs when there is no\ntrash around the sign, but when litter exists in the vicinity, the rate of people\nwho do not follow the signs increases significantly. Using a similar approach,\nwe consider signs and cigarette butts together and model the influence of\nobserved cigarette butts on a person\u2019s on-campus smoking behavior.\nAdvertisements (adv): Physical advertisements can also influence smoking\nbehaviors. These advertisements are a major part of the campus smoke-free\nprogram. This category refers to tents, fliers, billboards, catalogs, posters,\nand banners installed permanently in different locations of campus.\nMiscellaneous (msc): This category encompasses all of the other factors that\nmight influence a smoker\u2019s decisions. One major aspect of this category\nis nonphysical influences, especially digital, educational, and promotional\nactivities. Also included in this category is the role of different cessation\nfacilities available on campus, such as workshops and nicotine replacement\ntherapy (NRT).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The\nmain SV is calculated using this formula:\nSV = (k1 \u2217 ind\u2032 + k2 \u2217 ach\u2032 + k3 \u2217 rgt + k4 \u2217 hlt\u2032 + k5 \u2217 hdn\n+ k6 \u2217 frd + k7 \u2217 oth + k8 \u2217 sbt + k9 \u2217 adv + k10 \u2217 msc) \u2215\n10\n\u2211\ni=1\nki\n(27.6)\nThe SV falls between 0 and 100. In this formula, k1 to k10 shows nine\ncoefficients that are assigned to the user. Prime (\u2032) means complement, which\nin this case is equal to 100 -. The friendship value (frd) is determined using the\nsocial model.\nAgent-Based Model\nThe original version of the ABM used in this work was built to study the\ntransportation patterns of people and vehicles (Beheshti and Sukthankar 2012,\n2014a). Before presenting the new components, we will first describe the\nfunction of the base ABM. The model was built to simulate the movement\npatterns of students at the University of Central Florida. The data for building\nthe model were gathered through an online survey. In the survey, partici-\npants were asked to answer questions about the time they arrive and depart\ncampus, locations they visit, and frequency of their visits. A set of statistical\ndistributions was fit to the answers of each question. These distributions were\nthen used to initialize the model parameters, including those that govern the\nactivities of an agent.\nEach agent arrives, visits locations on campus, and then leaves campus\naccording to its own personal schedule. Various specialized rules were added\nto the model to improve the verisimilitude of the whole system. Examples\nof defined rules include limitations on the number of cars that can enter a\nparking lot or the hours that shuttle services operate. The accuracy of the ABM\nwas measured in several different ways, including comparing the obtained\nstatistics from the ABM with other independently collected data sources.\nTo implement the smoking simulation scenario, the proposed smoking\nmodel was added to the original ABM. We added two parameters, age and\ngender, to each agent\u2019s parameter set to be used for measuring homophily in\nthe social model. Each agent is initialized as a smoker or nonsmoker at the\nstart of the ABM, based on the number of smokers in the survey data. The\nsmoke-free campus policy is assumed to be in effect immediately after the\nstart of the simulation.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The assumption\nis that each smoker agent smokes an average of 15 (for men) and 10 (for women)\ncigarettes per day. These numbers are based on the reported statistics in Burns\net al. (2003). The effect of observing others smoking on campus is incrementally\naggregated for each agent through the described RL algorithm. The observation\noccurs whenever an agent is close to an agent that is smoking at the same time.\nThe exact location of no smoking signs and physical advertisements is\ndefined in the campus map used in the ABM. Based on our observational\nstudy of the campus, cigarette butt locations are marked near the large college\nbuildings, but not general buildings like the student union and library. This\ntrend might occur because of the frequent cleaning of these areas or the\ntendency of people to avoid smoking in heavily crowded areas. While the agent\nmoves around campus, it passes physical advertisements. Similar to observing\nothers smoking, every encounter with an advertisement increases its chance\nof affecting the user.\nFigure 27.4 shows the user interface of the ABM. In this figure, the location\nof buildings, routes, and also the advertisements can be seen. The last item of\nthe environmental model (misc factors) is implemented by a random value that\nrepresents the aggregation of all other factors.\nLNA Setup\nHere, we describe the details of implementing smoking factors on the ABM that\nfollows the LNA architecture:\nPersonal: Personal values were added to the set of parameters possessed by each\nagent in the ABM. These values are calculated using distributions fitted to the\navailable survey data.\nSocial: To implement the diffusion of smoking behaviors in the friendship\nnetwork, a game-theoretic approach (Easley and Kleinberg 2010) is used.\nHere, a simple two-by-two matrix is defined that contains four different\nstates that can occur in the smoking scenario. Table 27.2 shows this matrix.\nThe descriptions below the table show how the payoffs are calculated. The\nabbreviations on the right side of the equations relate to being a smoker (s)\nor nonsmoker (n).\nTable 27.2 Payoff matrix governing the diffusion process in the friendship network.\nNode B\nSmoker Nonsmoker\nNode Smoker ss+\nss+\nsn\nns\nA Non-\nsmoker\nns\nsn\nnn+\nnn+\nss = ind + ach + hlt + hdn\nsn = ind + ach + hlt + hdn\nns = ind + ach + hlt + hdn\nnn = ind + ach + hlt + hdn\nPrime (\u2032) means complement, which in this case is equal to 100 -. ind, individualism; ach,\nachievement; hlt, health; hdn, hedonism.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The payoff for each of four\nentries of a node is calculated according to three factors: personal values, net-\nwork neighbors, and whether the subsequent state is similar to the current\nstate. Similar to the mechanism that was described earlier, \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd values are\nadded to the model to show the tendency of people to maintain their current\nstate. These two parameters are constant positive values that make the value\nof the payoff higher for the cases that the agent remains a smoker or non-\nsmoker than in the cases that a state transition occurs. The final value for the\nfriendship element of model (frd) is calculated based on the current state of\nthe individual and her friends, using the payoff matrix.\nEnvironmental: Each of the four elements is represented in the model with val-\nues ranging from 0 to 100. These factors are modeled as part of agents\u2019 beliefs\nfor the CSL architecture. For the implementation of environmental factors\non LNA architecture, a simplified version of Q-learning is used to govern the\neffects of the environmental factors. As Table 27.3 shows, when encounter-\ning an environmental factor such as a banner, the state of an agent is defined\nby the current value of its personal and social elements. The agent can either\nbe affected by the environmental factor or disregard it. In case of the first\naction, the value of that environmental factor will increase by a fixed amount,\nbut in the second case nothing changes. The reward that agent receives from\neach action is calculated based on three elements of its personal value vector:\nregret, health, and hedonism. The reward value falls between \u22121 and +1 and\nis calculated using the following formula:\nReward = (regret + health \u2212 2 \u2217 hedonism)\u2215200 (27.7)\nA dynamic learning schedule is utilized for the Q-learning, which results in\na higher rate of learning at the beginning of the simulation and a lower one\nafterward.\nCSL Setup\nHere we describe the elements of the CSL architecture:\nBeliefs, desires, and intentions: The two first personal values, individualism and\nachievement, are implemented as fixed value elements of beliefs (type 1).\nTable 27.3 Q-learning definitions for state, actions, and rewards.\nStates Current value of personal and social elements\nActions Pay attention or not\nRewards Calculated based on the values of regret, health. and hedonism\nIf the agent does not pay attention, it means that the agent opts to ignore a specific\nenvironmental element. Regret and health affects the reward value positively, and\nhedonism affects it negatively.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nData 645\nThe remaining three personal factors, regret, health, and hedonism, plus\nenvironmental factors are implemented as variables and part of each agent\u2019s\nbeliefs. The certainty values (\ud835\udeff) for beliefs and desires are assigned uniformly\nat random at the beginning of the scenario. The intentions are determined\naccording to Eq. (27.2). The main desires and intentions defined in this\nsystem refer to smoking and not smoking.\nPayoff matrices: An agent plays games with both its friends and other agents\nnear to it to determine its actions. For each action, an agent has a two-by-two\npayoff matrix that determines the agent\u2019s decision. The agent picks the inten-\ntion with the highest certainty value. The values of this payoff matrix are\ndetermined by the certainty degree of the selected intention. This means that\nin our architecture, the intentions do not directly determine agent\u2019s actions;\ninstead they define payoff matrix values. The friendship (frd) value in the\nsmoking model is calculated using the payoff matrix values.\nNorm recognition: The learning component is implemented using the\nQ-learning algorithm. Actions are the action performed by the agent: to\nsmoke or refrain. The reward value is assumed to be the same as the reward\nvalue defined for the RL and smoking diffusion in LNA. The current values\nof the payoff matrices determine the states of the Q-table. The selected\naction modifies the certainty value of norms. After an agent performs an\naction, it observes the consequences of its action to compute the overall\nreceived payoff, which is then used to update the Q-table.\nNorms: Norms are created using the same procedure introduced. Only\ndynamic (variable) parts of beliefs are updated. All possible norms are\ninitialized as having a certainty value of zero. During initialization, we create\nall of possible norm combinations based on the introduced norm repre-\nsentation: \u27e8\u0394, C, A, E, S, R\u27e9. The type of norm and its reward or sanction\nnature can be determined by the value for C. We assume that all norms are\nalways valid during the experiment, so we do not need to take A and E into\naccount. Thus 12 possible norms are defined for this scenario: \u2223obligation,\nprohibition, permission\u2223*\u2223smoking, not smoking\u2223*\u2223reward, sanction\u2223.\nData\nOur ABM uses data from three surveys of UCF students. In spring 2012, we\ndid an online survey of 1003 students to collect the data used to model campus\ntransportation patterns. The other two surveys were conducted by health ser-\nvices; one of them was done in fall 2011, before the smoke-free policy was insti-\ntuted, and the second in fall 2012, at the end of the first year of the smoke-free\ncampus.

The personal values and corresponding survey questions are as follows:\n\u2022 Individualism: Do you think breathing smoke-free air on campus is a right?\n\u2022 Hedonism: Do you think smokers have the right to smoke on campus?\n\u2022 Achievement: Would you feel comfortable asking someone to put out their\ncigarette?\n\u2022 Health: Would a smoke-free campus policy make campus healthier?\n\u2022 Regret: If you smoke, are you interested in attending a smoking cessation\nprogram?\nThe questionnaire was designed using a Likert scale. The personal values\nin our work were matched to questions after the survey was conducted, and\nnormal distributions fitted to the data were used to initialize the agents\u2019 per-\nsonal values in the ABM. The university administration used the answers to the\nfollowing three questions to determine the success of the smoke-free campus\npolicy. In our work, the answers to the second and last questions were used to\nshow the accuracy of the proposed model. These three questions are as follows:\n\u2022 Do you support the campus smoke-free policy?\n\u2022 Do you smoke?\n\u2022 Are you likely to take smoking cessation classes?\nThe other data used to implement the model, including the location of adver-\ntisements and installed no smoking signs, were obtained from campus sources.\nExperiments\nValidation is a major challenge while evaluating ABMs \u2013 how to show that the\nmodel matches reality. One approach is to evaluate the model by comparing\nthe statistics obtained from the model with other sources of data as indicators\nof ground truth. Here, the data obtained from the second and third questions\nof the survey described in the previous section are used to evaluate the model.\nThese two questions show the percentage of smokers among the students\nand also the percentage of those who are willing to attend smoke cessation\nworkshops.\nThe ABM is initialized with the same number of smokers and people will-\ning to participate in smoking cessation classes as indicated in the survey data. 1\nAccording to our definition, a smoker is an agent whose SV is below the quitting\nthreshold. Similarly, we use the middle part of the proposed SV range to iden-\ntify an agent who is willing to attend smoking classes.

The\nassumption is that the adoption phase in the proposed architecture shows the\nsituation where the agent has not reached the compliance phase. So, assum-\ning that an agent in the compliance mode is willing to attend smoking classes\nis consistent with the proposed architecture, because attending class is not a\nclear quitting task, but is a behavior toward quitting (the action phase).\nTable 27.4 shows the parameters that are used in the experiments to deter-\nmine the smoking range. As the table shows, the value 50 is used for the first\nthreshold, and 90 for the second threshold shown in Figure 27.1. In our exper-\niments, the values for the coefficients k3 , k4 , and k6 in Eq. (27.6) were 3, 3,\nand 2. The other coefficients were equal to 1. In the next section, a set sensitiv-\nity analysis experiments related to these values are presented. For the network\ngeneration part, the values for the link density, ld, and homophily, dh, were 0.40\nand 0.66.\nIn addition to the LNA and CSL architectures, we have also implemented the\nnorm\u2013belief\u2013desire\u2013intention (NBDI) architecture (Criado et al. 2010a). The\nNBDI benchmark does not play the social dilemma game and does not use RL\nto generate and update norms. In this case, intentions determine actions, and\nthen the norms are updated based on the feedback received from the environ-\nment. Note that the way that the norm representation was implemented (by\nmodifying the certainty value of norms) is not part of the original version of\nNBDI. The norm recognition part in the original NBDI was assumed to work as\na black box, and there was insufficient detail about its implementation to recre-\nate it. Hence we simply used the same norm recognition structure for both CSL\nand NBDI.\nResults\nUsing these assumptions, we ran our agent-based simulation for a period of\na year from fall 2011 to fall 2013. In these experiments, we initialized the\nsimulation with the same number of smokers and students willing to go to the\nclasses as the initial survey data and then compared the numbers obtained\nfrom the simulation with the final survey data. During this period, the agents\ncommute to campus and follow schedules governed by the transportation\nmodel.

Simulation error refers to the difference\nbetween the values obtained from each method and the real value from the\nexperimental data. The two measures shown here are the percentage of smoker\nstudents and the percentage of smoker students who are willing to attend\nsmoking cessation classes. The empirical data for the percentage of smokers\nwas also available for 2013.\nFigure 27.5 shows the comparison between the number of students who were\nsmokers and students willing to participate in smoking cessation classes. The\nperformance of CSL at predicting the actual adoption of the smoking cessation\nnorm is comparable with the specialized smoking model (LNA) and superior\nto NBDI.\nA powerful feature of ABMs is their potential ability of predicting future\ntrends, which is not possible if past data is not representative of future data.\nThis can be a great tool for policy-makers who want to analyze the effects of\nmodifying various parameters of a specific model. In Figure 27.6, the predicted\npercentage of smokers for the period of the years 2011\u20132016 is shown. The val-\nues shown for the years 2011\u20132013 are the same as Figure 27.5. Both models\nslightly overpredict the number of smokers identified using the UCF Health\nServices survey data, with CSL being slightly more accurate. For the year 2013,\nit was confirmed by the health services department that the reported rate (3.9%)\nseems a bit lower than what they were expecting based on national and state\naverages. One possibility is that smoking behavior is underreported by the stu-\ndents or being supplanted by vaping.

This phenomenon is\nreported in many smoking studies including ((Dotinga et al. 2005; Hammond\net al. 2006)) as occurring when smoking bans exist in human cities. Brown et al.\n(2005) showed that perceived social acceptability of smoking among referent\ngroups is independently associated with both strength of intention to quit and\nactual quitting behavior.\nIn our smoking model, it is assumed that an agent has the intention to quit\nsmoking if its SV is within the first and second threshold values. The social\nunacceptability of smoking across the population of agents is determined using\nthe value for one of the agent\u2019s personal characteristics (IND). The value of\nthis factor was initialized based on data from a survey question asking whether\nthe participant believes smoking is acceptable on campus. A linear regression\nmodel was used to examine the relationship between these two elements, and\nthe standard coefficient (beta) value of the applied linear regression is shown\nin Table 27.5. The CSL model produces a positive beta value, which is consis-\ntent with the real-world data. This shows that, using CSL, agents are able to\nreason about the socially perceived unacceptability of smoking behavior and\nmodify their behaviors accordingly.

Since our models include\na number of variables that could directly affect the final behavior of our system,\nthe sensitivity analysis illuminates the effect that each variable can have on the\nfinal outcome. Five of the ten coefficients (Eq. (27.6)) plus the two threshold val-\nues for determining the three stages of norm formation (Figure 27.1) are used as\nthe independent variables in our sensitivity analysis model. The remaining five\ncoefficients are not shown due to their close relation to the current coefficients.\nThe analysis is performed on one independent value at a time.\nFigure 27.7 shows the range of output values for different values that can\nbe assigned to five of the ki coefficients, and similarly Figure 27.8 shows the\noutput range for the two threshold values. By comparing the results shown in\nFigure 27.7a with 27.7b, and also 27.8a with 27.8b, we can observe that LNA\nseems to be more sensitive to noise than CSL. By changing the coefficient val-\nues from 0 to 6, the maximum change in the percentage of smokers is close to 4\nfor LNA and less than 2 for CSL. In the case of the two threshold values (shown\nin Figure 27.8), LNA\u2019s results vary in the range of 3.5, while the length of CSL\u2019s\nrange is less than 2.5. Overall, the sensitivity of the model\u2019s output to the set\nof input values is low, and because of type of equation that we proposed, the\noutput range for different values remains linear.\nWe also study ablated versions of the model that lack one of the three smok-\ning elements (social, environmental, or personal).

On the other hand, CSL represents a group\nof architectures that employ more complex structures for normative rea-\nsoning. CSL integrates internal cognitive structures with social interaction\nmechanisms. Our results demonstrate that CSL provides a richer model of\nhealth-related social norms. Specifically, when it comes to modeling the intri-\ncacies of humans\u2019 behaviors \u2013 like the correlation between the unacceptability\nof smoking in a society and quitting intention \u2013 our LNA exhibits a greater\nsensitivity to design assumptions and produces a lower fidelity model than CSL.\nConclusion\nIn this chapter, we introduced two architectures (LNA and CSL) for model-\ning the emergence of norms in ABMs. Our proposed normative architectures\nfocus on the impact of social factors on smoking behavior and are intended to\ncomplement biological models of the effects of nicotine addiction. We examine\nthe effect of a richer reasoning model on the overall performance of a model\nin understanding human behavior. Although both methods demonstrate good\nprediction abilities at the population level, the agents with more advanced cog-\nnitive and learning structures exhibit a higher level of verisimilitude in simu-\nlating human behavior. This was a gratifying result because we expect ABM to\nhave this potential. At the same time, results are driven by estimates of a num-\nber of parameter values, and more data is needed to permit developing better\nmethods for making such estimates and then updating them as additional infor-\nmation comes in. Doing so would be akin to what statisticians do, but we would\nanticipate results to be much better with the cognitive and learning structures\nof the ABM.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported by NSF IIS-08451 and DARPA HR001117S0018-\nSocialSim-FP-026.\nReferences\nAkers, R.L. and Lee, G.

What follows is a sum-\nmary of the ACSES effort that will be both the basis and the point of reference\nfor the subsequent discussion.\nACSES\nThe ACSES was a pilot model designed to help a research team evaluate\nthe possibility of creating a computational social science laboratory. The\nexample used to motivate model development was the question of \u201cpopulation\nallegiance in Afghanistan in the face of the Taliban insurgency, and effort\nby the Afghan government and coalition forces to combat the insurgency\u201d\n(Whitmeyer 2013). The purpose in building ACSES was to \u201cdemonstrate that a\nuseful ABM model could be built that would: 1) explain or predict a population\noutcome of interest to policy-makers and strategists, 2) make use of data of var-\nious kinds, 3) be testable with real-world data and perform well at prediction,\nand 4) implement different social theories so that the efficacy of the theories\ncould be tested. The population outcome of principal interest in the ACSES\nmodel is citizen allegiance, i.e., the number of citizens supporting the Taliban,\nsupporting the government, or being neutral\u201d (Whitmeyer 2013). The model\nproduces the geographical distribution of citizen allegiance. Below, we discuss\nthe structure of the model and the social-behavioral theories it incorporates.\nThe model has four kinds of agents: Taliban insurgents, coalition forces, gov-\nernment forces, and citizens. The model implicitly represents ethnic leaders\nthrough user-specified allegiance-related orders and leader characteristics,\nwhich then affect the citizens\u2019 allegiance: \u201cThe model incorporates data about\nthe geographic distribution of population, ethnic groups, and economic\nstatus. The option exists to calibrate and test the model by comparing model\npredictions with actual data about violent events in one district of Afghanistan\nover a three-year span in the 2000s. Model calibration consists principally of\nchoosing the social theory that does best at reproducing the empirical pattern\nof violence as functions of the above. The model incorporates social theories\nin such a way as to allow a continuum of different possibilities. To facilitate our\nanalyses, however, we specified 12 distinct theories. In addition, we built into\nthe model four theories of how actors, over time, may change in characteristics\nimportant for the social theories\u201d (Whitmeyer 2013).\nThe ACSES model demonstrates that agent-based models can be useful in\nexplaining or predicting citizens\u2019 allegiances and some consequences in situ-\nations of insurgency. Here are sample questions (from Whitmeyer 2013) that\nACSES may help answer in case, say, that the Taliban would mount an offensive\nin a specific region of Afghanistan:\n(1) How many citizens in the region initially support the Taliban?\n(2) How are the allegiance of citizens, their ideology, and their support for the\ndifferent factions likely to change over time?Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These theories can range across three\nlevels: individual action, social effects of aggregating individuals, and psycho-\nlogical change within individuals. Consequently, ACSES can answer questions\nsuch as (Whitmeyer 2013):\n(1) Do different social theories produce qualitatively different results (e.g. the\nanswers to questions 1\u20137 above)?\n(2) Do theories at different levels combine to produce new results?\n(3) Are the effects of combining theories, whether within or across levels, lin-\near or nonlinear?\nThe ACSES simulation includes models of the citizen agents at two levels and\ntime scales. One model is at the behavioral level and instantiates social theories\nthat explain allegiance. The theories of allegiance are implemented via a utility\nfunction for the citizen agents. The other model changes variables in the utility\nfunction and instantiates theories concerning psychological change.\nThe Social Theories\nIn social science, the word theory typically refers to a hypothesis or set of\nhypotheses about some relatively narrow category of phenomena. 1 The theory\nmay imply behavioral priorities, i.e. an ordering of behavioral preferences.\nThe key mechanism in the ACSES model that allows implementation of\nsocial theories is the utility function. For each considered behavior, the utility\nfunction combines the states of the agent on any number of variables into a\nsingle quantity, labeled utility. Each agent then chooses the behavior with the\ngreatest utility for the next time step. Many different mathematical forms of\nutility functions exist, with somewhat different mathematical properties. The\nACSES model employs the commonly used Cobb\u2013Douglas utility function,\nwhich specifies utility as the product of preferences raised to a fractional\npower.\n1 Note that this is a different usage than in the natural sciences. It is as if physics referred to mass\ntheory, friction theory, resistance theory, and so on. Instantiating many social science theories in\none model, as with the utility function here, shows they share a common theoretical framework.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Two different kinds of social influence may\naffect citizen allegiance as well. An obedience theory may be tempered by one\nor both social influence theories.\nThe utility function (shown below) permits a continuum of preference com-\nbinations to affect an agent\u2019s behavior. In the ACSES model, specific preference\ncombinations are used that correspond most closely to important theories of\nallegiance in the social science literature. If other theories involving only the\npreferences incorporated in the ACSES model are identified, ACSES may be\nable to accommodate them immediately. For theories involving preferences not\nin the ACSES model, the modular nature of the Cobb\u2013Douglas utility function\nwould make adding the necessary preferences relatively straightforward.\nThe ACSES utility function incorporates seven variables likely to affect a citi-\nzen agent\u2019s allegiance choice. Five of these are measures of an agent\u2019s nonso-\ncial environment or its position vis-\u00e0-vis its leader: the agent\u2019s loyalty to its\nleader (L), its economic situation (E), its security situation (V ), its ideological\nposition (I), and the coercive resources wielded by its leader (C). The other two\nvariables measure aspects of the agent\u2019s social environment: the allegiance posi-\ntion of the agent\u2019s close associates (F) and absence of repression, a combination\nof high collective action in the vicinity and little activity to counter it (R).\nThe following equation gives the specific version of the Cobb\u2013Douglas utility\nfunction that is used in ACSES:\nU = (1 \u2212 L)wL (1 \u2212 C)wC (1 \u2212 I)wI (1 \u2212 E)wE (1 \u2212 V )wV (1 \u2212 F)wF (1 \u2212 R)wR\nwhere U is the utility of a behavior and the seven variables, L, C, I, E, V , F, and\nR, are the deviations from the agent\u2019s ideal state (the state of maximum util-\nity) for each of these preferences or motivations, all measured on a 0\u20131 scale.\nThe weights determine the relative effect of the different preferences on U and,\ntherefore, characterize their relative importance to the agent.2 Different weight\nsettings correspond to different social theories, as described below. Briefly not-\ning some properties of the Cobb\u2013Douglas function, a weight of zero means the\nfactor takes the value 1 regardless of the state of the agent, i.e. the preference\nhas no effect. Fixing the weight for a given preference, the agent\u2019s utility is max-\nimal when the variable is 0, that is, the agent is at its ideal state with respect to\nthat preference. Variables are allowed to approach 1, maximal deviation from\nideal, but never to attain 1, because if one variable did, the agent\u2019s utility would\nbe 0 regardless of other preferences.\nThe ACSES model determines allegiance choice for an agent in a given situ-\nation for a given setting of the parameters w, then, by calculating U for three\n2 They are called weights because the logarithm of utility is a sum of terms in which the w\u2019s are\nweights in the normal sense.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The choice is whichever yields the highest\nutility U.\nThe three obedience theories specifically identified in ACSES are alternative\nhypotheses about the effects of a leader\u2019s order concerning its followers\u2019 alle-\ngiances. Legitimacy theory states that citizen agents want to follow the orders\nof the leader if they consider him or her legitimate. This theory is operational-\nized, therefore, by emphasizing the loyalty component of the utility function,\ni.e. setting w L to be large. The coercion theory posits that citizen agents follow\nthe orders of the leader to the extent that they believe that they will be rewarded\nfor doing so and punished for not. This theory is operationalized by setting w C\nto be large. The representative theory suggests that citizen agents follow the\nleader only to the extent that the leader advocates what the citizen agents want\nhim or her to advocate. Essentially, this means that the citizen agents choose\nallegiance based on other important characteristics of their situation, the ones\nincluded in ACSES being their ideology, their economic situation, and their\nsecurity situation. Thus, for this theory w I , w E, and w V will be large.\nThe two social influence theories specified in the ACSES model are hypothe-\nses about the effects of social influence on participation in collective action.\nSocial influence theory posits that a citizen agent is more likely to join a collec-\ntive action if more immediate friends do. The resistance to repression theory\nencompasses two balancing effects: (i) citizen agents are not likely to join a col-\nlective action if there are strong repressive forces around them, and (ii) citizen\nagents are more likely to join a collective action if a larger segment of the pop-\nulation is engaged in the action. In the ACSES situation, joining a collective\naction means taking the group\u2019s allegiance position. Resistance to repression is\ntaken into account only for citizen agents who are considering helping the weak\nside in their neighborhood. Given a high setting of w R, citizen agents are less\nlikely to confront factions that have a relatively strong presence in their neigh-\nborhood, especially when that faction has little support among other citizens\nin the neighborhood. This theory was deemed relevant and included due to the\ncircumstances of Afghanistan in the midst of the Taliban insurgency. Note that\nthese two theories (social influence and resistance to repression) can be used in\nconjunction with each other and with an obedience theory, but they will nec-\nessarily temper the obedience theory, in the sense that the more some kind of\nsocial influence matters, the less the obedience considerations will matter.\nTable 28.1 summarizes the five theories or hypotheses of citizen allegiance\nspecified in the ACSES model out of the available range of preference combina-\ntions. Domain refers to the variables emphasized in the theory, that is, whether\nthey concern a leader or whether they concern an agent\u2019s social environment.\nThe emphasis is achieved through noted settings of the parameters w.\nFigure 28.1 below presents a schematic diagram of a citizen agent\u2019s allegiance\nchoice in the ACSES model, as it has been described above.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Shading indicates the\nportion of the model relating to obedience theories. The unshaded region refers to the\nsecurity and absence-of-repression portions.\nThe specific theories or hypotheses realized in ACSES were drawn from liter-\nature in the social sciences concerning political allegiance (Whitmeyer 2013).\nThis literature is, as described in the overview chapter of this volume (Davis\nand O\u2019Mahony 2019), fragmented. Taken individually, the theories are arguably\nrather simplistic because it is likely that many factors matter. The ACES frame-\nwork and its Cobb\u2013Douglas utility function, however, allows for a continuum\nof parameter settings, as noted above, and for experimentation with composite\ntheories, as well as for the addition of new variables. Thus, ACSES can be used\nto investigate new theories of citizen allegiance or \u2013 given enough data \u2013 to\ndiscover superior combinations of variables, that is, combinations and weight-\nings of parameters that correspond to no known named theory.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Some of the variables reflect the agent\u2019s external conditions, such as\neconomics and security. Of the seven components of the utility function, two,\nhowever, concern variables that are largely internal to the agent. These are loy-\nalty to the leader and ideology (indicating which side of conflict most closely\nreflects the agent\u2019s beliefs).\nTo accommodate the possibility of these internal variables changing\nover time, ACSES incorporates four theories of psychological change, labeled\n(i) cognitive dissonance, (ii) results based, (iii) homophily, and (iv) socialization\n(Whitmeyer 2013). Cognitive dissonance increases the perceived legitimacy\nof the leadership if the chosen behavior coincides with the leadership\u2019s orders\nand lowers it if it does not. The result-based mechanism is based on a measure\nof the agent\u2019s welfare comprising the agent\u2019s economic situation and security\nsituation. The perceived legitimacy of the leadership is adjusted according to\nthe agent\u2019s welfare improvement (or lack of it) over the previous simulation\niteration. Homophily adjusts a citizen agent\u2019s perception of the legitimacy of\nthe leadership to become more similar to the perception of nearby agents of\nthe same type. Socialization assumes the citizen agent acquires his or her belief\nin the leadership\u2019s legitimacy at some point in the past, and it does not change\nafter that. The name comes from the long-standing sociological idea that as\nchildren, people are socialized into the beliefs they will retain throughout their\nlives (Durkheim 1982 [1895]). Thus, the socialization mechanism is the default\npsychological change theory if no other theory is invoked. The same four\ntheories of psychological change can be applied to a citizen agent\u2019s ideology.\nSummary\nTo summarize, then, ACSES simulates the choice of one behavior (allegiance\nto the government) and of one class of actor (citizen agents) in the context of\nAfghanistan during the Taliban insurgency and allows the use and testing of\nsocial theories or hypotheses concerning allegiance by implementing them via a\nCobb\u2013Douglas utility function. The utility function involves seven preferences\nthat allow agents\u2019 allegiance choices to be affected by external conditions, such\nas security, leaders\u2019 orders, and friends\u2019 choices, and internal states, such as\npersonal ideology. Because some of the internal states of agents may change\nover time, ACSES also includes alternative theories of adaptation. Let us now\nturn to how such a model can be verified and validated.\nVerification and Validation\nThe question in this section is how one should go about verifying and validating\nagent-based models that simulate real-life complex situations. Many authorsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Leigh Tesfatsion maintains\na website that offers a comprehensive treatment of this subject, including ref-\nerences (Tesfatsion 2017). Another chapter in this volume also discusses broad\nissues of V&V (Volkova et al. 2019).\nIn this chapter, we discuss some particular V&V issues in agent-based mod-\neling rather than attempting something more comprehensive.\nAdding to the complexity of V&V is the fact that models are designed with\ndifferent functions in mind. The overview chapter of this volume (Davis and\nO\u2019Mahony 2019) distinguishes among validation for description, explanation,\npostdiction, exploratory analysis (and coarse prediction), and prediction\nfunctions of the model. This chapter does not address those issues, but its\nobservations and suggestions are probably relevant to each of these classes of\nvalidation.\nBefore proceeding with methods for V&V, it is worth noting the magnitude\nof the V&V challenge if we want to test the model comprehensively. ACSES has\n144 different combinations of social theories, the result of having nine behav-\nioral theories, each of which can have any of four theories of change in perceived\nleadership legitimacy or any of four theories of change in ideology. Also, the\nrelative weights of the seven elements in the utility function can be set to any\nvalues between 0 and 1 as long as they sum to 1. Thus, two or more of the\nobedience theories can be combined, by averaging the weights, or entirely new\ntheories involving these preferences or motivations can be implemented. In a\nsense, then, a continuum of obedience theories concerning allegiance can be\nimplemented. Lastly it is straightforward, although requiring a bit more work,\nto add a new motivation or preference to the utility function. This may be nec-\nessary to implement some alternative behavioral theory not considered for the\nACSES model, especially if the target behavior is changed from citizen alle-\ngiance to something else.\nIn general, an agent-based model can be in any number of states within a\nhigh-dimensional space defined by agent attributes, rules of engagement, and\nspatial movements. In addition, randomness is used often in the model to avoid\nintroducing unnecessary bias into the system/model. Consequently, the search\nspace for agents in an agent-based model is prohibitively large for any realistic\nproblem. This problem of large search spaces is exacerbated by the fact that\nsituations modeled by agents are often rare, unique, complicated, and complex.\nSo, there are not many such situations to use for empirical assessment of the\nperformance of agent-based models. For example, we have not seen hundreds\nor thousands of wars in Afghanistan of the kind that resulted in the removal ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

There was only one such a\nwar. Therefore, machine learning methods are not very useful here.\nWith this sobering background of difficulties, let us now consider some meth-\nods that can be brought to bear.\nVerification\nIn general, verification refers to assuring that the program does what the pro-\ngram designer intended it to do. Methods from software engineering can be\nvery useful. Software verification in software engineering usually comprises\nstatic and dynamic verification methods. Static methods check the code before\nit runs, checking for adherence to code conventions, detecting bad practices,\nand calculating various software metrics associated with code quality and \u2013 if\na specification exists \u2013 more formal verification. Dynamic verification is good\nfor finding faults, also known as software bugs. This chapter focuses mostly\non V&V issues specific to agent-based modeling. It takes for granted that the\nmodeling and programming has been done professionally and with good prac-\ntices (e.g. along-the-way modular testing). If not, verification testing later will\nprobably be frustrating and perhaps hopeless.\nGiven the huge space of an ABM\u2019s possible states, modelers cannot systemat-\nically traverse the model instantiations through all the stages to see if the model\narrives at a given end state through a verifiably appropriate sequence of steps.\nBased on long experience and the specific experience of the ACSES project, we\nhighlight the following methods:\n\u2022 Visualization: Although informal, this verification method is still the easiest\nand most frequently used. It is strongly recommended. By using visualiza-\ntion, the modeler can verify whether agents move in the plausible direction,\ncover the appropriate distance, cluster as expected or possible, change color\nas expected, or get born or disappear as intended. Also, as the model per-\nforms over time, it becomes clear whether specific runs end too early, never\nend, produce nonsense outcomes, or do not produce expected variability. In\npractice, a great many small bugs introduce visible irregularities.\n\u2022 Charts: Unlike visualizations that show dynamic movement of agents over\ntime, charts show how each key variable changes its value over time. Charts\ncan quickly indicate irregular behavior, especially when paired with other\nvariables that are expected to correlate with it (or not).\n\u2022 Gradual implementation: It is beneficial to start with a minimal model and\nadd additional variables and features only after the existing ones are thor-\noughly verified.\n\u2022 Tracing: It is also useful to have a trace of the state of a set of randomly\nselected agents as they act and move in time as part of the model run. Each\nstate of such agents at each tick should be evaluated in the context of the\nagent\u2019s neighborhood.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n664 Lessons from a Project on Agent-Based Modeling\n\u2022 Exploratory analysis: Ideally, the modelers should run a system with every\npossible combination of starting conditions, including a sweep of values\nfor agent attributes, their rules of behavior, and ways of spatial movement.\nThis will provide a distribution of outcomes for the dependent variables as\na function of initial values for independent variables. Due to combinatorial\nexplosion, it will often be necessary to settle for a careful sampling of the\nfull space.\nValidation\nValidation is a completely different challenge. Once the model is reasonably\nverified, the next step is to validate it by making sure that the system reason-\nably accurately models the phenomenon under consideration for the purposes\nintended for the model. In the case of ACSES, we had to resort to finding a\nspecific situation that happened on the ground to see if the model was accu-\nrately comparing three social science theories that were competing for the best\nexplanation of the real-life events of interest. In general, the range of valida-\ntion techniques that would be meaningful in the context of a model like ACSES\nmight include:\n\u2022 Distribution of possible futures: This method is useful when we have the\ndistribution of values for each input variable. Starting the system with\nknown initial conditions, proposed rules of behavior, and spatial movement\nof agents allows the modeler to anticipate the final state of the system after\nsome period of time. Of course, different allocations of values to input\nvariables, based on the known distribution of values for each input variable,\nmay result in a different system outcome. Let us say that we are interested\nonly in two output states of a model warning that a state is failing: Failure\nExpected = Yes or Failure Expected = No. Then, after a sufficiently large\nnumber of simulation runs, the distribution of probabilities for those two\npossible outcomes will indicate the nature and probability of possible system\noutcomes.\n\u2022 Use cases: Finding well-documented use cases that can be used to test the\nvalidity of the recommendations offered by the model can go a long way\ntoward the model validation in the eyes of the end user. This was the strat-\negy eventually adopted in ACSES. However, this is not sufficient. The model\nshould also be tested with sensitivity analysis (varying the value of one input\nvariable for each system run) or exploratory analysis (varying multiple input\nvariables at the same time) for all variables that matter in the context of the\nuse case at hand. This, of course, is just a use-case-specific variant of the\npossible future validation strategy.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

They are derived from\nthe fundamental properties of the system.\nMany authors have looked into the issue of self-organization from disci-\nplinary perspectives. Krolikowski et al. (2016) provide a good summary of\nsuch efforts. Chih-Chun et al. (2007), on the other hand, discuss the issue\nof emergence in agent-based models. They offer no consensus on either the\ndefinition of self-organization and emergence or formal ways for detecting\nthem in computational systems.\nThe term emergence is especially hard to define. Some researchers make a\ndistinction between weak and strong emergence:\nIf there are phenomena that are strongly emergent [emphasis added] with\nrespect to the domain of physics, then our conception of nature needs\nto be expanded to accommodate them. That is, if there are phenomena\nwhose existence is not deducible from the facts about the exact distribu-\ntion of particles and fields throughout space and [time] (along with the\nlaws of physics), then this suggests that new fundamental laws of nature\nare needed to explain these phenomena.\n(Chambers 2002)\nWe can say that a high-level phenomenon is strongly emergent with\nrespect to a low-level domain when the high-level phenomenon arises\nfrom the low-level domain, but truths concerning that phenomenon are\nnot deducible even in principle from truths in the low-level domain.\nStrong emergence is the notion of emergence that is most common in\nphilosophical discussions of emergence, and is the notion invoked by\nthe British emergentists of the 1920s. \u2026 We can say that a high-level\nphenomenon is weakly emergent with respect to a low-level domain\nwhen the high-level phenomenon arises from the low-level domain,\nbut truths concerning that phenomenon are unexpected given the\nprinciples governing the low-level domain.\n(Chalmers 2006)\nMost practitioners of agent-based modeling deploy the weak definition of\nemergence. Holland (1998) offers \u201cthat the study of emergence is closely tied to\n[the] ability to specify a large, complicated domain via a small set of \u2018laws\u2019.\u201dDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

To\nexplain this, we discuss examples of emergent properties that illustrate\nthe difference between local emergence\u2014where collective behavior\nappears in a small part of the system\u2014and global emergence\u2014where\ncollective behavior pertains to the system as a whole.\nPractice\nIn this chapter, however, we are mostly interested in the pragmatic aspect of\nself-organization and emergence \u2013 detecting them in agent-based model sim-\nulations. In practice, true self-organization and emergence are rarely detected.\nAt least, this is our experience working with students and agent-based mod-\neling practitioners over the years. Their solutions are often prescribed, almost\nas in algorithmic implementations. For example, the student who designed a\nsystem for modeling genocide claimed that the fact that the model always ends\nin genocide (only the time scale changes, but the outcome is always the same)\nconstitutes an example of an emergent property. However, when the student\nchanged some of the elements of agent behavior in the model, the outcome of\nthe system changed significantly, which indicated that it was a characteristic of\nagents that caused the observed outcome rather than the nature of the interac-\ntions among agents. Thus, the cause of the problem was more of an algorithm\nnature (a bug if you will) rather than the nature of an agent-based model (inter-\nactions among agents).\nThis may be due to the fact that only few programmers who learn modeling\nwith procedural languages make a seamless shift to the agent-based modeling\nparadigm. But it is also possible that modelers do not evaluate their models\nappropriately. For example, sensitivity/exploratory analysis is rarely done in\nagent-based modeling projects, even though it is critical to do it for a complete\nunderstanding of agent-based models. Sensitivity/exploratory analysis implies\na thorough sweep through all possible starting states and randomly induced\nexternal shocks to the system over sufficiently long runs to detect all possible\ntypes of system behavior, including emergent properties that appear with some\ndegree of probabilistic consistency. Of course, this is just a speculation. Other\nexplanations might be even more plausible.\nSelf-organization is usually interpreted as an un-programmed spatial clus-\ntering phenomenon in the runs performed during the sensitivity analysis.

Many experts believe that self-organization is a\nmanifestation of certain kind of emergence and that its detection should be\ncovered within the mechanisms for detecting emergence itself. We believe\nthat this approach is not operationally helpful. Our distinction between\nself-organization (as a property of a collection/subset of agents) and emer-\ngence (as a property of the whole system/model in a holistic sense) is probably\nmore helpful in finding ways to detect each. However, we realize that this is\nnot a generally accepted view of the distinction between self-organization and\nemergence.\nIn the ACSES project we could not look for spatial clusters of agents simply\nbecause our agents were spatially aggregated in the 2 \u00d7 2 mile blocks. There\nwere simply too many of them to do it otherwise. Meaningful simulations were\ndone on samples of 5000, 10 000, and 30 million agents. Visual representation\nof them was not practical. However, we could have attempted to look at the\nself-organization of aggregated agents, the 2 \u00d7 2 blocks. However, due to the\ntight schedule of the project, we did not have the time to define superagents as\nthe aggregate of agents occupying spatial elements of the environment. Perhaps\nthis is something we could do in the future.\nEmergence, on the other hand, is much harder to detect, see, look for, or antic-\nipate. It can happen in any aspect of system performance. It can be in the end\nstate the system finds itself most often in, in the type of agents that survive or\nsucceed, in the distribution of population characteristics, or in the longevity of\nthe system, among many other things.\nIn the case of ACSES, the system was complicated. It had over 500 variables,\nand its purpose was to evaluate the utility of three specific social science theo-\nries. Even though we performed sensitivity analysis, it was done in the context\nof which theory was the most plausible one in explaining the use case at hand.\nUnfortunately, there were not many realistic use cases that the project team had\naccess to. Therefore, our testing was limited in nature. This, in the end, proved\nto be the most uncertain aspect of the project, as it prevented the DARPA pro-\ngram manager to form a conclusive opinion about the potential utility of the\nproject.\nHowever, exactly because of the fact that we could not demonstrate the\nend result in the context of verifiable use cases, we thoroughly understood\nthe importance of completely assessing the true nature of the system we\ndeveloped. Agent-based models are tricky. They are never completely verified\nor validated, and their potential is never fully realized, given that we do not\ngive them enough chances to self-organize or emerge. Consequently, their true\nnature is never fully understood.\nThis leads us to the issue of trust. How do we gain the trust of the end user in\nthe statement that an agent-based model will help them address their issues?Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This is\nnot to say that we ourselves, the modelers, are not convinced that the system\nis good and accurate. Of course, we must ensure that the system is, first and\nforemost, accurate to a sufficient degree in terms of the user specifications and\nrequirements. The issue here is knowing what kind of end user validation will\nbe sufficient for the user to accept the model/system as a new tool in his/her\ntoolbox.\nTrust\nThe use of agent-based models depends on the level of trust that is established\nbetween the model and the end user. Proper verification, validation, sensitivity\nanalysis, uncovering self-organization and emergence, and understanding\nperformance of the system under exogenous shocks are critical for secur-\ning the trust of the end user. If that does not happen, then the tool will\nnot be used.\nHowever, it is not enough to earn the trust of the end user. Several other\nissues are often of critical importance to end user\u2019s adoption of an agent-based\nmodel. What works will depend on the project. In some projects, researchers\nare expected to figure things out, build a model, test a model, and only then\nexplain everything to the sponsor. Ideally, however, a process with more inter-\nactions is strongly desirable and will increase the likelihood of good communi-\ncation and the sponsor\u2019s trust and use of the model. The admonitions that follow\nhave analogues in suggestions by William Rouse in his chapter of this volume,\nbased significantly on experience with large health systems (Rouse 2019).\nThey include the following:\n\u2022 Design the model with a clear purpose based on a series of conversations\nbetween designers and end users. Of course, the end user has the final say\non what the purpose of the system is. However, the model designer must\neducate the end user on the characteristics of agent-based models, including\nboth what they can do and what they cannot do well. The designer may also\nwant to build in more functionality than the end user originally anticipates\nwanting.\n\u2022 Ask the user how he/she will evaluate the system, as well as what needs to\nhappen for the system to be adopted. Consult with all relevant stakeholders,\nand provide a way to provide feedback on all phases of the project develop-\nment.\n\u2022 Assure that end users and all stakeholders participate in evaluation of the\nintermediate phases and results of the project development. These interme-\ndiate phase reviews are critical for uncovering issues early on that, if left\nunattended, will lead to the failure of the project in the end.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Have the user interact with mock-ups or proto-\ntypes so as better to identify what works and does not work for him or her.\n\u2022 Similarly, work with the end user to define the nature of interactions between\nuser and system. Present options to the end user, but accommodate to what\nthe end user wants and believes how interactions should feel like (no matter\nhow low tech they might seem to the designer). As with other aspects of the\nwork, designers may want to build in additional functionality, just in case,\nbut only if it does not interfere with what the user believes is needed.\n\u2022 Design the utilities necessary for the end user to perform what-if-type anal-\nysis in the context of the specified purpose.\n\u2022 Provide evidence of the verification, validation, and sensitivity analysis, as\nwell as any other testing that has been performed at any stage of the product\ndevelopment. Where possible, include the end user in some of that testing.\n\u2022 Document all aspects of the system thoroughly, descriptively, operationally,\nand understandably.\nFollowing the above list will go a long way toward establishing the trust of the\nend user in the model itself. Of course, each model development is different,\nand the designer should always expect that the end user would make additional\nrequirements on the model.\nSummary\nThe world is ready for complexity theory. It desperately needs it. Technical\nconnectivity, globalization, scientific and technological advancements, medical\nadvances, social media, and economic growth have made all human-made\nsystems connected. Such systems require complexity-based models to help\nhumans manage and control them.\nAgent-based modeling is one of the methods that is particularly well suited\nfor helping end users understand, explain, predict, and prescribe states and\nconditions of the modern complex adaptive systems that they are dealing with\nor even in charge of. It is sobering, however, to know that no agent-based model\nor application has entered the mainstream market as of yet. This seems to indi-\ncate that there are serious issues with either the capabilities of agent-based\nmodels or users\u2019 perceptions of them.\nTaking into consideration the issues brought up in this chapter may help. The\ntrust of the end users is the key to their adoption of agent-based models and\napplications. The trust will not happen until we, the modelers, can demonstrate\nthat the models can be verified, validated, tested, and effectively used by the\nend user.\nThe potential for the agent-based modeling is huge. It is up to us, however, to\nrealize that potential. The world is ready and primed for it.

In turn, building inhabitants have a major impact on how build-\nings are designed and operated, affecting the consumption of various resources\nover time.\nAt present, the correlation between a given built environment and its effect\non the people who inhabit it becomes known only after the environment has\nbeen built and occupied. Post-occupancy evaluations (POE), for example, com-\npare the expected building performance with the actual one to improve an exist-\ning situation or gain knowledge that can inform the design of future buildings.\nData collected in existing buildings is often analyzed using mathematical meth-\nods (such as regression, deterministic, and stochastic) to correlate variables of\nhuman behavior and the built environment (e.g. Wang et al. 2005; Mahdavi and\nTahmasebi 2015). The assumption that using mathematical models validated in\na specific context helps to predict human behavior aspects in a different con-\ntext, however, may be flawed due to the unique nature of cultural, social, and\nenvironmental conditions.\nDespite much research into human\u2013environment relationships (Barker\n1968; Alexander 1979; Whyte 1980; Gehl 1987; Preiser et al. 2015), no sat-\nisfactory method has yet been developed that can anticipate building\u2013user\ninteractions at the time buildings are designed, rather than after they are built\nand occupied. Failures in doing so may lead to severe consequences, such as\nunderperforming buildings, diminished productivity, general dissatisfaction,\nand imbalances between expected and actual energy consumptions.

Such simulations address specific aspects of buildings, such as\nenergy, daylight, plug loads, and structural integrity. In contrast, simulating\nthe impact of buildings on the people who will occupy them has progressed\nmore slowly compared with the aforementioned methods. Even though human\nbehavior simulation is a well-studied topic in the field of computer animations\nand video games (Kapadia et al. 2015), such a method is yet to be applied to\npredict and analyze how a building design affects different use patterns occur-\nring in it. Simulations of this kind must include, in addition to information\nabout the building itself, information about the intended users of a building,\nand the activities they will perform. Modeling users and activities, however, is a\nchallenging task due to the dynamic, stochastic, psychological, contextual, and\ncultural components involved in describing what people do, where, and when.\nCurrent approaches to investigating human\u2013environment relationships\nmostly rely on static analyses. These methods expand traditional building\nmodels generated with computer-aided design (CAD) or building information\nmodeling (BIM) tools with information about the building\u2019s intended users and\nthe activities they perform. A configurational approach has been proposed by\nHillier and Hanson to analyze people movement in spaces using a graph-based\nspatial representation that measures spatial relations and connectivity (Hillier\nand Hanson 1984). Eastman and Siabiris (1995), Maher et al. (1997), Ekholm\n(2001), and Wurzer (2010) augmented the information contained in spatial\nmodels by providing static descriptions of people activities in space. Kim\nand Fischer (2014a,b) developed an automated method for mapping specific\nactivities onto appropriate spaces. Dzeng et al. (2015) described a model\nto optimize functional use allocation based on a set of space usage metrics\nincluding people movement and flow. Schultz and Bhatt (2012) and Bhatt\net al. (2012, 2013) incorporated into traditional space models aspects of\nspatial cognition and reasoning into traditional space models to support\ndesigners\u2019 decision-making. \u00c7ekmi\u00b8s et al. (2014) demonstrated a method to\nrepresent patterns of human inhabitation in open-planned spaces. Tashakkori\net al. (2015) developed a space model that integrates indoor and outdoor\ninformation for emergency response facilitation.\nThese approaches, however, fail to provide a dynamic, time-based represen-\ntation of a building in use, which accounts for people decision-making abilities\nin response to the building function and to the surrounding physical and social\nenvironment.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While these approaches help\ndesigners test what-if scenarios to reveal how a particular design solution may\naffect the behavior of its inhabitants (Simon 1969), they currently present sig-\nnificant shortcomings when accounting for agents\u2019 perceptual, cognitive, and\ndecision-making abilities in a dynamic, physical, and social context (Kapadia\net al. 2012a).\nA more advanced representation of human behavior in built environments\nis thus needed to model a variety of behaviors, including emergency evacua-\ntions, pedestrian wayfinding, and more holistic use patterns in process-driven\nfacilities, like hospitals. In such settings, behavior is driven by a combination\nof scheduled procedures (e.g. medical checks) and unscheduled adaptations\nof such procedures due to dynamic social and spatial conditions (e.g. spatial\nbottlenecks that affect the flow of human and nonhuman resources).\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. First, we review current\nmethods for simulating human behavior. We then discuss the latest advance-\nments in modeling key components of MAS, such as spaces, actors and activi-\nties, and review behavior authoring frameworks that can be used to coordinate\nthe behavior of multiple agents in a given context. Lastly, we discuss possi-\nble avenues of future research, towards practical tools that can help architects,\nfacility managers and other decision makers design future built environments.\nSimulating Human Behavior \u2013 A Review\nSeveral human behavior simulation methods have been developed to represent\ndifferent kinds of use scenarios. Various literature reviews (Hamacher and Tjan-\ndra 2001; Helbing et al. 2002; Santos and Aguirre 2004; Gilbert and Troitzsch\n2005; Shiwakoti et al. 2008; Zheng et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 2010; Duives et al.\n2013; Thalmann and Musse 2013; Kapadia et al. 2015; Pelechano et al. 2016)\ncollectively provide a comprehensive overview of existing approaches, mainly\nfocusing on crowd simulations in normal or egress situations. Here, we pro-\nvide a broader categorization that transcends the domain of application of the\nmodel to focus on overall modeling principles. The discussed approaches are\nthe following: system dynamics, process-based, flow-based, particle-based and\nMAS.\nSystem Dynamics\nSystem dynamics models describe the behavior of nonlinear systems using\nstocks, flows, and feedback loops (Forrester 1997).

Flows describe the rate of change in stocks.\nFeedback loops characterize causal relationship among entities of the system\n(positive or negative impact). Differential equations describe the different\nstates of the variables that depend on each other and vary over time.\nSuch models are generally used to help decision-makers understand the\nbehavior of industrial and socioeconomic systems, such as the development\nof land use and population growth (Guhathakurta 2002), and people flow in\nhospitals (Brailsford 2008). Nevertheless, examples can be found where system\ndynamics has been used to model emergency egress behaviors in buildings.\nIn the model proposed by Shen (2005), for instance, the rooms of a building\nare modeled as stocks, while the flow among rooms is regulated by a series of\nparameters affecting people movement, including the occupants\u2019 speed and\nthe density of people in the rooms.\nThe high level of abstraction imposed by system-level modeling, however,\nprevents the encoding of information about a building geometry and the indi-\nvidual entities (e.g. the people) that move through a space.\nProcess-Driven Models\nProcess-based models represent human behavior in buildings as a structured\nsequence of activities that require a set of resources (e.g. people, equipment,\nand spaces) and take a certain (usually stochastic) amount of time. Stochastic\nvalues can be associated with the duration of an activity or with the selection\nprocess between alternative activities.\nIn process-based models, space is represented as a network of nodes and\nedges, where nodes may be rooms and edges indicate the connections between\nthem, with an associated (usually stochastic) traversal time. The flow of people\nbetween nodes is described in terms of queuing behavior, whereby a Markov\nchain process describes the probability of an individual moving from one node\nof the network to another (L\u00f8v\u00e5s 1994): when the traffic demand exceeds a\nnode\u2019s capacity, a queue builds up, causing individuals to wait a certain amount\nof time.\nThese kinds of models have been used to analyze resources\u2019 flow in build-\nings where users\u2019 behavior is driven by a specific set of procedures, such as\nhospitals or airports (Sinreich and Marmor 2005; Marmor et al. 2012). Never-\ntheless, they suffer from several limitations. First, they describe individuals in\na homogeneous fashion, averaging away the differences among building occu-\npants. Second, they model spatial features only in terms of the time required\nto traverse spaces, ignoring the multiplicity of effects that spaces produce on\nhuman activities due to people perception and cognition of spatial, social, and\nenvironmental aspects. Third, they do not account for activities that emerge\ndue to spatial or social contingencies, which might delay scheduled activities\nand create spatial congestion.

The premise\nof this approach is that people, under certain conditions (e.g., while trying to\nevacuate a space or in narrow passages) generate a collective movement pattern\nthat is akin to the behavior of gas molecules, particles, or fluids. The behav-\nior of pedestrian crowds has been described at a macro-scale in such fluid-like\nterms using Maxwell-Boltzmann theory (Henderson, 1971), the Navier\u2013Stokes\nequations (Hughes, 2003), and continuum models (Treuille et al., 2006). Such\nmodels are mostly used to represent homogenous crowd movement at a coarse\nlevel of detail (i.e. without focusing on the movement and behavior of the indi-\nvidual crowd members).\nParticle-Based Models\nIn particle-based models, people are considered as homogenous entities with\nidentical properties, whose movement and interactions are governed by global\nlaws. Helbing and Molnar, (1995), for example, describe crowd behavior as a\npattern of attraction and repulsion (social) forces. While such models account\nfor particles\u2019 responses to the spatial and social context, they mostly ignore\nthe cognitive effects on human behavior in a space (Torrens, 2016). Accord-\ningly, they can simulate only specific aspects of human movement in a space,\nfailing to represent more complex human behaviors that depend on peoples\u2019\nautonomous decision-making, and individual profiles.\nMulti-Agent Systems\nIn MAS autonomous agents inhabit dynamic spatial environments and sense,\nplan, and act autonomously to achieve a specific goal (Wooldridge and Jennings\n1995). Agents\u2019 behavior is usually triggered by local conditions (both spatial and\nsocial) rather than global information. It affects and is affected by the behav-\nior of other agents in a reactive manner: each agent pursues its individual goal\n(e.g. exit the building, in case of a fire egress simulation) while reacting to the\nenvironment it perceives (e.g. fire, smoke), as well as to the actions and behav-\niors of other agents (e.g. crowding, etc.). Complex behaviors thus emerge from\nthe unfolding of low-level behaviors and interactions among multiple agents\n(Bonabeau 2002).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

One of the earliest examples is a system\ndeveloped by Reynolds (1982, 1987), where a finite set of rules (separation,\nalignment, and cohesion) are used to simulate the flocking behavior of birdlike\nobjects called boids. Other examples have been developed to simulate human\nbehavior in small urban settings (Yan and Kalay 2004) and in evacuation\nscenarios (Pan et al. 2007; Tang and Ren 2012; Chu et al. 2014; Zhao et al.\n2014).\nWhile MAS successfully address some of the complexities of simulating\nhuman\u2013environment interactions, several challenges must still be addressed\nto represent human behavior in settings populated by different people that\nperform different tasks in a shared space. Such challenges broadly involve\nmodeling: (i) the space that people inhabit, including its geometrical and\nsemantic properties (e.g. a patient room, a nurse station), which constrains\nits use to specific types of activities; (ii) the actors that inhabit those spaces,\nincluding their roles in the building organization as well as their situated\nperceptual and cognitive abilities; (iii) the activities that people engage in,\nsuch as navigating a space or participating in work-related or social meetings;\nand (iv) structured collaborative behaviors performed by multiple agents over\na succession of spaces that comprise a combination of scheduled activities\nand unscheduled adaptations to dynamic social and spatial conditions. In the\nfollowing sections, we describe recent advancements and future directions\nwithin MAS for addressing each of these challenges.\nModeling Social and Spatial Behavior with MAS\nHuman behavior emerges from temporally and physically situated interactions\namong people and with their surrounding environment. It is inseparable from\nboth its physical and social settings, as well as the activities of other occupants.\nTo address the complexities of representing human behavior in built environ-\nments, we propose a comprehensive framework for simulating human social\nand spatial behavior (Figure 29.1). In the following sections, we detail recent\nadvancements and open challenges to model key components of the proposed\nframework, namely, (i) the space, (ii) the actors that inhabit it, (iii) the activi-\nties they engage in, and (iv) disembodied behavior-authoring mechanisms that\ncoordinate complex collaborative behaviors of multiple agents in a given space.\nModeling Spaces\nSpaces represent the physical setting where actors perform activities.

Such models, in fact, mainly focus on the physical\ncomponents of the built environments (e.g. beams, slabs, walls, windows,\ndoors) rather than on the space contained within them. Even though BIM\ntools allow encoding information about the spaces between them (rooms),\nadditional information is required to support a dynamic description of how\npeople move and interact in space.\nGraph-Based Approaches\nThese approaches describe people movement across a network of spaces. In\nsuch representations spaces are modeled as nodes and their connection as links\n(L\u00f8v\u00e5s 1994).

Other approaches, instead, divide\na space into discrete portions of walkable areas, called navigation meshes, to\nsupport agents\u2019 navigation (Kallmann and Kapadia 2014).\nNavigation Meshes\nStatic navigation meshes use a triangulated representation of free space and\nonly consider static obstacles. Dynamic navigation meshes, instead, coarsely\naccount for dynamic properties of the environment. They store time-varying\nspace properties such as a density field, which affects the cost of choosing a\ntriangle for navigation. Such space subdivision, however, is mostly determined\nby navigation-related principles, rather than by perceptual, cognitive, environ-\nmental, or functional considerations, making this representation limited for\nsupporting other kinds of spatial behaviors.\nGrid-Based Approaches\nEnvironments can be discretized into grid cells. This allows for creating a\nsemantically rich collection of cells to define specific kinds of space (e.g.\na room, a corridor) and storing information in each cell (or group of cells)\nabout its dynamic changes, including social and environmental conditions\n(Date et al. 2017a). While this approach enables storing time-varying spatial\nproperties in automatically generated or custom-defined collection of cells,\nproper fine-tuning of the grid cells is required to yield realistic agent move-\nment. Furthermore, this space representation is challenging when representing\nmore dense crowd situations, since agents can occupy only one cell at each\ntime step.\nSemantics and Affordances\nTo yield realistic social and spatial behavior, space models have been empow-\nered with additional calculation abilities to aid agent\u2019s perception in a virtual\nenvironment. A list of semantic and affordance attributes can be associated\nwith discrete space portions to describe how a space is used at a given time\n(Schaumann et al. 2015, 2016a). For instance, in a hospital context, a room can\nbe associated with patient room semantics and with a specific number of activ-\nity types afforded such as clinic, social, private, and assistance. The activation of\na specific affordance determines how a space is currently used, and it stipulates\nwhich other affordances are supported in the same space, therefore allowing or\ninhibiting other behaviors.\nModeling Actors\nActors represent the inhabitants of the built environment.

They are considered as resources that flow in a system\n(much like spaces or equipment). In particle-based models, agents are often\nrepresented homogeneously \u2013 without variance in their goals, perception,\nand decision-making abilities. Built environments, however, are populated\nby different kinds of people, which may have different characteristics, prefer-\nences, and work-related roles. More complex agent models are thus required\nto describe social and spatial behaviors.\nProfiles\nActor models have been associated with specific profiles that include per-\nsonality traits and social group affiliation. Braun et al. (2005) extended\nhomogeneous agent models commonly used is particle-based models (e.g.\nHelbing and Molnar 1995) by assigning each agent a different personality.\nDurup\ud835\udea4nar et al. (2011), Guy et al. (2011), and Kapadia et al. (2012b) incor-\nporated personality traits in crowd simulations. Chu et al. (2014) associated\nwith each individual a specific social group of belonging (e.g. a family), which\ncan affect an agents\u2019 decision-making in egress situations. Mascarenhas\net al. (2016) integrate culture into virtual agent models. Sopher et al. (2017)\ndescribed a general framework to model agents\u2019 profiles, which comprises a\ndescription of static and dynamic features, including their characteristics, sta-\ntus, knowledge, preferences, and abilities. Date et al. (2017b) created different\nuser profiles by assigning to each agent a different threshold of tolerance to an\nenvironmental parameter (e.g. noise), which affects actors\u2019 navigation.\nPerceptual and Cognitive Abilities\nAgents\u2019 perception, cognition, and communication are key factors to guarantee\nrealistic behavior responses to dynamic social and environmental conditions.\nSo far, particular emphasis has been put on visibility issues. Agents have been\nequipped with visual perception abilities including line-of-sight ray casts and\nfoveal cone intersections to see the world around them (Kapadia and Badler\n2012). Other approaches for vision-based steering have been proposed by\nKapadia et al. (2009) and Ond\u02c7rej et al. (2010). In an effort toward multimodal\nperception, Huang et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2014) developed, respectively,\na sound propagation and localization methods to equip autonomous agents\nwith auditory perception capabilities. A cognitive-based approach has been\nproposed by Shao and Terzopoulos (2005), and Kielar and Borrmann (2018).\nKullu et al. (2017) proposed an agent-to-agent communication model for\nsimulating interactive crowds.\nModeling Activities\nActivities represent the dynamic interactions between the actors and the space,\nwhich may involve moving toward a target as well as work-related or social\nmeetings.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It consists of a coordinated and goal-directed\nmovement through the environment (Montello 2005). Navigation broadly\ninvolves pathfinding, steering, and locomotion tasks (Kapadia and Badler 2012).\nPathfinding is the process of finding a collision-free path from the current\nposition of an agent to its target location placed beyond sensory experience,\nusually taking into account static and dynamic aspects of the environment.\nSteering is the act of following a planned path while avoiding static and\ndynamic obstacles. Locomotion animates an actor to a trajectory path output\nby steering, taking into account the abilities (affordances) of the human actor\n(e.g. body articulations, speed, etc.). Kapadia and Badler (2012) and Kallmann\nand Kapadia (2016) provided an extensive review of existing navigation models\nfor autonomous virtual users. Here, we briefly summarize key approaches.\nPrecomputed Roadmaps\nThis method regards the environment as static. Examples include the work of\nSung et al. (2005), Sud et al. (2007), and Kallmann (2010). Built environments,\nhowever, are dynamic due to the movement of people and objects in space and\nthe dynamic environmental conditions. If, for instance, a crowd is temporarily\nblocking a passage, an agent may be required to devise an alternative route to\nthe destination. Planning approaches are thus required that can quickly return\nsolutions with bounds on suboptimality and iteratively refine the solution while\naccommodating dynamic changes in the environment (Kallmann and Kapadia\n2014).\nReactive Planning Approaches\nSuch approaches adopt a one-step look ahead to avoid collisions with most\nimminent threats. Date et al. (2017b), for example, developed a hierarchical\nnavigation system that combines wayfinding and locomotion into a unique\nframework. Each agent computes at each time step both the global and local\npaths toward a target while accounting for dynamic social and environmental\nconditions. Other examples have been developed by Reynolds (1987) and\nLamarche and Donikian (2004).\nPredictive Planning Approaches\nSuch approaches approximate the trajectories of neighbor agents in choos-\ning collision-free trajectories. Examples can be found in the work of Paris\net al. (2007), Van den Berg et al. (2008), Kapadia et al. (2009), Karamouzas et al.\n(2009), Karamouzas and Overmars (2010), and Singh et al. (2011).\nDecision-Making\nIn MAS, actors are often equipped with the ability to autonomously determine\ntheir navigation target. Such target can either be precomputed or calculatedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Actors, for example, can choose a target based on an expected\n(measurable) utility. Hoogendoorn and Bovy (2004) proposed an activity-based\nmodel to analyze travel behavior based on activity scheduling. In Krontiris\net al. (2016), the behavior of virtual agents is determined by environmental\nattractors \u2013 spatial locations that enable the performance of specific activities.\nDifferent types of agent architectures have also been designed to mimic\nthe rational decision-making process of agents to different degrees of com-\nplexity. Among others, the belief\u2013desire\u2013intentions (BDI) architecture (Rao\nand Georgeff 1995) is often used to determine which activity to perform next\nand where.\nMulti-agent approaches, however, can vary in the degree to which individual\nagents can make autonomous decisions. The assumption that complex behav-\niors can be modeled by increasing individual agents\u2019 complexity, in fact, may\nbe invalid when describing collaborative, goal-oriented activities in complex\nsettings (O\u2019Sullivan and Haklay 2000). Behavior-authoring frameworks have\nthus been developed to coherently represent the use phenomenon of a building\nsuch as a hospital or an airport; vast amounts of knowledge must be stored in\neach agent before collaborative behaviors based on cultural norms as well as\nspatial and social circumstances can emerge. A patient check procedure in a\nhospital, for example, where a doctor and a nurse must meet a patient at a cer-\ntain place and time to start the activity, depends on resolving such complexities\nas the presences of the actors at a planned time/space and what to do if one or\nmore of them are delayed.\nBehavior Authoring\nOverarching controlling mechanisms have been developed to direct multiple\nagents\u2019 behavior in space with the purpose of facilitating an overall coherent\nrepresentation of building use phenomena, accounting for shared activities\namong different building inhabitants.\nCentralized Scheduling Systems\nSuch systems assign an activity to different kinds of agents. Goldstein et al.\n(2010) used data-driven user profiles to determine agents\u2019 activities and\ntheir locations. Shen et al. (2012) used precomputed schedules to drive agent\u2019s\nmovement in space. Tabak et al. (2010) developed a scheduling mechanism that\ncombines into one schedule both work-related and leisure-related activities\nin office buildings. Schaumann et al. (2017a) used a dynamic scheduler that\nadopts operation research (OR) techniques to coordinate the performance of\nindividual and collaborative procedures in hospital buildings.\nTop-down management systems have also been proposed to coordinate the\nbehavior of large groups of computer-controlled nonplayer characters (NPC)\nin response to the dynamic behavior of human-controlled avatars (Bates 1992;Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n684 Modeling Social and Spatial Behavior in Built Environments: Current Methods and Future Directions\nMagerko et al. 2004; Shoulson et al. 2011). Such approaches provide dynamic\nadaptations to the game\u2019s unfolding narrative plot to guarantee its coherence\nand consistency over time.\nEvent-Centric Approaches\nEvents are self-contained computational entities that encapsulate a set of\nprocedures for directing the behavior of actors performing goal-oriented\nactivities in some space (Kapadia et al. 2011; Shoulson et al. 2013; Sime-\none and Kalay 2014; Kapadia et al. 2016; Schaumann et al. 2015, 2016a,\n2017b). Event-centric approaches temporarily direct multiple actors to ensure\ncoordinated behaviors that adapt to the dynamic social and spatial context.\nActors participating in an event suspend their autonomy and are exclusively\ncontrolled by the event to ensure coordination between them. To direct actors\u2019\nbehavior in space, events feature a combination of top-down and bottom-up\ncoordination strategies; on the one hand, they dictate what actors should do,\nthereby affording the coordination of collaborative behavior patterns. On the\nother hand, they adapt their execution to bottom-up situations contingent\nupon the dynamic state of the world, such as the time- and context-dependent\nstatus of the spaces and actors involved in the event\u2019s execution.\nEvent Management Systems\nAn event manager dynamically coordinates the performance of scheduled and\nunscheduled events based on context-dependent priorities. It is responsible\nfor monitoring the state of the world, for determining whether the conditions\nrequired to perform specific events are satisfied, and for triggering must urgent/\nimportant events at a given time while resolving conflicts among events com-\npeting for the same resources (e.g. actors or spaces) (Schaumann et al. 2015,\n2017a).\nThe events triggered can be scheduled or unscheduled. Scheduled events\nare expected to be performed at specific times of the day (e.g. the doctors\u2019\nround pattern). Unscheduled events, instead, could manifest themselves at any\ngiven time (e.g. the spontaneous interaction between a doctor and a nurse in\na hospital context), and they may affect the performance of scheduled events.\nIn a hospital setting, for instance, structured collaborative procedures like a\npatient check or a medicine administration are often disrupted by unscheduled\nsocial interactions whereby visitors may ask information to the medical staff in\na hospital corridor causing delays to schedule procedures and even possible\nmistakes.\nPriority values quantify the desirability of the event\u2019s performance (or out-\ncome) at a specific time while accounting for the dynamic conditions of the\nworld (both the condition of the entities participating in the event and any other\ncondition that may directly or indirectly affect the event). Such priorities canDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Event management systems have been proven useful\nto coordinate the performance of planned and unplanned multiple behaviors in\nhospital environments, which involve multiple actors and occur in a series of\nspaces (Schaumann et al. 2017b).\nDiscussion and Future Directions\nIn this chapter, we discussed key challenges in simulating the spatial and social\nbehavior of virtual humans. Despite recent advancements in the area, there is\nmuch more work to be done towards developing practical tools that can assist\narchitects, urban planners, and other decision-makers in designing settings\nthat better perform from the users\u2019 point of view. We believe that the following\ndirections are of particular importance.\nCreating Heterogeneous Agents\nAt present, agents are mostly modeled as homogeneous entities. Different\nagents (or groups of agents), however, exhibit a different spatial behavior\ndepending on their unique characteristics. We pose the need for hetero-\ngeneous agents, with different goals, needs, abilities (motor, sensor), and\nbehaviors (teenagers, parents with kids, grandparents with toddlers). The\nbehavior of each agent type can affect the behavior of other agents located\nin the same space, therefore affecting the overall building use process. In\nhospitals, for example, a wide variety of users (patients, visitors, doctors,\nnurses, technicians, administrative staff ) populate the same space at the same\ntime. The behavior of each user is tightly coupled with the behavior of other\nusers. For example, a visitor that cannot find the location of a patient is likely\nto interrupt a staff member to ask for information (Schaumann et al, 2016b).\nMoreover, patients with special needs may require assistance from the hospital\nstaff to perform the most basic day-to-day activities. Modeling various agent\ncharacteristics and degrees of sensory-motor abilities can support accessibility\nanalyses as well as more holistic studies on how buildings are used. Such\nanalyses hold potential to lead to meaningful design modifications aimed at\nbetter addressing human needs.\nImproving Agents\u2019 Multi-Modal Perception and Cognition\nMore complex perceptual and cognitive models are required to account for\nmulti-modal spatial and social stimuli (H\u00f6lscher et al., 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011;Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n686 Modeling Social and Spatial Behavior in Built Environments: Current Methods and Future Directions\nBhatt et al. 2011, 2017). As Information Technologies (IT) make their way\ninto the fabric of the built environment, so-called \u2018smart\u2019 buildings and cities\n(which are, essentially, technologically-enhanced built environments) are\nfurther impacting the social-physical-cultural aspects of people\u2019s life. Rather\nthan passive stages, IT-enhanced environments become active participants\nin the life of a setting because they sense and communicate to the human\ninhabitants information that lies beyond their motor-sensory perceptive range,\nthereby affecting their decision-making abilities. Thus, technologically-aided\nstimuli should also be incorporated in human behavior simulations since\nthey widely affect human movement and interactions (Gath-Morad et al,\n2016). Such aspects, combined with advanced behavior authoring tools able\nto coordinate the behavior of multiple agents in both process-driven (e.g.\nhospitals, airports, train stations), as well as actor-driven (museums, parks)\nsettings hold potential to improve existing behavior models and yield more\nrealistic results.\nUsing Human Behavior Simulation as a Decision-Support System in\nArchitectural Design\nArchitects and building managers are in dire need of analytical tools able to\npredict how buildings will be used by future inhabitants prior to their con-\nstruction and occupancy. MAS can be used to simulate what-if scenarios in\narchitectural design options or to test multiple design alternatives against a\nset of key performance indicators specified by the various design stakeholders\n(Schaumann, 2018). Based on the simulation results, design stakeholders are\nable to iteratively evaluate multiple design options (Hong et al, 2016; Hong &\nLee, 2018) or optimize architectural layouts against specific criteria (Haworth\net al. 2017; Nagy et al. 2017; Berseth et al, 2018). To support optimization,\ndata-driven approaches could potentially be integrated with simulation frame-\nworks to speed up the calculation process and support faster iterations in archi-\ntectural designs (Qiao et al, 2017; Liu et al., 2017). Efficient ways to communi-\ncate simulation results must also be investigated. Traditional agents are often\nrepresented as 2D particles that move in space. The high level of abstraction\nadopted in such simulations prevents domain experts as well as other design\nstakeholders from easily interpreting the simulation results. Recent advance-\nments in computer graphics support more advanced agent models in terms\nof graphics and motion. Such advances support a clearer communication of\nhuman behavior that helps designers evaluate multiple design solutions (Hong\net al, 2016). Communication of heterogeneous agent models can also be greatly\nenhanced by adding expressivity and variety to the full-body motion of virtual\ncharacters (Kapadia et al., 2015).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Orr\nBiocomplexity Institute & Initiative, University of Virginia, Charlottesville VA 22904, USA\nIntroduction\nRecently, we put forth an initial sketch of what we call the Resolution Thesis Orr\net al. (2018). The thesis holds that (i) models of cognition will be improved given\nconstraints from the structure and dynamics of the social systems in which\nthey are embedded and (ii) the resolution of social simulations of agents will be\nimproved given constraints from cognitive first principles. 1 This thesis reflects\na variety of motivations, the most obvious being the observation that there is\nlittle overlap between the cognitive sciences and the generative social science\napproach, both of which rely heavily on computer simulation to understand\naspects of human systems, albeit at different levels of scale. The former focuses\nalmost exclusively on the mind as a scientific object of study for which the\nlion\u2019s share of simulation efforts reflect methods that represent a generalizable\nconception of the mind, and the latter emphasizes multiple aspects of social\nsystems, the mind being only one of these aspects. Thus, we seem to have some\nkind of historical trade-off: the details of one level of scale result in the potential\noversimplification at the other level of scale. We posit, by the resolution thesis,\nthat an interdependence between cognitive science and generative social sci-\nence could be leveraged for the purposes of improving our understanding of\nimportant phenomena studied by both.\nThe Resolution Thesis can be understood from multiple perspectives. From\nthe generative social science perspective, the Resolution Thesis means that\nthe representations of agents in social simulations should be informed closely\n1 For the purposes of this chapter, cognitive models are theoretical models of human perception,\nthought, and action that includes, broadly, explanations of emotion, motivation, and affect in\naddition to more traditional domains of cognitive psychology and cognitive science; one could\narguably use the term psychological first principles as equivalent to cognitive first principles.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

This\nruns somewhat counter to the principled adherence to simplification of the\ninternal processing of simulated agents found in this literature, a simplification\nthat served to show that complex social dynamics can be driven by simple\nbehavioral rules of agents.\nMore recently, there have been efforts in the generative social sciences that\nacknowledged that closer ties to the psychological and neurophysiological\nunderpinnings of human behavior may yield benefit in terms of modeling\nsocial phenomena. Epstein\u2019s neurocognitive approach is a notable effort in this\nvein (Epstein (2014)); there are other related approaches (e.g. Sakellariou et al.\n2008; Malleson et al. 2012; Caillou et al. 2017). However, there still remains a\nlarge gap between these recent efforts and the implementation of models from\ncognitive science and psychology, not necessarily in principle, but in practice. It\nis worth noting that there are some threads in cognitive science that approach\nsocial modeling from the perspective of cognitive science. In particular,\nRon Sun\u2019s push for multi-agent systems based on cognitive first principles is\nnotable (Sun 2006); other work in this vein exists (Bhattacharyya and Ohlsson\n(2010), Fu and Pirolli (2007), Gonzalez et al. (2003), Huberman et al. (1998),\nLebiere et al. (2000), Reitter and Lebiere (2012), Romero and Lebiere (2014),\nWest and Lebiere (2001), and West et al. (2005). The relatively new field of\ncomputational social psychology is clearly relevant (Vallacher et al. 2017) as\nwell as the computational organizational theory approach (Prietula et al. 1998).\nFrom the view of cognitive science, the Resolution Thesis means that patterns\nof organization (e.g. information flow on the Internet, clustering of behaviors\nin a community) at the social and organizational level should inform cognitive\nmodels when appropriate.2 In other words, these patterns should be included\nas convergent evidence for a theory or model of cognition. At first considera-\ntion this notion may seem hard to fathom because the implications of cognition\nfor the structure and dynamics of social systems are little understood from\nthe cognitive science perspective.3 Without an explanatory scheme that links\nfacets of the cognitive model to aspects of social organization, how do we inter-\npret the convergent evidence from social systems? The work mentioned above\nwith respect to the cognitive first principles within the generative social science\napproach (Bhattacharyya and Ohlsson (2010), Fu and Pirolli (2007), Gonzalez\net al. (2003), (Huberman et al. (1998), Lebiere et al. (2000), Reitter and Lebiere\n(2012), Romero and Lebiere (2014), Sun (2006), West and Lebiere (2001), West\net al. (2005)) begins to put in place a better understanding of the implications\nof cognition on social systems, but does not generally consider simulation out-\nput as part of the convergent evidence for theory at the cognitive level of scale.\n2 The appropriateness may not be easily determined; for social cognition it may be obvious, but it\nmay not be as clear for other domains, e.g. categorization.\n3 Anderson\u2019s Relevance Thesis (Anderson (2002)), a somewhat rare exception, reasons about\nhow cognition may have implications for social organization.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

From the cognitive\nperspective, simulation of social systems with agents grounded deeply in cog-\nnitive first principles does not imply the Resolution Thesis unless the simulation\nresults are used to judge the quality of the cognitive first principles that ground\nthe agents.\nA third and more general view is that the Resolution Thesis is about human\nsocial systems. An understanding of any of these levels of scale is dependent,\nto some degree, on an understanding of the others. In effect, the notion of con-\nvergent evidence as originating, in part, from other levels of scale applies to all\nlevels of scale. The implication is that we should leverage information across\nscale in an iterative and synergistic way.\nThe Resolution Thesis, despite sounding somewhat reasonable at face value, is\nopposed, to some degree, from both the cognitive science and generative social\nscience perspectives. Simon\u2019s notion of nearly decomposable systems \u2013 that\nthe temporal dynamics of adjacent levels of scale, in most systems, are little\ncorrelated \u2013 suggests that we can understand well the dynamics at each level of\nscale independently of the others (Simon 1962)(see Anderson 1972), for simi-\nlar arguments in physical systems). The KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid)\nused heavily in the generative social sciences is clearly akin to Simon\u2019s notion\nand is bolstered by its early wins in understanding the behavior of social sys-\ntems using simple, noncognitive agents (Axelrod et al. 1995), Epstein (2002),\nSchelling (1969). In cognitive science, Newell, in considering the time scale\nof human behavior, suggested that the social band (> 104 seconds, represent-\ning social systems and organizational behavior) is characterized to be weak\nin strength in the sense that it may not reflect computations in a systematic\npurposeful way relative to lower temporal bands, e.g. cognitive and neural pro-\ncesses Newell (1990).\nThese counter arguments notwithstanding, our working assumption is that\nthe degree to which the Resolution Thesis is useful is an empirical issue. The\nstate of the art in technology and computing and the tight coupling between\nthem and the current milieu should afford exploration of the Resolution Thesis.\nTo this end, we have developed the Reciprocal Constraints Paradigm (hence-\nforth RCP), a methodological approach for exploring the Resolution Thesis. The\nvalue of the RCP does not lie in precise formal prescriptions, but in providing\na scaffold for growing our understanding of social systems and possibly reveal-\ning something new about the interdependencies among levels of scale. We will\naddress this last point in more detail in the \u201cDiscussion.\u201d\nThe Reciprocal Constraints Paradigm\nFigure 30.1 shows the four primary components of the RCP: a cognitive sys-\ntem with potential ties to neurophysiology, a social system, and the constraintsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In the RCP social systems and cognitive systems are\nassumed to be derived from and exhibit an abstract set of\nfirst principles and properties, called S and C, respectively.\nAlso captured here is the potential for integrating\nneurophysiological considerations into the cognitive\nsystem when appropriate; these may prove as essential\nfor some social systems (the gray two-headed arrow\nindicates this potential). The notion of constraint refers to\nthe use of information from S and C to inform one\nanother in a principled way.\nbetween levels of scale. We assume that social systems and cognitive systems\nare derived from and exhibit an abstract set of first principles and properties,\ncalled S and C, respectively (e.g. theoretical entities, experimental paradigms,\npatterns in empirical data in respect to the disciplines that address a particular\nlevel of scale). Defining S and C will depend on the social system or cognitive\nsystem of interest. The notion of constraint simply refers to the use of infor-\nmation from S and C to inform one another in a principled way. An upward\nconstraint refers to information from the cognitive level as informing the social\nlevel of scale; downward constraints reverse this relation.\nA primary example of entities from the cognitive level of scale is the set of\nallowable algorithms A such that a \u2208 C. That is, A defines algorithms that are\ngrounded in and thus recognized by work in cognitive science and psychology.\nPrimary examples at the social level of scale are the social structures, channels\nof information, and dynamic aggregate signals of behavior (e.g. a distribution\nof degree in a social network over time) that characterize a social system, a\nlarge fraction of which are formalized using graph theory/network science. It\nis important to emphasize that within S are notions regarding the behavior of\nagents, not only social structures.\nA central assumption in the RCP is that cognitive systems and definitions of\nagent behaviors in social systems are meant to represent human information\nprocessing capacities that can be described as mathematical functions (Van-\nRooij 2008). 4 Thus, at the cognitive level of scale C, we can define a cognitive\nsystem as \ud835\udf13ct \u2236 Ict \u2192 \ud835\udf13ct(i) where Ict is the set of allowable inputs and \ud835\udf13ct(i) is\n4 This is equivalent to Marr\u2019s computational level (Marr (1982).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Naturally, the first step is to\nidentify social phenomena of interest, a task that is inherently tied to one\u2019s per-\nspective. If the perspective is largely cognitive, then the focus would most likely\nbe on understanding the psychological processes, representations, etc. in rela-\ntion to social systems, but informed in some way by entities at the social level\nof scale S. Another perspective, at the social scale, would dictate a concern with\nthe social structures and dynamics of the social system (multiple humans inter-\nacting) with some degree of constraint from cognitive first principles. These\ntwo perspectives are both what we call single-scale approaches to the RCP.\nOf course, one could take a multi-scale perspective that draws from both and\nlikely depends on a simulation approach that captures aspects of C and S in one\nrunnable system.\nWe will address the obvious issues and difficulties in applying the RCP after\nproviding a description of some potential methods for application. The goal in\nthis section is simply to express what it might look like to apply the RCP.\nSingle-Scale Approaches\nThe single-scale approach of the RCP aims to elucidate or refine a model at one\nlevel of scale by using some information from another level.\nConsider the cognitive scale. The single-scale approach amounts to mapping\nsome properties of social systems to properties of cognitive systems for the pur-\npose of identifying potential implications of social structure and dynamics that\nshould be considered when evaluating a model of cognitive process or represen-\ntation. For example, suppose one has in hand a cognitive model of how humans\nacquire attitudes from social interactions (via some learning process) that has\nnot yet been evaluated against empirical data. From the perspective of the RCP,\nproper evaluation of the model (of attitude acquisition) would incorporate or\nconsider aspects of the social level of scale that may have implications for the\ncognitive system.\nIn this hypothetical example, we might start with the observation that cog-\nnitive learning mechanisms are known to be sensitive to the sequential order\nin which information is presented to the system.6 Also, we might observe that\n5 Social and cognitive systems may define parameters regarding variability among a set of agents;\nthis is not reflected here.\n6 We see these phenomena broadly, for example, in attitude formation (Cacioppo et al. 1992),\ncategorization (Heit 1994), and text comprehension (McNamara and Kintsch 1996).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n702 Multi-Scale Resolution of Human Social Systems\nat the social level of scale, the patterning and dynamics of social interactions\nare dependent upon some properties of S if S contains graph G where V (G)\nand E(G) are the agents and information channels, respectively. Thus, graph G\nmay have implications for the inputs to the attitude acquisition model in terms\nof the distribution and sequential ordering of features that the attitude model\ncares about (e.g. beliefs).\nWhat do these observations in aggregate (one at each level of scale) tell us\nabout how to evaluate the cognitive model of attitudes? The notion, from the\nperspective of the RCP, is that some consideration for how networks affect the\ndistribution of and sequential ordering of the inputs should be incorporated\ninto the design of the empirical observations. Generating random distribu-\ntions of inputs might not suffice because the hypothesized cognitive model may\nbe representing something in humans that is sensitive to networked informa-\ntion flow. In short, understanding the flow of information on networks might\nincrease the realism of the experimental context used to evaluate the cognitive\nmodel.\nThis is one example of trying to understand the implications of social proper-\nties on cognitive systems; what this means precisely would depend on the social\nphenomena of interest (e.g. early language development may depend on a dif-\nferent G \u2208 S compared with racial stereotypes or large-scale population biases\nin attitudes).\nAt the social level of scale, there is a similar approach \u2013 mapping the proper-\nties of cognitive systems to social systems to reveal potential implications from\nthe former to the latter. An obvious approach is an analysis of the degree to\nwhich the definitions of agent behavior \ud835\udf19at compares to any cognitive system\n\ud835\udf13ct \u2208 C for the purpose of clarifying to what degree a social agent seems to be\naligned with cognitive first principles. For the case in which the agent behavior\ndefinitions and the cognitive system \ud835\udf19at and \ud835\udf13ct are formally well defined, this\nmight be relatively straightforward,7 but this is in no way guaranteed.\nCertainly, there will be cases for which \ud835\udf13ct is not formally defined.8 In fact, a\nlikely scenario is that the closest matching cognitive system \ud835\udf13ct for the phenom-\nena at hand is only defined in terms of an experimental paradigm, somewhat\nill-defined, nonformal theoretical entities and an interpretation of empirical\ndata resulting from application of the experimental paradigm that respects the\ntheoretical entities. So, in this scenario, how does one go about comparing an\nexisting definition of agent behaviors \ud835\udf19at defined in a social system to the prop-\nerties of a cognitive system \ud835\udf13ct when the nature of the two representations is\nvastly different? This is not a trivial task, but one approach would be to exploit\n7 Potential methods for such a comparison would, ideally, focus not only on the comparison of\ninput/output functions but also on the nature of the runnable algorithms.\n8 Many theoretical entities in psychology are not formalized in precise mathematical or\ncomputational terms but in terms of experimental methods and the relative interpretation of\nresults using statistical methods and reasoning.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In other words, one could mimic the existing experimental paradigm\nthat is the basis for the cognitive system through simulation with agents stand-\ning in for humans (assuming \ud835\udf19at is defined algorithmically). In essence, this is\nlike running a psychological experiment on artificial agents.9 The output of the\nsimulations could be compared to the patterning and dynamics of human per-\nformance in the original empirical data on humans. This is one suggestion of\nmany potentials, but we hope it illustrates well the potential difficulties.\nIn summary, although the single-scale approach does not represent the\nfull-blown resolution thesis, it might afford better resolution of a target level\nof scale by considering some of the implications of other levels of scale. The\nspecific phenomena of interest will drive the precise approaches used.\nMulti-scale Approaches\nThe multi-scale approach is simple in principle: build a simulation platform that\nsimultaneously captures essential aspects of both the social and cognitive sys-\ntems S and C in respect to a social phenomenon of interest (e.g. an agent-based\nmodel of cognitive agents). The upward constraints would mean defining agent\ndefinitions \ud835\udf19at from cognitive first principles. The downward constraints, gen-\nerated by some measure of how well the simulation of the social system matches\nthe empirical regularities as defined by the phenomena of interest, would serve\nas a signal that would suggest modifications to S, C or both. If this scheme seems\nsimplistic, the details of its application are not.\nWe will illustrate using a hypothetical example. Imagine we are interested\nin the patterning of obesity by race/ethnicity, a phenomenon of interest with\nkey social and policy aspects (e.g. cultural attractor states, social and shared\nenvironmental influence, spatial patterning co-occurring with racial segrega-\ntion and residential mobility) and, in fact, a preexisting set of social simulations\nfrom which to draw (see Nianogo and Arah 2015). Assume we adopt one of the\nexisting simulation approaches, none of which incorporate much in terms of\ncognitive first principles in C. Given this starting point, one approach would\nbe to substitute a suitable cognitive system \ud835\udf13ct for the agent behavior defini-\ntions \ud835\udf19at while keeping the other aspects identical to the original simulation. In\nother words, we would infuse cognition into the agents.\nTo do this, because the context is within a simulation environment, there\nis a minimum requirement that the inputs to and outputs from the cognitive\nsystem \ud835\udf13ct match what the simulation environment has available (for input)\nand expects as output relative to agents. However, a deeper concern is to\n9 This approach, comparing human experimental data against an isomorphic simulated\nexperiment where a cognitive model is a stand-in for a human, is common in computational\npsychology and cognitive science.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Choosing among such alternatives may be difficult\nor may limit the degree to which aspects of the agent behavior defined by \ud835\udf19at\nthat can be captured by substitution.\nWe are now, already, at an interesting point in this hypothetical scenario\nbecause it yields potentially difficult decision points. For example, if \ud835\udf19at does\nnot match any existing \ud835\udf13cti , what is implied? We might assume that the\nagent behavior definitions \ud835\udf19at might not align with what we know about obe-\nsity behavior at the cognitive level of scale. Or it could be argued that the health\nbehavior field, in respect to the processes for which the agent model was devel-\noped to study, has yet to develop a cognitive system \ud835\udf13cti that matches \ud835\udf19at . One\ncould easily complicate this decision point further or add layers of complica-\ntion, but we wanted to point out that it gets complicated, fast, with nontrivial\nsolutions, e.g. the development of a cognitive model of a specific health\nbehavior that is grounded empirically takes substantial effort and resources.\nHowever, let us assume that we find a suitable existing cognitive system \ud835\udf13ct\nto substitute for the agent behavior definitions \ud835\udf19at . Our next task would be\nto consider the downward constraints. Imagine that along with a preexisting\nsocial simulation from which to co-opt, come empirical data, judged of ade-\nquate quality, that could be used to compute an objective function with respect\nto the simulations accuracy given our substitution of \ud835\udf13ct for \ud835\udf19at . This signal,\nthen, would serve as the downward constraint, i.e. a signal that may indicate\nissues with the cognitive model.10\nLet us assume that the simulation does poorly in terms of accuracy; what is\nto be done? One might conduct a set of Monte Carlo simulations to measure\nthe departure from accuracy with respect to the parameters of the cognitive\nsystem \ud835\udf13ct and consider optimizing these parameters to maximize accuracy.\nBut this raises a subtle concern \u2013 some would argue that not all parameters in\n\ud835\udf13ct should be free to vary on theoretical grounds (Reitter and Lebiere 2010). So,\nwe could take this concern into account for our optimization approach.\nIt would be reasonable at this point, especially given the potential insights\nthat the Monte Carlo simulations might provide, to revisit the cognitive model\nand consider it from multiple angles. What is the empirical basis of the model?\nIs it replicated? What was its purpose originally? Has the model been used\nacross several applied settings? Are the assumed cognitive processes and rep-\nresentations grounded in other similar models of similar phenomena? Given\n10 One might reasonable use the difference between accuracy given \ud835\udf13 and \ud835\udf19 instead.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Would this spur further experimentation at the cognitive\nlevel of scale? What would this look like? Would a new experimental paradigm\nbe generated that respected the structure in the agent-based model? These are\nall possibilities.\nAnother concern, aside from issues with the cognitive model, is that unless\nthe properties in S captured in the simulation completely reproduce the empir-\nical data (within a reasonable degree of tolerance), one needs to consider, given\nthe objective function, whether to vary some components in the simulation that\nrepresent something in the social system S instead of or in addition to features\nof the cognitive system C.\nThe above scenario is but one approach, one that is largely fixing the social\nsystem S and importing a cognitive system C. But what if we fix C and generate\nS instead? What does this look like? We will stay with the obesity example from\nabove, but change the scenario such that we do not know about any simula-\ntion approaches that represent mainly S. Instead, imagine that what we know\nabout the social system S is a set of population-level empirical studies, some of\nwhich include information on social networks and the built environment and\nsome theoretical statements about peer influence on social networks. Further-\nmore, similar to the scenario above, there is a limited set of candidate cognitive\nsystems to consider ({\ud835\udf13cti , \ud835\udf13ctj , \ud835\udf13ctk , \u2026 , \ud835\udf13ctn }) in the health behavior tradition,\nand, likely, other relevant aspects of the cognitive system C may not be repre-\nsented in them (e.g. categorization, learning, and memory processes). Further,\nonly one of these candidate \ud835\udf13cti is in a computational formalism.11 We decide\nthat \ud835\udf13cti will serve as our starting point and call it simply \ud835\udf13ct .\nAnalysis of \ud835\udf13ct reveals that it captures the learning and on-the-fly formation\nof attitudes toward specific health behaviors (considered a precursor to behav-\nior), it is composed in a general manner such that it applies to virtually any\nhealth behavior, and it is empirically grounded using traditional health behavior\ntheory measurement techniques (in one particular behavioral domain).\nThese features are useful, but some key components are missing that are akin\nto first principles of social system S. In particular, \ud835\udf13ct is mute with respect to\nthe generation of social structure and related dynamics (e.g. decision-making\nfor initiating/dissolving relationships; social influence mechanisms in terms of\nhow others\u2019 behavior or attitudes can potentially serve as the input to the cog-\nnitive system \ud835\udf13ct ). Thus, at minimum, some decision points arise in terms of\nhow the simulation implements generation and change in network structure\nand the mechanism of social influence.\nTo this end, one could start by implementing a static network topology that\ncaptures regularities found in empirical studies of human social networks and\n11 There do exist a small handful of computationally implemented health behavior theories; see\nOrr and Chen (2017) for a review.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In terms of\nsocial influence, we might assume that what is spreading are attitudes and that\nexposure to others\u2019 attitudes can serve as input to an agent12 and further there\nis a knowable stochastic function between attitude and behaviors relating to\nobesity, e.g. energy balance behaviors relating to caloric intake and use. At this\npoint, we could build out further the social structure and dynamics in rela-\ntion to the problem of interest using both theoretic and empirical components\nfrom S, e.g. racial/ethnic distributions in obesity.\nNotice that what is going on here is a process of building from a cognitive\nkernel and adding layers of assumptions from S where S includes different kinds\nof information.13 At some point, we need to run the simulation and determine\nhow to apply the downward constraint.\nOnce the simulation is runnable, the downward constraint could operate, as\ndescribed above, by computing an objective function with respect to the accu-\nracy of the simulation compared with extant empirical data at the social level\nof scale. Here, the issues are mainly the same as in the fixing S and importing C\ncase described above. We will not explore this further, as it is described above.\nThese two examples are largely hypothetical versions of the multi-scale\napproach to the RCP. The value, we hope, is to provide some sketches of what\nit might look like in practice. Clearly, there are many issues that are raised,\neven by these sketches, let alone by the general notion of the RCP and the\nResolution Thesis.\nDiscussion\nWe have presented the Resolution Thesis, its motivation, an approach for acting\non its premises, and some examples of what application of the Reciprocal\nConstraints Paradigm might look like. The latter was, largely, an exercise\nin emphasis \u2013 application of the RCP is fraught with difficulties on several\ndimensions, e.g. theories about the individual-level behavior may have little\noverlap with theories developed in a sociological or demographic context;\ncompute resources may outstrip what is available when integrating cognitive\nmodeling with social modeling; adjudicating over many free parameters across\nlevels of scale given one error signal will not be clear-cut; defining and devel-\noping algorithms of behavior from largely ill-defined, nonformal descriptions\nof individual-level behavior may require conducting clever human subject\nexperiments; there may be issues with the quality and sparsity of data with\nrespect to both observations and theoretical entities. In short, the emphasis\n12 We have implemented prototypes of this sort Orr et al.

For the remainder of the\nchapter, we will shift our focus on developing a deeper understanding of the\npurpose and goal of the RCP.\nOne way to understand the RCP is as a repair for a series of historical\naccidents \u2013 the ones that generated strong divisions between disciplines at or\nclose to the scale of the individual, e.g. neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry\nand cognitive science on one hand and disciplines at larger scales, e.g. sociology,\ndemography, communications, and economics on the other. The issue, for our\nthesis and the RCP, is that this division is reflected in the various approaches\nfor simulation of human behavior among which the methods for interfacing\nbetween them are not well understood. The repair, so to speak, is designed to\nincrease the degree of confidence we have in developing an understanding of\nsocial systems from a truly multi-scale perspective, one that provides scientific\nadvancement within and between levels of scale, simultaneously.\nBut there is more subtlety here, maybe best illustrated by a thought experi-\nment. Imagine an alien is sent to Earth to observe and understand the social\nbehavior of humans. It might observe things like stock markets, automobile\ntraffic dynamics, pedestrian patterns in cities, mating behavior, warfare, the\nInternet, etc. It could also consider some closer observation of single individ-\nuals in controlled contexts or in contexts that are well measured. It might also\ncome to recognize that other living species seem to have similar social orga-\nnizational principles, at least at some level of abstraction. In short, the alien\u2019s\napproach would be to understand various levels of scale but driven by a uni-\nfied, holistic perspective; one might call this approach scale-agnostic, to mean\nthat it learns about the parts and interactions as one. Scale is a convenience for\nunderstanding parts of the system in the service of understanding the whole.\nSome readers might notice parallels between the alien\u2019s approach and\nevolutionary biology and sociobiology (see the classic, Wilson 2000) \u2013 so in a\nstrong sense, there is nothing new in the alien\u2019s approach. We have designed\nthis thought experiment to emphasize the goal of the alien\u2019s approach, a\ngoal that matches that of the RCP: a holistic, scale-agnostic way of under-\nstanding the varieties of behaviors in a system, such as its components, their\ninterdependencies, and its more macro properties.\nThe issue we face today is that integrating neurophysiology, cognitive science,\ngame theory, and sociology into an agent-based framework heavily imbued\nwith network science, physics, and computer science perspectives is a patch-\nwork.14 The goal of the RCP is to transform this patchwork into a unified whole.\nThe key component, or tool if you will, that is offered by the RCP is the system-\natic application of constraints between levels of scale. Over time, through many\niterations, the parts and the whole should, we hope, become more aligned in a\nway that mirrors the product and goal of the alien\u2019s approach described above.\n14 Clearly, there are other disciplines we could add to this list, but these are some of the core.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The study developed an illustrative scenario that could be explored\nwith simulation (Levis and Carley 2011). Although many aspects of the sce-\nnario were fictitious (decisions, results), the scenario was based on events that\noccurred in 2002 and used the actual names of countries, regions, and officials\nat the time. The scenario was as follows:\n\u2022 The animosity between India and Pakistan has its roots in history and reli-\ngion and is epitomized by the long-running conflict over the state of Jammu\nand Kashmir. China administers an area called Aksai Chin at the northeast-\nern corner of Jammu and Kashmir, although India contests Chinese control.\n\u2022 A sequence of terrorist incidents has occurred in Srinagar, the capital of the\nIndian-administered state of J&K, and along the line of control (LOC) sepa-\nrating the Northern Areas controlled by Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir\ncontrolled by India. There is growing instability and disaffection with the\ngovernment in Pakistan, while in India the opposition parties are becom-\ning stronger. The two countries start making a series of escalating moves\n(e.g. they recall diplomatic staff, move troops toward the LOC, reposition\nmobile missile batteries, and initiate activities in their nuclear weapon facili-\nties). Events such as bombings are taking place on both sides of the LOC. As\nusual in such situations, escalations occur in part because each side lacks an\nunderstanding of the adversary\u2019s intent. It may know facts about, e.g. troop\nmovements, but not about adversary intent and strategy.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

The\nUnited Nations and Russia contemplate possible involvement. The common\nobjective of the United States and the larger international community is\nto dissuade or deter the two adversaries from escalating the situation into\na nuclear exchange. They want to facilitate a rapid de-escalation of crisis.\nBecause misinformation and misinterpretations (sometimes reflecting\ndomestic pressures) can foster escalation, the US commands are consider-\ning an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) plan to keep its\nleaders informed and a complementary information operations campaign\nin which the United States provides improved information about the state\nof the conflict to the two adversaries, thus reducing the ambiguities and\npotential for unintended escalation.\nGiven this illustrative scenario, the objective in the study was to analyze\nthe situation and to develop and analyze alternative courses of action (COAs)\nintended to help in de-escalating the crisis. In doing so, the study considered\nall instruments of national power: diplomatic, information, military, economic\n(DIME). To do it, a diverse set of social-behavioral models was used.\nTwo short-duration vignettes were considered for the scenario period from\n1 June 2002 to 20 July 2002. The first addressed CENTCOM\u2019s and PACOM\u2019s\nobservations of the situation and the diplomatic and military maneuvers by\nIndia and Pakistan. Each command had a collection of contingency plans\n(CONPLANs) for their geographic AOR. This situation would cause both com-\nmands to more closely observe as well as update their respective CONPLANs\nand supporting models. Each command would also develop multiple COAs\nthat are focused on broadly defined diplomatic actions and on surveillance\nand other intelligence activities. The second vignette (B) assumed that the\nCOAs of vignette A had not produced the desired results and that the crisis\nwas escalating. CENTCOM and PACOM assessed the situation and developed\nCOA to de-escalate the crisis (Levis and Carley 2011).\nClearly, no single model could capture the many aspects of the problem.\nSocial Network models drew on documents of the period to represent the\nkey decision-makers in the Pakistani and Indian governments. Colored Petri\nnets represented organizational structures and processes at CENTCOM and\nPACOM. Comparisons between the formal organizations, as defined in Petri\nnet models, and the empirical data captured in the Social Networks led to the\nrefinement of both models. An agent-based model then enabled consideration\nof dynamic interactions. A Timed Influence Net was used for the situational\nassessment model and to generate potential COA.

CAESAR III is based on the Petri net formalism, and PYTHIA is\nTimed Influence Nets, a specialization of Bayesian nets; both were developed\nat the System Architectures Lab at George Mason University. ORA, a Social\nNetwork analysis tool, and Construct, an agent-based modeling tool, were\ndeveloped at CASOS at Carnegie Mellon University. The figure also indicates\nthe diversity of data sources that were used to build the models.\nThe approach that was used to address this problem required multi-formalism\nmodeling. But since the models interacted with each other, the question arose:\nAlthough technology enables us to connect and interoperate such diverse\nmodels, expressed in different mathematical and modeling formalisms, how\ncan we be assured that their interoperation is valid?\nIntroduction\nThe richness and variety of modeling formalisms, each of which is tailored\non a specific class of problems, not only empowers the modeling process\nbut also results in the proliferation of different models when coping with\ncomplex social-behavioral systems. These individual model types may draw\nfrom the same or different data sets and can address one or several aspects\nof the problem. In practice, they might not be aligned to each other and\nthe mutual influences connecting them could be lost, weakening the overall\nresults. Multi-formalism modeling is an approach to modeling that aims to\ncoherently combine different modeling formalisms for different aspects of the\nsame entity while appropriately reflecting mutual influences among models.\nMulti-modeling, another term often used, includes the interoperation of\ndifferent models expressed in the same formalism.\n\u201cModeling is the process of producing a model; a model is a representation\nof the construction and working of some system of interest\u201d (Maria 1997).\nFigure 31.2 represents the modeling hierarchy where a model is obtained using\na modeling tool that applies a modeling formalism to represent a specific\nsystem. The model itself should always conform to the modeling formalism\nused to create it. In this context, the term formalism refers to a formal or\nformalized syntactical definition for a modeling language (in textual, graphical,\nor other form) used to describe an abstraction of a system. A formalism\nemploys proper distinguishable syntactical elements to represent atomic or\nnonatomic components of the system with their properties and syntactical\nconstructs that describe the rules by which elements can be used to form a\ngood representation. It is thus a description tool to capture and abstract some\nspecific aspects of a social-behavioral system and provide a coherent and\nformal representation of it. Some formalisms are executable (i.e. they generateDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

They are\nanalogous to the seven layers of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) architec-\nture (MacKinnon et al. 1990). The physical layer (hardware and software) is a\nplatform that enables the concurrent execution of multiple models expressed\nin different formalisms and provides the ability to exchange data and also to\nschedule the events across the different models. The syntactic layer assures\nthat the right data are exchanged among the models. Once this is achieved,\na third problem needs to be addressed at the semantic layer, where the interop-\neration of different models is examined to ensure that conflicting assumptions\nin different modeling formalisms are recognized and form constraints to the\nexchange of data. The use of layers provides a conceptual framework for dis-\ncussing what needs to be done in order to use multiple interoperating models.\nTestbeds usually provide the physical and syntactic layers in an integrated way.\nThe implementation of the workflow layer is closely coupled to the syntactic\nlayer. In the workflow layer, valid combinations of interoperating models are\nconsidered to address specific issues. Different issues require different work-\nflows. Each of these layers and the research challenges they pose are discussed\nin subsequent sections in this chapter.\nBecause the social-behavioral domain is very complex when observed from\ndifferent perspectives, a classification scheme is needed that can place different\nmodeling approaches and modeling formalisms in context but in a way that is\nmeaningful to empiricists who collect the data, to modelers that need data to\ndevelop and test their models, and to theoreticians who use model-generated\ndata to induce theoretical insights.

Data may be punctual\nor expressed by time series, related to an entity or a population, focusing on\nindividuals or their relations: this requires a classification and taxonomy of\nmodel types and how data relate to them to bridge the gap between data and\nmodels. As a start to the development of a taxonomy for the problem space,\nthree dimensions are considered: social entity or granularity, time, and scope of\nproblem.\nSocial Entity or Granularity\nThis is an important dimension because it addresses the issue of improper gen-\neralization of the data. Being explicit in specifying the characterization of the\nsocial entity that will be modeled and analyzed is essential. The social entity\nclassification can range from a specific individual (e.g. a military leader) to a cell\nor team (e.g. a terrorist cell), to a clan or tribe, to an ethnic or religious group,\nand all the way to a multicultural population \u2013 the society \u2013 of a nation-state.\nThere are serious definitional issues with regard to the social entity that need\nto be addressed by mathematical and computational modelers such as spatial,\ntemporal, and boundary constraints, sphere of influence, change processes, and\nadaptation rate. For example, while the boundaries of an individual are imper-\nmeable, the boundaries of a tribe are permeable. Marriage may entail crossing\nclan or tribal boundaries and, interestingly, in both directions. Individuals can\nbe in only one location at a time, whereas groups can have a very complex\nspatial\u2013temporal presence. As the size of the social entity increases, the sphere\nof influence size may increase, the physical space covered may increase, and\nthe adaptation rate decreases. Depending on the situation, the time response\nof individuals, or enterprises, or even nation-states can range from seconds\nto years; similarly, adaptation to new situations may require minutes, weeks,\nmonths, or years to take effect. Finally, the change processes are different with\nindividuals changing as they learn and nation-states changing through pro-\ncesses such as migration, legislation, economic collapse, and war.\nTime\nThe time attribute is complex and cannot be captured by a single variable. First,\ntime spans over periods, requiring variables for at least the starting and ending\npoints. Another possible attribute is the interval between sampling instants.\nSecond, there is the time dimension of the model itself (the epoch that model\nrepresents that can be an instant or a period). Choosing an instant leads to static\nmodels; the instant of time can be a point in the timeline, a month, a year, or\nany other epoch. Essentially, a static description of the social-behavioral sys-\ntem is developed that remains unchanged during that epoch. The alternative\nis considering a dynamic model in which behavior changes.

The\nlength of time that the model addresses (its time horizon) is a key temporal\nvariable.\nThe time dimension is closely related to the scope of the problem and is also\nrelated to the size of the social entity being considered \u2013 as the time horizon\nincreases, the sphere of influence (i.e. the size of the social entity that will be\nimpacted) is increased. Furthermore, the larger the social entity, the longer the\ntime horizon that may need to be considered to observe effects on the behavior.\nWhile exceptions are possible, this consideration restricts meaningful combi-\nnations of entity size and time horizon.\nIn many cases, the mathematical and computational models are created so\nthat they can be used in developing strategies to effect change that will increase\nthe effectiveness of the system. In this case, proper time handling is essential\nboth in the model and the underlying data. An additional challenge with respect\nto the temporal dimension(s) is considering the persistence of effects on the\ntargeted social entity; it is important to account not only for delays in an effect\nbecoming observable but also for its possible gradual attenuation over time.\nScope of Problem\nMilitary decisions are usually characterized as tactical, operational, and strate-\ngic. Often, tactical decisions are concerned with the present and immediate\nfuture and with a limited spatial scale, operational decisions with the near-term\nfuture and possibly larger spatial scale, and strategic decisions with the long\nterm and again possibly at the geopolitical level. However, information tech-\nnology has changed this: tactical decisions may have almost immediate strate-\ngic implications. The three types have become tightly coupled. For example,\na terrorist act, itself a small tactical operation, can have significant strategic\nimpact by changing the long-term behavior of a population (e.g. an unsuc-\ncessful terrorist action on an airplane causing significant changes in air travel\nsecurity worldwide). Similarly, long-term oppression of a population coupled\nwith demographic changes can cause a sudden eruption of violent protest.\nThese three dimensions (social entity, time, and scope) define some key\naspects of the problem space for modeling diverse types of social-behavioral\nsystems (Figure 31.3). Additional dimensions can be used as needed. For\nexample, a fourth dimension can indicate the types of data sources available,\nwhile a fifth one may include the modeling formalisms that are appropriate for\nthe issue being investigated.\nGiven a classification scheme and the appropriate ordering, we can define\na set of feasible cells in the three-dimensional space of Figure 31.3. Each cell\ndefines a particular model by specifying (i) the social entity being considered,\n(ii) the scope of the issue to be addressed, and (iii) the epoch over which the\nproposed model will apply. Some cells may not correspond to interesting cases.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The next step is to identify the\nformalisms appropriate to the system of interest. The classification scheme of\nFigure 31.3 acts as the first filter for identifying appropriate formalisms based\non social entity, scope, and time dimension and identifying those that are inap-\npropriate because of granularity or temporal considerations. Having identified\na set of modeling formalisms, the existence of multiple modeling alternatives\nleads to two questions: What data are required for each modeling formalism,\nand how will the various models interoperate?\nAlso, some mathematical and computational models, by their basic assump-\ntions, may not be able to be associated with specific values of the other axes.\nFor example, applying agent-based models to a single individual is odd, so the\ncorresponding set of cells would be empty. Multiple models may share a cell,\ndepending on the problem scope. The classification scheme selected for each\naxis should make sense with respect to the problem domain. For example, ter-\nrorist organizations exist and operate amidst civilian (noncombatant) popula-\ntions. Since no single model can capture well both the terrorist cell dynamics\nand the noncombatant population behavior, a set of interoperating models are\nneeded.\nThe multi-formalism modeling approach aims to define techniques and\nmethods that allow coordinating the modeling of different aspects of a system\nby means of interoperating heterogeneous models. This interoperation can\nbe implemented in a variety of ways: from composing a single macro-model\nby a set of proper sub-models, for each of which the most suited modeling\nformalism should be applied without losing the coherence of the overall model\n(Sanders et al. 2007), to a dynamic network of models that are invoked to\ndo their part in accordance with a workflow designed to address an issue.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Multi-formalism modeling\ncan support the design of complex systems by allowing field experts to use\nfamiliar tools through composing them and coordinating their interoperation.\nLet modular multi-formalism define the case in which it is possible to obtain\na model as composition of heterogeneous sub-models or to decompose a model\ninto heterogeneous sub-models (Gribaudo and Iacono 2014). Model composi-\ntion of this type potentially offers some advantages in managing the complex-\nity of a model and in facilitating sharing and reuse. Let a composed model be\na model obtained by composition of sub-models (Davis and Anderson 2003,\n2004). Let composition semantics define a mechanism by which, during a com-\nposed model solution process, sub-models can interact. A given composition\nsemantic can be applied in any step of every solution strategy presented. The\ncomposition semantics are implemented in the form of a workflow that man-\nages the execution of the composed model.\nNote that interactions among the components of the composed model can\ntake a wide variety of forms: two models run in series with the output of one\nproviding an input to the other; one model can be invoked and run inside\nanother; two models run side by side and interoperate; and one model is\nused to construct another by providing design parameters and constraints or\nto construct the whole or part of another model. The interoperation can be\ncomplementary or supplementary; these are aspects of the need for semantic\ninteroperability.\nIssues in Multi-formalism Modeling and Use\nThe Physical Layer and the Syntactic Layer\nThis physical layer is a computational platform that enables the concurrent exe-\ncution of multiple models expressed in different modeling formalisms and pro-\nvides the ability to exchange data and also, if necessary, to schedule the events\nacross the different interoperating models that have different time scales. The\nsecond layer is the syntactic layer that assures that the right data are exchanged\namong the models. Some of the technical and implementation issues regarding\nthe physical layer were resolved more than a decade ago. There are numerous\ntestbeds, based on different principles, which enable the interoperation of mod-\nels. Three different examples follow.\nIn SHARPE (Symbolic Hierarchical Automated Reliability and Performance\nEvaluator) (Trivedi 2002) models are composed of sub-models in a fixed set of\ndifferent formalisms with different execution algorithms. SHARPE deals withDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Modularity is managed at model\nlevel by its source code.\nSIMTHESys (Structured Infrastructure for Multi-formalism modeling and\nTesting of Heterogeneous formalisms and Extensions for SYStems) (Barbierato\net al. 2011a,b; Iacono et al. 2012) provides a methodology for extensible\ndesign and evaluation of multi-formalism models, with model composition\nand multiple solution methods. It is based on the explicit definition of\nboth syntax and semantics of all atomic components of a formalism and\non a set of nonspecialized computational engines that are used to generate\n(multi)formalism-specific reusable solvers. (A solver applies a numerical\nmethod to solve the set of equations \u2013 or formalisms \u2013 that represent the\nmodel.) Model interactions are defined by arc superposition.\nThe C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) is an integrated multi-modeling simulation\nenvironment (Karsai et al. 2004; Hemingway et al. 2011). Its framework uses\na discrete event model of computation as the common semantic framework\nfor the precise integration of an extensible range of simulation engines, using\nthe run-time infrastructure (RTI) of the high-level architecture (HLA) plat-\nform. The C2WT offers a solution for a class of multi-formalism simulation by\ndecomposing the problem into model integration and experiment or simulation\nintegration. The key characteristic of the C2WT is that a federate is created for\neach modeling formalism (e.g. a colored Petri net federate, a Simulink federate,\netc.). Once the federate for a formalism has been created, then any model that\nis consistent with that formalism can be inserted and used in the simulation.\nThese three examples (and there are many more in the literature), while work-\ning properly and achieving their goals, also indicate clearly that much more\nresearch needs to be done to establish some common standards and proce-\ndures at the physical and syntactic layers. Each of the existing computational\ntestbeds has been designed to address a specific class of problems; none of them\nare general enough to accommodate easily new formalisms. For example, the\nissue of how to deal with the interoperation of time-driven and event-driven\nmodels (hybrid systems) has not been solved in general.\nOnce a suitable testbed has been constructed implementing the physical and\nsyntactic layers, a third kind of problem needs to be addressed at the semantic\nlayer, where the interoperation of different models is examined to ensure\nthat conflicting assumptions in different modeling formalisms are recognized\nand form constraints to the exchange of data. It is not sufficient to pass\ngeolocation from one model to another; the coordinate system must be the\nsame, or an adaptor must be inserted that converts from one coordinate system\nto another.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

(2012) have\ndeveloped a meta-modeling framework. This approach extends earlier works\nby Kappel et al. (2006) and Saeki and Kaiya (2006) for a class of modeling\nformalisms primarily used for social-behavioral modeling problems. This\nframework leads to a phased approach that uses concept maps, meta-models,\nand ontologies. An ontology defines a common vocabulary for a particular\ndomain and the relationships between the elements of that vocabulary. The\napproach is not simple and requires multiple steps. It is based on comparing\nthe ontologies (for each modeling formalism) to help identify the similarities,\noverlaps, and/or mappings across the model types under consideration.\nThe fundamental idea is to deconstruct a modeling formalism into its funda-\nmental concepts. If an axiomatic approach was taken to developing a modeling\nformalism, as the case was with Forrester\u2019s (1968) system dynamics, the task\nis relatively easy. Also, if the formalism is expressed as a formal mathematical\nmodel (e.g. differential equations, Bayesian nets, colored Petri nets), then the\nbasic material exists for creating a concept map and from that a formal ontol-\nogy. The situation is much more challenging when one considers formalisms\nsuch as Social Networks, agent-based models, and probabilistic decision mod-\nels such as Influence and Timed Influence Nets. The relationships in the latter\nmodels are inferred from data or postulated by subject matter experts.\nThe approach starts by specifying a modeling formalism by constructing\ngeneralized concept maps (Novak and Ca\u00f1as 2008) that capture the assump-\ntions, definitions, elements, and their properties and relationships relevant to\nthat formalism. These concept maps address different aspects of the formalism.\nAlthough they are a structured representation, they are not formal and are\ntherefore not amenable to machine reasoning. Figure 31.4 is a concept map\naddressing the following question: What are the concepts underlying Social\nNetworks, and what are the relationships among these concepts? Figure 31.5\naddresses a different question: What are the types of analyses that can be\ncarried out with Social Network modeling, and what are the relationships\namong these analyses?\nThe concept map representation is then formalized to reveal syntactic con-\nsiderations and to lay the foundation for ontology. A basic ontology serves as\nthe foundation ontology; it does not contain semantic concepts related to the\nmodeling formalism or modeled domain but rather acts as a skeleton for the\nontology. An example for Social Networks is shown in Figure 31.6. In the next\nstep, semantic concepts and relationships are added to obtain the refactored\nontology. Refactoring modifies an ontology\u2019s structure while preserving its\nsemantics. This refactoring (accomplished with an understanding of the set\nof formalisms being treated) facilitates the next step of comparing ontologiesDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Each formalism may have its own terms for concepts that\nappear in both formalisms. Once the individual ontologies are completed,\nmapping of concepts across the ontologies is begun. The objective is to use the\nsame terminology for the same concept across the refactored ontologies\nThe refactored ontology for the Social Network formalism is shown in\nFigure 31.7.\nThe resulting overall ontology is called an enriched ontology. It should\nidentify mappings among the semantically equivalent concepts of the different\nformalisms considered so that the exchange of information or analysis results\nbetween models constructed using these formalisms can take place. The\napproach is illustrated for three formalisms in Figure 31.8. This enriched\nontology acts as the (template) knowledge container for a specific domain, and\nit can be reused, since this knowledge is in machine-readable form.\nThe refactoring of the different ontologies inside the enriched ontology is\nachieved by defining additional object properties in related classes and is done\nmanually. For instance, the Agent and Organization classes from the Social Net-\nwork refactored ontology can be mapped to the subject and object classes of\nthe Influence Net refactored ontology by adding hasSubjectValue and hasOb-\njectValue object properties to the existing object property of Agent and Orga-\nnization classes (see Table 31.1). Similarly, the Belief class in Social Network\nrefactored ontology can be mapped to Influence Net\u2019s Belief class. Table 31.1\nsummarizes these mapped concepts between both the refactored ontologies.\nThe ultimate result of this mapping is an enriched ontology that is the knowledge\ncontainer of both Influence Net and Social Network modeling techniques.\nThe enriched ontology so constructed for the modeling formalisms can be\nreasoned with using the logical theory supporting the ontological represen-\ntation (Bechhofer 2003). The mappings suggest possible semantically correct\nways to ensure consistency and to exchange information (i.e. parameter values\nand/or analysis results) between different types of models when they are used\nin a workflow addressing a specific problem of interest.\nThe enriched ontology can be represented graphically using an application\nsuch as GraphViz (2017), an open-source graph visualization software. The\nenriched ontology for Timed Influence Nets and Social Networks is shown in\nFigure 31.9.\nAnalysis of the enriched ontology indicates what types of interoperation\nare valid between models expressed in different modeling formalisms. Two\nmodels can interoperate (partially) if some concepts appear in both modeling\nformalisms and have no contradictory concepts that are invoked by the\nparticular application. By refining this approach to partition the concepts into\nmodeling formalism/language input and output concepts and also defining the\nconcepts that are relevant to the questions being asked to address the problem,\nit becomes possible to determine which sets of models can interoperate to\naddress some or all of the questions of interest and which sets of models useDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A well-known example\nof such a situation is the interoperation of system dynamics models and\nLeontief input\u2013output models. In the system dynamics formalism, the concept\nof equilibrium does not exist. Instead it supports the concept of steady state.\nConversely, the Leontief model is an equilibrium model. This limits the inter-\noperation of the two models. The key issue is whether the interoperation, as\ndefined by the workflow for a particular application, triggers the contradictory\nconcepts. If the equilibrium solution of a Leontief model is used as the initial\nstate for a system dynamics simulation, then the contradictory concepts are\nnot triggered, and the interoperation is valid.\nFinally, for semantic interoperability, models need to be interchanged across\ntools. This requires model transformations. The transformations are formally\nspecified in terms of the meta-models of the inputs and the outputs of the\ntransformations. From these meta-models and the specification of the seman-\ntic mapping, a semantic translator that implements the model transformation\nis synthesized. While much is being done on model transformation techniques,\nthis has been focused on model-based systems engineering models and much\nless on social-behavioral models. For example, one early effort to transform one\ntype of model to another (Moon 2007) focused on using the data from a Social\nNetwork to generate an Influence Net.\nThe last two paragraphs indicate two major areas for further research. For-\nmalisms used for social-behavioral modeling need to be deconstructed, their\nontologies developed and then refactored so that enriched ontologies can be\nused to develop sets of rules for valid interoperation of models developed using\nthese formalisms. The desired objective would be a set of rules that will be\nembedded in domain-specific workflow management languages that are used\nto construct and manage the simulations.\nThe Workflow Layer\nIt has been argued in this chapter that while individual modeling formalisms\nsuch as Social Networks, agent-based modeling, system dynamics, coloredDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In the previous sections, the syntactic\nand semantic challenges of the multi-formalism modeling approach were\ndiscussed. But there is one more major challenge in actually implementing\nmulti-formalism modeling and simulation: the design and implementation of\nthe workflows that enable and control the correct interoperation of the various\nmodels. At this time, the approach is domain specific, and within a domain,\ndifferent issues require different workflows.\nA multi-formalism modeling workflow is itself a model of a process for gen-\nerating data expressed as values, tables, or graphs that inform the analysis that\nis being done to support decision-making. A formal approach to capture such\na workflow requires a modeling language with its own rules. Creating work-\nflows using a domain-specific language allows for translating visual views of\nmodel interoperation into an executable implementation. There already exist\ngeneric techniques for creating and executing workflows such as Business Pro-\ncess Model and Notation (BPMN 2014) and Web Services Business Process\nExecution Language (WSBPEL 2007). Such a language would be tailored to\na problem domain of interest and would offer a high level of expressiveness.\nThis has led to the development of domain-specific multi-formalism modeling\nworkflow languages.\nThe objective is helping multi-formalism platform users in creating work-\nflows of modeling activities while guaranteeing both syntactic and semantic\ncorrectness of the resulting composition of interoperating models. The\napproach is domain specific because it is driven by the ontologies used at the\nsemantic layer. The first step consists of the identification and characterization\nof a domain of interest and the modeling formalisms that support it. The\ndomain specification identifies a region containing a number of nonempty\ncells in the construct of Figure 31.3; it specifies the types of social entities\nbeing considered, the scope of the issues being addressed, and the timeline\nor epoch of the proposed simulation. Domain analysis follows; its aim is\nto provide formal representations of syntactic and semantic aspects of the\ndomain. A new domain-specific workflow language is then developed to\nconstruct workflows that capture multi-formalism activities in the selected\ndomain. A domain ontology resulting from the domain analysis step is utilized\nto provide semantic guidance that effects valid model interoperation.\nA critical challenge concerns the scheduling of the updates in the simula-\ntion, i.e. when each interoperating model computes its new state. There are\ntwo issues: (i) great disparity in the implicit or explicit time scales (the so called\n\u0394t\u2019s) and (ii) the merging on the timeline time-driven and event-driven pro-\ncesses. This is usually done in the context of a specific domain through the\ndevelopment of a suitable scheduler that drives the simulation. This scheduler is\npart of the workflow management scheme.

As shown in Figure 31.10, the design process begins\nwith an informal description of the domain in the form of statements that iden-\ntify the issues to be addressed, the modeling formalisms to be usually used,\ndata sources and types, and main actors involved including domain experts,\nmodelers, and analysts. Then the domain boundary is identified to provide the\nbasis for excluding unrelated concepts (outside of scope). Several concept maps\n(Novak and Ca\u00f1as 2008) are constructed as a semiformal representation of the\ndomain. Generating concept maps is an iterative process until a satisfactory\ndomain representation is reached.\nThe next step is to carry out domain analysis. Class diagrams derived from\nthe concept maps are produced to capture the structural aspects of the domain.\nThen a consolidated class diagram is produced that includes interoperations\nbetween the various models being used. This consolidated class diagram serves\nas the basis for the domain-specific multi-formalism modeling workflow lan-\nguage. In addition, ontologies based on the concept maps are constructed to\ncapture the semantic aspects of the multi-formalism modeling activities. These\nontologies are then matched to construct a domain ontology.\nA development approach similar to the one presented by Mernik et al. (2005)\nis used for developing an application or subject area domain-specific language.\nIn the first phase, a decision has to be made on whether to use an existing\ngeneral-purpose language (GPL) or to develop a new domain-specific one.

In the\nsecond phase, analysis of the application domain and its constructs takes place.\nThe third phase is where the new language is designed. In general, there are two\napproaches. One way is to base a new domain-specific workflow language on an\nexisting one (language exploitation). The second approach is the invention of a\nnew language. Developing a completely new language is nontrivial; it requires\nextensive domain knowledge in addition to expertise in developing modeling\nlanguages.\nAs an example of the first approach, a new domain-specific multi-formalism\nmodeling workflow language was developed for the drug interdiction domain\nbased on the BPMN language (Abu Jbara 2013; Levis and Abu Jbara 2014).\nBPMN is a graph-based generic workflow language that provides a readily\nunderstandable notation. Its core and complete element sets allow expressing\na wide variety of workflow constructs. Figure 31.11 shows a basic set of\nmulti-formalism modeling workflow language constructs based on BPMN.\nThe task concept from BPMN was parsed into two major categories, oper-\nations and interoperations. Operations are those activities that a single model\nThin operation\nControl flow\nModel Start End Gateway\nInformation flow Adapter connection\nThick operation Interoperation Interoperation adapter\nInteroperation\nFigure 31.11 Elements of a domain-specific multi-formalism modeling workflow language\nbased on BPMN.

Interoper-\nations are those activities that involve interoperation of models expressed in\ndifferent formalisms. Operations are themselves classified as thin operations\nfor the case when modeling tools have the capability of exposing their function-\nalities as services and thick operations for the case in which a legacy modeling\ntool is used as a package. A new element, the interoperation adapter, was intro-\nduced to capture the interoperations between models.\nIn the next phase of the workflow language development process, a formal\nmeta-model of the language has to be created. This is based on the already\ndeveloped class diagram that represents the domain. This diagram with the\naddition of elements identified in Figure 31.9 becomes the basis of the language.\nOnce the language is obtained, a platform is required that would allow for both\nthe deployment of the new workflow language and its use in creating workflows.\nThe research community in this area has addressed this issue from different\nperspectives, and many approaches have been developed. However, the pro-\ncesses for developing these workflow languages are laborious and not easily\ngeneralizable. There is need to streamline such design processes and develop\ntools that enable users to customize languages to meet the needs of different\ndomains and of the interoperation of different models expressed in a wide vari-\nety of formalisms.\nIssues in Multi-formalism Modeling and Simulation\nIn addition to the research challenges in multi-formalism modeling and simu-\nlation discussed above in the context of the syntactic, semantic, and workflow\nlayers, there are more research challenges related to multi-formalism. It is use-\nful to partition them into three main topics: model representation, simulation,\nand results.\nThe Representation Problem: Information Consistency,\nRepresentability, and Sharing\nWhenever different formalisms are used together, their different natures should\ncoexist and be represented in a way that allows keeping their original seman-\ntics (representability) and keeping information fit for manipulations involving\nelements from different formalisms (sharing). The representation should offer\na common general approach to present all the information in a homogeneous\nway (consistency). One possible choice for the workflow architecture is a mod-\nular organization (hierarchical or networked) achieved by composition of het-\nerogeneous sub-models with syntactical interaction mechanisms as specified\nby the workflow.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Model transformations, typical of model-driven\nsystems engineering, use transformation description languages to implement\nmappings between different formalisms and to convert models. Transforma-\ntion descriptions operate on formalisms by specifying transformation rules\nfor elements or group of elements between formalisms: this is very suitable for\nsupporting open, vertical multi-formalism (an example is AToM 3 by de Lara\nand Vangheluwe 2002). However, if the original and target formalisms contain\ncontradictory concepts, the transformation may not be valid: thus, an analysis\nof the type described in the semantic layer discussion is essential. Developing\na set of rules embedded in the domain-specific workflow language that point\nout (and possibly prevent) inconsistent relations between models would be a\nmajor step forward.\nThe Simulation Level: Process Representation and Enactment\nThe execution engine of the composed model must support the diverse solu-\ntion processes (computations or algorithms) of the included models. With fixed\nformalism sets, the solution process could be predetermined and implicitly\ndescribed by the workflow; otherwise, it has to be described and implemented\non a case-by-case basis using proper computational engines, possibly relying\non model transformations.\nThe nature of a simulation process depends on the nature of the desired\nresults: it may produce qualitative information (e.g. behaviors) or quantitative\ninformation (e.g. probability of achieving a desired goal within a specified time\ninterval). The execution of the composed models may be based on individual\nmodel engine orchestration. In this case, engines are designed to be used\nas independent services and orchestrated as specified by the workflow or\nbusiness process (van der Aalst and ter Hofstede 2012). In this approach,\nsimulation engines are independent from the workflow engine and can be\nprovided by different experts or standalone tools. Issues of differences in time\nscales and the differences between time-driven and event-driven formalisms,\nas discussed earlier, are of paramount importance.\nThe Results Level: Local and Global Results Representation,\nTraceability, Handling, and Reuse of Intermediate Results\nThe effects of a multi-formalism modeling-based simulation process may gen-\nerate results that are local to some model elements or global. A correct repre-\nsentation of the results that is easily interpretable by the user requires a formal\nspecification related to the nature of the formalisms, the workflow specifica-\ntion, and the simulation process. As the nature of desired results substantiallyDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The main problems are traceability (that is, the possi-\nbility of mapping back to a given component model the data obtained by the\nsimulation process) and management of results that are generated by the com-\nposed model and not the individual component models. A general approach\nto addressing this problem is lacking, and while in each case a unique repre-\nsentation of results has been effected, the development of tools that enable the\nconstruction of the visualization of the results (sometimes such tools are called\nviewers) would be very helpful.\nConclusions\nTo address in a holistic way social-behavioral problems, a single model\nexpressed in a single formalism is usually not sufficient. Different social\ntheories and different behavioral models have been developed, and each one\nof them offers some unique insights into the problem of interest but ignores\nother aspects. Multi-formalism modeling and simulation, when done prop-\nerly, enables the valid composition and execution of interoperating models\nexpressed in different modeling formalisms. While substantial research has\nbeen done in investigating the diverse challenges that multi-formalism poses\nand some key results have been obtained, more work needs to be done to\nanalyze some of the prevailing formalisms and develop rules that will help\nresearchers expand the range of questions they can ask by composing models\nand executing them on platforms or testbeds correctly. Specific research\nchallenges have been identified in the description of the syntactic, semantic,\nand workflow layers, and in the last section, broader challenges have been\nidentified, aimed at making multi-formalism modeling and simulation acces-\nsible to researchers working on social-behavioral systems. The current results\nare limited by being domain specific; whether these can be generalized to\nbecome domain independent appears to be a goal too far at this time. The\nchallenges, for example, of using engineering models interoperating with\nsocial-behavioral models require much careful thought.\nEpilogue\nIn the study applying these methods to the scenario described in Prologue,\ninvestigating potential COA for de-escalating the crisis between India and\nPakistan, independent analyses were conducted for CENTCOM and PACOM\nusing the structure of Figure 31.1 but with the appropriate region-specific\nmodels. A number of possible actions and their timing were considered.

The results\nwere not encouraging. The probability that US actions would help de-escalate\nthe crisis was very small. However, when the CENTCOM and PACOM\nmodels for COA development and assessment were merged, thus enabling\nthe development of coordinated COAs by the two US Regional Commands,\nthe situation improved. Both countries seemed to be willing to de-escalate for\na while depending on their adversary\u2019s actions. But if forces were engaged,\nthen the likelihood that Pakistan would escalate, including preparations for\na nuclear option, increased. This was consistent with Pakistan\u2019s state policy.\nComputational experimentation that varied timing enabled the ordering of\nthe multi-state activities for maximum combined effect. The analyses also\nshowed that the timing of the US actions was critical. Once the crisis had\nstarted escalating, it was very difficult to de-escalate. Early action was essential\nwith rapid involvement of the senior leaders in the United States interacting\nwith the senior leadership in the two belligerents. Furthermore, through\nthe Social Network analysis and agent-based modeling, it became clear that\nprior relationships between US leaders and leaders in the two countries were\nessential for rapid high-level interactions. Although the experiments were\nbased on imperfect simulation, these insights appeared valid.\nReferences\nAbu Jbara, A. (2013). On using multi-modeling and meta-modeling to address\ncomplex systems.

Carley\nInstitute of Software Research, School of Computer Science and Engineering and Public Policy,\nCarnegie Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA\nIntroduction\nSocial-behavioral simulation is often turned to as a way of reasoning about\nthe human condition and thinking through what might happen under various\ninterventions. Potential advantages include overcoming human decision bias,\nthinking through a large number of alternative situations, and reasoning about\ncontext and over periods of time that are too complex for the human unaided by\nthe computation to reason about. While these advantages exist, simulation of\ncomplex social-behavioral systems is not routine. Nor are the simulation mod-\nels, necessarily, accurate reflections of reality. There are more creditable models\nwhere the logics built into the model reflect established theory or empirical reg-\nularities. Yet despite best efforts, the logics in these models may reflect human\nbiases. Further, in many simple models and in those where no theory exists,\nthe model may actually reflect simply the potentially nonsensicle opinions of\nthe creators.\nAgent-based (e.g. Bonabeau 2002; Davidsson 2002; van Dam et al. 2012),\nevent history (Box-Steffensmeier and Jones 2004), Petri net (Tabak and Levis\n1985; Murata 1989), and system dynamic models (Sterman 2001; Mohaghegh\nand Mosleh 2009) are generally used as the simulation frameworks when mod-\neling complex systems in the social sciences. No one methodology is proving\nadequate, so the field is moving toward hybrid modeling and a system of sys-\ntems approach using interoperable models. These models make explicit the\ngaps in underlying theories; support theory comparison, integration, and devel-\nopment; and enable users to create a framework in which they can rapidly rea-\nson about alternative explanations (useful forensically) or alternative courses of\naction (useful for planning) (Gilbert and Troitzsch 2005).\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

It is difficult to predict\nthe effects of actions on them and to predict when new events will occur within\nthem. Social-behavioral systems are classic examples of complex systems. How-\never, they also represent a special case of complexity because humans, who can\nlearn, are key elements of social-behavioral systems.\nThe field of simulation and the validation of simulations have their roots\nin shop floor management and operations research. Most of the approaches\nto model development, the theory of validation, and the expectations for how\nmodels operate are based on an operations research conception predicated on\nmodels of physical systems. Key assumptions underlying that body of work\ninclude stationarity of process and the corollary that components do not learn.\nThese assumptions are violated in social-behavioral systems. Consequently,\nthe traditional science of validation does not apply, and a new science is\nneeded (National Research Council 2006, 2008). Developing such a science\nwill depend on meeting a number of challenges both in terms of how to\ncommunicate social-behavioral models and their results and how to develop\nsuch models to create reusable and scalable technologies.\nKey Communication Challenges\nIndependent of the scientific challenges, there are a number of communica-\ntion challenges faced by those interested in developing and using simulation to\naddress complex social-behavioral systems. These challenges take the forms of\ncognitive biases that humans have when they try to understand the results of\nmodels and the models themselves. Two of these will be considered:\nConsumer bias: Human consumers of simulations are themselves humans\nand so have a tendency to assume that they know how humans behave. In\ncontrast, many humans have placed physics on a pedestal, have deep-seated\nmath anxiety, and assume that mechanical and engineered systems are\nhard to understand. This creates a situation where the consumers of\nsocial-behavioral models think they should be able to understand and agree\nwith models of human activities, but do not make the same assumption for\nphysical system models. A consequence is that social-behavioral models are\nheld to a higher standard vis-\u00e0-vis communication than other models.\nStorytelling bias: Humans have a tendency to think they understand how some-\nthing works when they can tell a story about it. Storytelling is a cognitive\ncrutch by which we keep track of the order in which things occur and the\nrelations among things. The more complex the story, the harder it is to recall.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Complex mod-\nels, such as EpiSims (Mniszewski et al. 2008) or BioWar (Carley et al. 2006),\ndo not lend themselves to such simple stories. Humans are also more likely\nto view as accurate models they think they understand. A result is that con-\nsumers of the NK model and the garbage can model think they understand\nhow the models work and are more likely to view them as credible and accu-\nrate when, in fact, they really do not understand the scope conditions and the\nmodels themselves cannot be validated. In contrast, more complex models,\neven if they are validated, are harder to tell stories about, are less likely to be\nviewed as understandable, and so are less likely to be viewed as credible.\nKey Scientific Challenges\nIndependent of the communication challenges, there are a number of scientific\nchallenges faced by those interested in developing and using simulation to\naddress complex social-behavioral systems. Overcoming these challenges is\ncritical for creating scalable, reusable social-behavioral simulation systems\nand for reducing the high cost of developing credible simulation systems.\nThese key challenges center around speed of development, reuse, and\napproaches to validation.

Rather than providing a detailed discussion of\neach challenge, three issues that apply to multiple challenges will be discussed:\nModel granularity: Social-behavioral systems are often reasoned about,\nexplained, and measured at different levels of granularity. Among the levels\nof granularity of interest are time (minute, day, week, year), space (block,\ncity, county, country), agent group (neuron, person, decision-making unit,\norganization, nation), and knowledge group (word, concept, topic, theme).\nTypically models that are accurate or designed for one level of granularity do\nnot work at other levels of granularity. For example, models that are accurate\nat the cognitive and task level do not scale to the community or even large\ngroup level, whereas models that are informative about populations are\ninaccurate at the cognitive level. One reason for this is that the logics of\ninteraction may change fundamentally with scale. Basic research on how\nlogics change with scale is needed. Another reason for this is that the\naggregation processes and disaggregation processes needed as one moves\nup and down the levels of granularity are not known. Two advances in\nthis area are dynamic network modeling and social cognition modeling\n(Morgan et al. 2017). Dynamic network models provide a mechanism\nwhereby the pattern of interaction among the components can be used\nto affect the decision logic or behavior of the component whose internal\nlogic can also be represented as a network (networks where the nodes\nare networks). Social cognition is a set of mechanisms whereby individual\nhumans make sense of the world by reasoning not about every individual\nbut about collectives in the same way they reason about individuals. This\nincludes social cognitive mechanisms such as recognizing and responding\nto a generalized other, inferring individual traits from perceptions about\na group, generalizing group traits from activities of an individual, and\nrecalling average rather than actual behavior. Focusing on these types of\nlogics that support connecting one level of a model with another is critical\nfor improved model accuracy and reuse.\nLevel of validation: Historically, the science of validation has treated validation\nas a single process. A model was either valid or not, and there was a single\napproach to validation. In contrast, for social-behavioral simulations it is\ngenerally recognized that there are multiple levels or types of validation\nand that the level of relevance and the extent of validation depend on the\nmodel\u2019s purpose (Burton 2003; National Research Council 2008). There\nare various ways of characterizing the various aspects of validation. For\nexample, Davis and O\u2019Mahony (2019) describe the components as being\ndescription, explanation, postdiction, coarse exploration, and prediction.\nAn alternative approach is to think in terms of the empirical precision at\nwhich the model is validated and/or matched to the predictions of anotherDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Still more\ndetailed schemes exist that take into account the number of features on\nwhich to validate, the level of empirical match, and the extent of revalidation\n(Yahja and Carley 2005). To move forward with a science of validation\nfor social-behavioral simulations, a validation framework is needed that\naccounts both for the various components of validation, the purpose of the\nmodel, the level of empirical match, and the nature of the underlying data to\nsupport match. See also another paper in this volume discussing validation\n(Grace et al. 2019).\nIdentifying the right level and type of validation for a model is further\ncomplicated in a reuse model\u2013expansion situation. The crux of the problem\nhas to do with interaction among subtheories. Most social-behavioral\nsimulations are at their core multi-theoretical. Typically the way in which\nthese theories linked together is not known. Model development often\nmeans suggesting a theory for these gaps. Validation then becomes a process\nof creating an empirically grounded mega-theory (e.g. see Schreiber and\nCarley 2004). This is counter to another assumption of traditional validation\nscience, which assumes that the theory is known and well specified. This is\none of the gaps through which human biases creep into these models. In a\nrelated vein, typically social-behavioral simulations are built in a building\nblock fashion. That is, the basic model is built, possibly validated, and used\nto explore an issue. Then the model is reused, generally expanded on, and\nthe process repeats. The issue here is that as models are expanded, the earlier\nparts of the model may no longer behave as they did previously. This is par-\nticularly true in nonlinear complex systems. This means that the results of\nearlier validation exercises may no longer hold, hence, leading to a situation\nwhere the model needs to be revalidated for each reuse/expansion situation.\nValidation vs. tuning: Historically, the science of validation for simulation has\nbeen based around two assumptions: stationarity of process and measura-\nbility. Stationarity of process means that you can collect a data set from time\nperiod N or machine y and tune the model until you get a high level of pre-\ndictive accuracy (e.g. 98%). Tuning is done by changing internal processes in\nthe model. The resultant model is considered validated and can then be used\nto predict the behavior of the system at other time periods or the behav-\nior of objects from comparable machines. Social-behavioral system violates\nthis assumption. Consequently, tuning the model to a historic case study is\nactually overfitting. The resultant model is then fragile and unlikely to apply\nin other situations. Consider, for example, the artificial intelligence/machine\nlearning (AI/ML) models, particularly those that require training sets. Such\nmodels typically use data from a single context/time period and split it into\ntwo sets. The model is built based on the first part of the data and then\napplied to the second part. Accuracy of such models can become quite highDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, if moved into the wild and used in other\ncontexts, they often will not work, and/or the accuracy can decrease dra-\nmatically due to the nonstationarity of process.\nSimply tuning a model to two historical cases is not a sufficient solution.\nRecall that as a model is reused from one situation to the next, new modules are\noften added. A possible consequence is that if a model is tuned to one histori-\ncal case and then reused, expanded, and tuned to a second case, the model may\nno longer be tuned to the first case. In complex social-behavioral simulations,\nthe relationship between model components and validation is so complicated\nthat special artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be needed to track and predict\nwhich parts of the model will become invalidated as the model is expanded and\nretuned (Yahja and Carley 2005).\nAnother assumption of the traditional science of validation is measurabil-\nity; i.e. it is possible to delineate all aspects of the physical system and mea-\nsure its properties. Social-behavioral systems violate this assumption in part\nbecause we often cannot know what people are thinking, particularly in situa-\ntions where people themselves are unable to forecast their own behavior \u2013 such\nas life-threatening situations. For these and other reasons, such as measure-\nment imprecision, and propagating measurement errors, predictive accuracy\n(i.e. predicting future behavior) of social-behavioral models is often much lower\nthan those for physical systems. While ML/AI models often claim they are\ndoing prediction \u2013 as was noted \u2013 the high accuracy they achieve is often using\ndata from the same time period and context as they were tuned (i.e. trained) on\nand rarely have this high a level of prediction for future events.\nFor such reasons, simulation often plays a different role in the social-\nbehavioral context than in the physical system context. Its value is in forecast-\ning, not prediction. In other words, social-behavioral simulations are generally\nthe most useful for describing the space of future possibilities and the relative\nlikelihood of particular outcomes. Trying to express this difference to policy-\nmakers and those not steeped in simulation is difficult for a variety of reasons\n(see also Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2019). First is the terminology. As was alluded\nto the term, prediction means, depending on the user, a priori predicting a spe-\ncific event in the future (aka point prediction), explaining behavior in one part\nof the data given the other part of the data, and a priori estimating the relative\nlikelihood of different outcomes (aka probabilistic forecast). Similarly the term\nprediction also has been used to mean extrapolation (as is often done with\nregression models), suggesting possibilities (aka qualitative forecast), equiv-\nalent to prediction, and a priori estimating the relative likelihood of different\noutcomes (aka probabilistic forecast or prediction). Using this terminology,\nthe difference can be described as simulation of physical systems as being\nmore capable of point prediction and simulation of social-behavioral systems\nas being more capable of probabilistic forecasting or qualitative forecasting.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

That\nis, the vast majority of physical system simulations support point prediction.\nCertainly the science of validation is designed for this type of prediction. In\ncontrast, the vast majority of social-behavioral simulations support either prob-\nabilistic forecasting or qualitative forecasting. For those few social-behavioral\nsimulations that can do point prediction, they do so only under specific scope\nconditions. At this point a science of validation that supports forecasting does\nnot exist in its entirety. Further, the tactics and techniques needed to determine\nwhether the scope conditions and the logics in social-behavioral simulations\nare such that they will support point prediction are understood more in the\nabstract than in practice. For example, stationarity of process is needed, but\nmeasuring it is often an open challenge.\nToward a New Science of Validation\nA consequence of these considerations is that a new science of validation is\nneeded for social-behavioral modeling. At the heart of such a science is the\npractice of validation in parts and incremental validation, instead of tuning.\nValidation in parts means that parts of the model (the input, the outputs,\nand the internal processes) are validated separately, often on different data\nand sometimes by different teams. Three factors are needed: (i) inputs of the\nmodel have been shown to have at least the same distributional properties\nas real world. In the limit the input data for the model are exactly real-world\ndata streams and/or empirically derived from real-world sensors. Under the\nphilosophy that the model should be able to do the task it seeks to explain, the\nmodel must take as input the exact data that the real-world social-behavioral\nsystem would. Models that fit these criteria could, in principle, be substitute\nfor the social-behavioral system in other contexts (much as AI personal\nshoppers could substitute for a human personal shopper). (ii) The distribution\nof model outputs contains, as special cases, historic examples. However, this\ndoes not imply that the mean prediction of the model should agree with the\nhistorical data point. Indeed if the model contains discontinuities in some\nof the variables, the mean prediction of the model might be a situation that\nlogically cannot exist. Logically, one would expect that as the number of\nhistorical cases increases, the distribution of historical data points should\ncome to reflect the plausibility distribution from the simulation. (iii) Internal\nprocesses in the model have been shown to match at some level to processes\nobserved in the real world. This match might be very qualitative as when\nconfirming the face validity of a model by claiming that each element has an\nanalog in the real world. Or this match might be strongly empirical and precise\nusing exact values in equations that match the equations used to describe\nthe real world.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Incremental validation is an approach meant to over-\ncome the high level of complexity and the extensive number of variables and\nprocesses needed to explain social behavior. For incremental validation a set of\nfeatures to be validated are identified. This set is often modularized by granular-\nity level, or theory being operationalized, or data context. The model is built and\nit is validated against the base features. Then new modules/theories are added,\nand the model is revalidated against the old features and also validated against\nthe new set of features. A key advantage of this approach is that it allows theory\nto be developed to fill in the gaps linking different levels of granularity. Another\nadvantage is that this approach does not require a universal perfect data set, but\nenables the simulationists and the consumers to make use of large diverse sets\nof data from multiple sources and contexts that may or may not be fusible.\nA science of validation appropriate for social-behavioral simulation may\nbe well served by the development of a model social agent (Carley and\nNewell 1994). The model social agent is a conceptual framework that defines\nthe elements of a social agent and what behavior should emerge from any\nmodel containing agents composed of those elements. A first attempt in this\ndirection was forwarded by Carley and Newell (1994). While not sufficient, the\nsuggested framework shows the power of having such a model in providing\nguidance for what models should and should not be able to do and so what\ntype of and level of validation might be needed.\nConclusion\nThe state of the art in simulation of complex social-behavioral systems has\nadvanced in the past several decades. Gone are the days of all models being\nrational actor models. Gone are the days of model assessment being done by\ngenerating a single simulation run, viewing the results, and stating that \u201cit looks\nright.\u201d That being said, the field needs some serious advances to become more\nmainstream. Overcoming some of the challenges described herein will help.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that these are simulations of com-\nplex social behavior. It is unreasonable to expect rapid development, high lev-\nels of accuracy, and high levels of reuse when the subject being modeled is\nstill so poorly understood. The laws governing human interaction, learning,\nsocial engagement, and cognition are still being discovered. Each new discovery\nincreases the value of and the ease of building simulations and validating them.\nIn that sense, advancing the field of simulation is codependent with advancing\nour understanding of human social behavior.\nIt is also important to recognize that humans and the groups or communities\nthey form are an evolving system. This suggests that the simulations themselvesDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

With complex and evolving systems, ensemble approaches\nare often of value. For example, major advances in weather forecasting occurred\nonce sets of models were used in an ensemble fashion to provide estimates.\nStandardization in output formats and levels of granularity for outputs enabled\ncross-fertilization. Such an approach may do well in the social-behavioral con-\ntext as well.\nA final approach is that social-behavioral modeling is big science. Strong,\nreusable systems require substantial resources to be developed. Large teams\nare needed to develop and fuse the data needed for model development and\nvalidation, for building the infrastructure and tool chains for using models\nin an interoperable fashion, to run virtual experiments using the model to\nexamine results, and to describe and document the model. The infrastructure\naround the model needed to ensure its use requires more people and more\ntime than the model design and development itself. If we continue to think\nof social-behavioral simulation as being comparable with running a statistical\nanalysis of a moderate data set, progress in this area will be slow.\nReferences\nAxtell, R., Axelrod, R., Epstein, J.M., and Cohen, M.D. (1996).

Rather, it is argued, when simulations\nhave claimed to do so, the emergence was actually baked in. What are your\nthoughts on this issue, both in assessing the current situation and in looking\nforward?\nRespondents: Kathleen M. Carley, Paul K. Davis, Joshua M. Epstein, Levent Yil-\nmaz, Luke J. Matthews, Theodore P. Pavlic, William Rand, Scott Neal Reilly,\nAndreas Tolk, Samarth Swarup, and Raffaele Vardavas\nContributors differed on whether simulations can generate true emergence\nbut differed also on what true means. Andreas Tolk, Kathleen M. Carley, and\nJoshua M. Epstein argue that, of course, the outputs of simulation can only\nreflect the simulation\u2019s structure and inputs. That said, the simulation outputs\ncan be highly important and beyond human capacity to anticipate without\nthe help of models. Luke J. Matthews, Levent Yilmaz, Samarth Swarup, and\nRaffaele Vardavas \u2013 without disputing that a simulation\u2019s output is determined\nby its inputs and structure \u2013 note evidence of distinctly nonobvious emergence\nin simulations. Swarup argues that as our ability to build more clever agents\nimproves, we will see increasingly profound emergent phenomena, often the\nresult of agent learning. Levent Yilmaz notes that macro behavior may not\neven be describable in the vocabulary of the simulation that generates it and\nposits a need to develop meta-protocols defined in terms of the attractor space\nof the model. Some contributors define emergence as requiring surprise, i.e.\nunanticipated behavior. That ties emergence to human knowledge. Others\nreject that definition because many emergent phenomena (in their definition)\nexist independent of human knowledge and because the phenomenon doesn\u2019t\nchange merely because we come to understand it.\nOur contributors also explored the value of simulating emergence. Paul K.\nDavis argues that a particularly valuable role for simulation is to reproduce\nemergence observed empirically, so as to understand it, but sees doing so as\noften being in the class of hard problems. Scott Neal Reilly argues for using\nsimulation to \u201cexplore the space of tradeoffs and configurations that are consis-\ntent with the phenomenon.\u201d Ted Pavlic extends this, arguing that \u201cultimately,\nsimulations of emergent phenomena should only be employed as part of a sci-\nentific process: testing a hypothesis on the mechanisms underlying observed\nemergent phenomena or generating new plausible hypotheses that may lead to\nfurther \u2018real-world\u2019 experimentation.\u201d\nA number of contributions appeared initially to be fundamentally con-\ntradictory. We concluded, however, that the contradictions had origins in\n(i) the definition of emergence (Do only surprising phenomena count?), (ii)\nthe emotive meaning of baked-in (Can something baked in be profoundly\nnonobvious and important?), and (iii) whether some forms of real-world\nemergence generate something not understandable even in principle byDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Some phenomena are in principle understandable, but\nonly after accounting for learning and adaptation over time, perhaps including\nconsequences of so-called downward causality. If the reader keeps these issues\nand distinctions in mind, the relationships among contributions will be clearer.\nWe did not attempt to reconcile the contributions through editing because we\nwanted to preserve the spirit of the initial language.\nAndreas Tolk: Epistemological, Not Ontological Emergence\nNatural complex adaptive systems (CASs) may produce something new, like\nstructures, patterns, or properties, that arise from the rules of self-organization.\nThese novelties are emergent if they cannot be understood as any property of\nthe components, but are new properties of the system. One of the leading meth-\nods to better understand CAS is the use of their computational representation\nin simulations and predominantly in agent-based approaches.\nComputational science disciplines, such as computational physics, biology,\nchemistry, and social science, explore the use computer models in their\nresearch. The discipline of complex systems research benefitted significantly\nfrom these developments, as computers amplified our abilities to model, sim-\nulate, and evaluate the computational twins of the natural systems of interest.\nThe principal steps of such a computational study of CASs were captured in\ndetail by Holland (1992) and elaborated by many authors since then.\nBut can these digital twins produce emergence? To answer this question,\nit is necessary to understand the difference between epistemological and\nontological emergence. In the epistemological view, emergent properties and\nlaws are systemic features of complex systems. Such a system is governed\nby true, law-like generalizations within a special science that is irreducible\nto fundamental physical theory for conceptual reasons. As such, this view\ncharacterizes the concept of emergence strictly in terms of limits on human\nknowledge of complex systems. The unpredictability is a matter of human\nknowledge, not a characteristic of the systems. The ontological view is quite\ndifferent. Here, the emergent properties are independent of the human knowl-\nedge about them. Instead they are novel, fundamental types of properties\naltogether. Something new emerges that was not there before, and that cannot\nbe explained by the components and their interactions and relations alone.\nSo, what can we use computer simulations for? The famous artificial\nintelligence researcher Hubert L. Dreyfus (1972, 1992) is well known for\nhis two books on the limits and constraints of computers. Dreyfus points\nto known limits that are founded in the nature of computers as captured\nin the works of Turing, Church, G\u00f6del, and other pioneers of computer\n1 In the philosophical literature, the examples sometimes given for such pure emergence include\nconsciousness and quantum mechanical phenomena, such as action at a distance (Clayton and\nDavies 2006; O\u2019Connor and Wong 2015).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These constraints are\nstill valid, and they are valid for computational simulations even of CASs.\nAlthough computers have improved significantly over the recent years, the\nessential constraint remains: computers can only transform input parameters\ninto output parameters using computable functions to do so. As a result,\ncomputers cannot create something new out of nothing, as everything that\nis produced by a computer must be in the input data or the transforming\nalgorithm. They cannot produce ontological emergence!\nHowever, computational simulations of CAS can reproduce epistemologi-\ncal emergence, and more importantly, they can reduce epistemological emer-\ngence by increasing the knowledge about the system: what we understand with\nthe help of the simulation system is no longer emergent! As such, simulations\nare utmost important in support of gaining scientific knowledge and provide\nalso practical support in the form of tools, but they can\u2019t produce ontological\nemergence.\nKathleen M. Carley: Emergence Does Not Happen Magically\nin Simulations or the Real World\nIn practice, two types of emergence have sometimes been confused:\n(1) Emergence due to complexity: In this case, the emergent behavior is a rela-\ntion between two or more variables or agents in the model that was not a\npriori predicted by the simulationists nor known to be predicated on the\ntheory being captured by the model. Such behaviors are often the result\nof a complex chain of interactions, or dependent on a large number of\ninteracting variables, so that most humans, unaided by computational tech-\nniques, cannot think through all the interactions and possibilities. This type\nof emergence is one of the hallmarks of simulation models that are devel-\noped by integrating multiple previously unconnected theories.\n(2) Emergence due to level of analysis: Here the emergent behavior is a pat-\ntern of activity at a granularity distinct from (and usually coarser than) the\none at which the model is programmed. Micro-level actions then can have\nunanticipated macro-level results. The classical example is when a flock of\nbirds is simulated with rules that say they can only turn right or left 90\u2218, or\ngo straight. Simulation output shows the flock appearing to move at a 45\u2218\nangle. In principle, there should be a parallel version of emergence in which\nmacro-level constraints result in micro-level adaptations, but this has been\nless examined by simulationists.\nThe notion that there is a kind of real emergence where results are not related\nto the simulation or learning algorithms does not make sense. For human soci-\neties, things that emerge don\u2019t just happen magically but follow from and have\ntheir explanations in the way that humans learn and interact, and due to the\nchanges of their physical or sociocultural environment. The same should be so\nfor simulations.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Epstein: Of Course, Emergent Phenomena Are Baked into\nComputer Models\nI am asked this question frequently, and usually rhetorically, the suggestion\nbeing that, if baked in, a result can be dismissed as somehow trivial, uninterest-\ning, already known, not useful, or some such.\nFirst, regarding the fraught term emergent, I have previously discussed its\nlogical confusions, deistic origins, anti-scientific implications, and a proces-\nsion of withering philosophical criticisms from Bertrand Russell to Hebert\nSimon (Epstein 1999). Luckily, the panel question does not actually require a\nresolution of this hoary debate.\nHowever, to address the panel question coherently, two clarifications are\nessential. First, whatever may be one\u2019s definition of emergence, the question\nitself presupposes that the emergent phenomena of (putative) interest here are\nstates or outputs of a computational simulation, and not states in the biological\ndevelopment of a human embryo, or of phase transitions from liquid to a gas,\nin which connections the term emergent is also encountered.\nSecond, let us agree that (as most inquisitors would) that baked in means\n\u201cmechanically attained after a finite number of model iterations.\u201d\nUnder these two structures, my answer to the panel question is, \u201cOf course,\nemergent phenomena are baked in, because they are computer outputs, and\ncomputer outputs are baked into the code!\u201d Perhaps pedantically,\n\u2022 Premise 1: All (putatively) emergent phenomena are simulation states/\noutputs (assumed by the panel question).\n\u2022 Premise 2: All computer states/outputs are baked into the code.\n\u2022 Therefore, Conclusion: All (putatively) emergent phenomena are baked in to\nthe code (Syllogistic).\nOnly Premise 2 requires discussion. If we are given a simulation\u2019s initial con-\nditions, parameters, and updating (inference) rules, then every state is attained\nby strict deduction (Epstein 1999). That is, every computational model can be\nwritten in Turing Machine code, and for every Turing Machine there is a unique\nequivalent set of equations (in partial recursive functions). Therefore, every\nattainable state can be strictly (recursively) deduced and is therefore baked in.\nIndeed, all the immortal proofs in mathematics are demonstrations that some\nproposition, the theorem, is baked in to the axioms. That hardly makes the\ntheorem trivial.\nImagine attending Andrew Wiles\u2019 Princeton colloquium revealing that \u2013 after\n300 years of failed attempts by the greatest of mathematicians \u2013 he had finally\nproved Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. Who in their right mind would raise their\nhand and skeptically quip, \u201cBut Professor Wiles, wasn\u2019t that just baked into\nthe Axioms?\u201d Of course it was baked in. Therein lies the miracle!

The Schelling model\nshows (remarkably) that a macroscopic segregated state is baked into seemingly\nremote micro-rules. Conway\u2019s Life \u201cgliders\u201d are baked in to the seeming remote\nCellular Automaton rules. This is the entire point: to discover the seemingly\nremote micro-rules that generate, or bake in, the macro-phenomenon.\nOne might well ask, \u201cWhat about randomness?\u201d Staying with food analo-\ngies, this is a red herring. Elsewhere, I note that on computers we simulate\nrandomness with deterministic so-called pseudorandom number generators\n(Epstein 2006). We do this to ensure that we can replicate runs of particular\ninterest. If we use the same random number seed, we will get exactly the\nsame run. So, every particular stochastic realization is again a strict deduction\nand is baked in. Even if one uses naturally occurring random numbers (from\natmospheric phenomena, or radioactive decay), if one wants to replicate the\nrun, the random string thus harvested must still be saved. But, if we use the\nsaved string, the result is again baked in. If one uses an unreproducible random\nstring, then the most that can be provably \u201cbaked in\u201d is a statistical distribution\nover a set of individually unreproducible runs (by maximum entropy methods,\nfor example).\nOf potential interest could be \u201cGarden of Eden\u201d states. I believe this term was\nintroduced by John Tukey, to denote states that satisfy some criterion, such as\nbeing an equilibrium, but are not attainable from any other state of the system\nunder the rules of the game (Epstein and Hammond 2002). Of these configu-\nrations, one might say that their existence is baked into the axioms, but their\nattainment \u2013 and so their emergence \u2013 is baked out!\nIn any case, I hope it is clear that the assertion under discussion is itself\nhalf-baked at best!\nLevent Yilmaz: Emergent Behavior May Have a Higher-Level Ontology\nEmergence is a consequence of the interaction of the rules, which are indeed\ndesigned. That does not mean that model developers preordain or determine\nthe emergent outcome. The emergent behavior may even have a higher-level\nontology with constructs that are not defined in the vocabulary of the model.\nThe concept of the formation of a group, which is an emergent regularity, may\nnot even be phrased in terms of the composition of constructs of the model\nthat generates it. Conway\u2019s Game of Life is particularly revealing. The oscilla-\ntors, spaceships, and gliders are not even remotely related to the four basic rules\nof the game. Similarly, a weather prediction model that simulates the dynam-\nics of gas molecules while using terms such as pressure and temperature may\ngenerate a hurricane. However, hurricanes may not have been engineered as\na construct into the model. Instead, the interactions of the rules among each\nother as well as with the continuously evolving environment determines the\npatterns that result. I suspect that recognition of emergent behavior and using\nit effectively within the model will require meta-protocols, which are definedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The emergent behavior may even\nfeedback in the form of positive and negative feedback to further constrain the\napplication of the rules. They are not engineered into the model. Emergence can\nbe both surprising, allowing us to learn from a model, or expected, enabling us\nto justify the model. These are not contradictory views of emergence. Both are\nuseful.\nSamarth Swarup: The Promise of Clever Agents for True Emergence\nin Simulations\nThere are multiple perspectives about emergence. The simplest is that we do\nsimulations to compute the population-level consequences of individual behav-\niors. This makes sense to do only if the outcomes aren\u2019t obvious or known\nalready. If so, outcomes are emergent. This can be tied to the notion of com-\nputational irreducibility, which refers to computations where the fastest way\nof determining the outcome is to run the program (i.e. there is or seems to\nbe no simpler way to predict the outcomes from the initial conditions). In this\nview, a simulation is a way of knowing and, indeed, may be the fastest way of\nknowing. This is the epistemological perspective. In practice, this applies to any\nreasonably complex social simulation.\nNow let\u2019s consider a particular scenario. Imagine a simulation of the after-\nmath of a nuclear explosion. Suppose that a lot of people rush toward ground\nzero to find family members. This is risky because of radiation and fallout. Sup-\npose further that there are a number of healthcare locations where people can\nbe treated to some degree for radiation sickness. This might lead to a feedback\nloop where people search for family members until they get sick, whereupon\nthey get treated and then start looking for family members again, and so on. If\nthe simulation is set up right, we would see emergence of a density dependence\non health outcomes. Put simply, if people are falling sick faster than they can\nrecover, most people will end up sick, whereas if they are being treated faster\nthan they are falling sick, most people would end up in good health. If the\nsize of the area and the number of healthcare locations are fixed, this would\nmanifest as a function of the population density. This is not a relationship\nprogrammed into the simulation; it emerges from the interactions between the\nagents and the environment. This is the ontological perspective in which emer-\ngence is due to law-like relationships arising from interactions in a system. This\ncan be particularly satisfying if a number of complex micro-level interactions\neffectively cancel out, so that the system can be described simply at a macro\nlevel (as when molecular interactions aggregate so that a fluid can be described\nas a function of just three variables: pressure, volume, and temperature).\nIn a complex social simulation, we generally do not observe such simple\nbehavior at the population level. However, such a relationship may be embed-\nded in a web of other behaviors, interactions, and environmental effects.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n760 Panel Discussion: Moving Social-Behavioral Modeling Forward\nAdditional work is then necessary to identify the relationships that emerge\nand the generating mechanisms. This is an open simulation analytics question,\nwhere new methods are needed. Once we have such methods, a third kind of\nemergence will become possible. Suppose that we design agents that are sophis-\nticated enough to alter their behaviors based on observed population-level\nrelationships that emerge from the simulation. For example, suppose that the\nagents are allowed to observe the density dependence of health outcomes in\nthe example above. This could be possible by observing the number of people\nfalling sick in different subregions that have different population densities.\nParticularly clever agents could then choose to shelter if they find themselves\nin areas of high population density, thus avoiding falling sick. This would\nbe an example of the emergence of downward causation, where emergent\nmacro-level phenomena exert a causal influence on micro-level behaviors. This\nis sometimes referred to as true emergence. There are important technical chal-\nlenges to be solved before we can build a simulation of this type. These include\nthe emergence discovery problem, i.e. how to find emergent relationships and\nhow to design agents that can take advantage of such relationships.\nLuke J. Matthews: Examples of True Emergence in Current\nAgent-Based Models\nYes, clearly some agent-based models have demonstrated true emergence.\nDefinitely there are socio-behavioral simulations in which the emergent\nphenomenon is not baked in.\nTwo examples would be my work on cultural traditions in capuchin mon-\nkeys (Franz and Matthews 2010) and Charlie Nunn\u2019s work on simulating the\nmain cognitive features people talk about with regard to culture, including peer\npressure and prestige bias (Nunn et al. 2009). Capuchin monkeys can produce\ngroup-typical traditions even though they have no peer pressure (a.k.a. confor-\nmity bias), no sense of group norms or group identity, and no ability to faithfully\nimitate. This is because when building a model with both basic reinforcement\nlearning (operant conditioning) and even the simplest social learning mecha-\nnism (social enhancement), and letting them interact, produces group-typical\ntraditions! But, group typical-ness is not instantiated in the cognitive capacity\neither for reinforcement learning or enhancement learning.\nCharlie Nunn built an agent-based model with cognitive mechanisms\nthat people like Boyd and Richerson and Joe Henrich have focused on for\nculture \u2013 including conformity bias and prestige bias. What Nunn found is\nthat when natural selection acted on a cultural trait, and that is represented\nin a spatially explicit social system along with cognitive characteristics, the\ncognitive characteristics essentially had no effect on the emergent dynamics of\nthe system because migration dynamics and selection were 800 lb gorillas\ncompared to them. So, although people evolved to have these cognitive biasesDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nSimulation and Emergence 761\nbecause they are adaptive for them individually, the cognitive biases have\nvirtually no impact on the emergent epidemiological dynamics at least for\nfitness-relevant traits. That\u2019s still not a popular idea because in the evolution\nof culture literature it is popular to fixate on cognitive mechanisms. This\ncognitive focus seems especially deeply rooted among Western researchers\nwho approach the work from individualist cultural traditions.\nSo, in my mind a researcher can definitely create agent-based models with\nemergence that is not baked in. That said, many people doing agent-based\nmodels for humans have fallen into the trap of making extremely complex\nagent-based models that especially have many cognitive features. It is then\nvery difficult at the end to tell what is causing what. Thus, apparent emergence\nmight be reported, but it was actually baked in as cognitive mechanisms, but\nthe modeler did not realize that initially primarily because the model was just\ntoo complex to understand.\nRaffaele Vardavas: Importance of Nonlinearity for Emergence\nIn my view emergence is not just a surprise factor. Emergence occurs when the\nnew environments resulting from the complex interplay of different entities in\nthe system cannot be understood by understanding each entity or groups\nof entities in isolation. Hence, emergence occurs only in nonlinear systems\nthat include complex feedback loops where new environments cannot be\nunderstood by simply summing over each agent\u2019s behavior when considered\nin isolation. Emergence occurs when entities self-organize and adapt to new\nenvironments that they, in part, helped to form.\nBill Rand: The Difficulty in Simulating Emergence\nMany definitions of emergence contain some notion of surprise, i.e. that\nemergence is a phenomenon at the macro level that one would not expect from\nthe micro-level rules. That cannot be a good definition, since it means that if\nscientists and researchers observe the same emergent phenomenon over and\nover again and are therefore no longer surprised, then emergence no longer\noccurs. A better definition of emergence would be a definition that somehow\nstates that the emergent phenomenon is not defined by the micro-level entities,\nbut instead is a product of the interaction of multiple entities. However, such a\ndefinition might be overbroad by counting any macro-state of the system, such\nas an average, as an emergent phenomenon. That may or may not be acceptable.\nIf we accept this second definition of emergence, then \u2013 of course \u2013\nemergence is baked into every simulation. That does not make the results\nany less valuable, showing that one set of micro-conditions creates a partic-\nular pattern of emergence and another does not can be extremely valuable.\nMoreover, though it is often the case in simple models that the macro-levelDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

As a quick explanation, we have done work on\nsimulating social media behavior from individual-level rules (Darmon et al.\n2013; Harada et al. 2014). When we tried to use these models of individual-level\nbehavior to recreate macro-level, emergent patterns of social media behavior,\nwe failed in our first attempts (Ariyaratne 2016). Even though individual-level\nrules worked very well, they failed to take into account phenomena outside\nthe system that became much more important at the macro level, such as\ntime of day. These outside patterns, seasonality in this case, are important for\nsynchronizing the micro-level rules, and hence not including them prevents\nemergent patterns. To create emergent patterns of behavior, it is important to\nget all the components and their interactions correct, and thus in some ways\nsimulations can be used as tests of minimal and sufficient conditions that are\nnecessary to generate emergent phenomenon.\nPaul K. Davis: Reproducing Emergence Through Simulation Is a\nValuable Hard Problem to Tackle\nMy original discipline was theoretical chemistry and physics, so I have always\nseen emergence as analogous to the phase transitions of those subjects (e.g.\nprecipitation in a liquid or the advent of superfluidity). Anyone observing those\nfor the first time will see them as magical. All examples of emergence that come\nto my mind should, I believe, be reproducible in simulation. Doing so might\nrequire sophisticated agents, and variable-structure, self-aware simulation. In\nthis context, the latter means to me not only the capability of identifying which\nof some a priori structures applies at a given point but also the capability to\nrecognize new objects or patterns in itself, giving them names, and proceeding\nwith them as part of structure. Building such a simulation would be no mean\nfeat, but it seems to be a hard problem, not something impossible. There may\nalso be types of emergence that cannot even in principle be generated from\nsimulation. Examples sometimes given, all of which are in dispute, include the\nsoul, consciousness, and such spooky aspects of quantum mechanics as action\nat a distance.\nScott Neal Reilly: Simulations Can Explore How Emergent Behavior\nMight Occur\nInstead of tackling this question head on, let me offer a slightly different\nperspective. While surprising emergence in simulations might be possible\nand useful, it isn\u2019t typically how I think about these sorts of issues. Instead of\ncreating low-level simulations and seeing what might unexpectedly emerge, I\ntypically start with the higher-level (emergent) phenomenon and try to come\nup with a lower-level explanation/simulation from which that phenomenonDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nSimulation and Emergence 763\nmight emerge. That is, I more or less try to bake the phenomenon in. Not in the\nsense that it is explicitly coded in its high-level form, but in the sense that I want\nit to emerge from the low-level model. If it doesn\u2019t emerge, or doesn\u2019t emerge\nin a way that matches reality, that suggests that the underlying explanation\nisn\u2019t correct. Or if it is close to correct, it lets me explore the space of trade-offs\nand configurations that are consistent with the phenomenon. This does not\ntell me when a low-level model is correct, but it does let me explore the space\nof possibly correct models. In some of my earlier work, I was exploring models\nof human emotion and how they arise from other mental processes. This led\nme to better understand how the human motivation system must work such\nthat emotions arise as they do. My models rarely surprised me by producing\nthings that I didn\u2019t expect, but often surprised me by producing things that I\ndidn\u2019t want as they were clearly inconsistent with human emotions, which led\nme to explore alternate hypotheses (Neal Reilly 1996).\nTed Pavlic: Simulations Can Serve as Existential Witnesses\nfor Emergent Phenomena\nWhat does it mean to say that emergence might be baked in to a simulation? As\nnicely summarized in a complexity primer (Prokopenko et al. 2009), emergence\nis a property of a large (but not too large) group of agents participating in an\nopen system with nontrivial interactions that result in internal constraints that\nlead to coordinated global behavior that is self-organized in patterns detectable\nto an outside observer. We call these patterns emergent. If the patterns are\nsomehow encoded into the agents, then the phenomenon does not fit all of the\ncriteria. For example, if an agent receives information about the state of all other\nagents and uses that information to place itself so that the group achieves some\nglobal task, then the system is not self-organized and thus cannot be emergent.\nThis precise definition is in contrast to the fuzziness of whatever is meant by\nbaked-in.\nBetter criticisms of claims about emergence from simulation should focus\non: (i) the realism of conditions for self-organization and (ii) whether the\nemergent patterns are meaningful and adaptive. A simulation can be used\nas an existential witness for emergent phenomena, but the demonstration\nthat such phenomena are possible does not mean that they are probable. A\nspectacular coordinated pattern that emerges from nontrivial interactions\nof simulated fish may be extremely fragile to parameter choices or subtle\nnuances such as the requirement that all fish behave using identical behavioral\nprograms. Although this is a true example of emergence, the conditions may\nbe contrived and absent in nature. Even if the emergent patterns are robust\nto parameter changes and heterogeneity, the emergence may or may not be\nmeaningful. The convex hull that surrounds a flock of starlings appears to\nitself be a macroscopic, amoeboid macrostructure with its own novel patternsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Again, such emergent\npatterns can be reproduced in a simulation, but in this case the emergence is\na mere epiphenomenon of the selfish interactions of birds that are individually\nminimizing their risk of predation. There is no cost nor benefit of the emergent\namoeba. The amoeba is not truly adapting to circumstances.\nBy contrast if the emergent phenomenon in question appears to be adaptive\n(as with a CAS), then both sources of criticism vanish. The adaptiveness of an\nemergent structure that would otherwise require highly contrived parameter\nchoices may increase the possibility of those parameter choices occurring\nnaturally. For example, in the social cycle of the slime mold Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum, the spontaneous emission and reemission of cyclic AMP leads to\nspiral waves whose centers attract nearby cells as aggregation sites (Devreoles\net al. 1983). These highly stylized patterns can be regenerated with high\nfidelity in simulation of the hypothesized underlying mechanism and the\nsurrounding physical medium (H\u00f6fer et al. 1995). When the cells of these\nsocial aggregations come together, they form motile slugs that eventually\ndevelop into stalks supporting fruiting bodies that effectively disperse spores\nto remote areas of the habitat.\nWhether a natural-system phenomenon is adaptive depends, from a behav-\nioral ecologist\u2019s point of view, on its survival value (Tinbergben 1963) after\nconsidering both benefits and costs. A very beneficial macroscopic structure\nmight be selected even if only a narrow set of parameters enables it. An oth-\nerwise likely emergent phenomenon may not occur if accompanied by great\ncosts. If the amoeboid envelopes surrounding starlings made them markedly\nmore conspicuous to predators, we would not expect such emergent patterns\nto persist. Of course, the behavioral ecologist is also concerned with the\ndevelopmental and evolutionary constraints. Certain emergent phenomena\nmay be unavoidable side effects, whereas other emergent phenomena might\nbe impossible. Consequently, in both natural group phenomena as well as\nnovel group phenomena that emerges out of complex human socio-technical\ninteractions, there may always be latent, emergent endogeneous risks that are\nimpossible to purge from the space of possible outcomes. For example, essen-\ntially blind army ants that conduct massive foraging raids navigating only with\nolfactory bread-crumb-like chemicals deposited on their path will occasionally\nbecome stuck in a self-reinforcing circular mill of ants, disconnected from their\nhome nest. They will churn until exhaustion and eventual death (Schneitle\n1944). This self-organized pattern is emergent, costly, but always a possibility\ndue to the constraints of how these nearly blind ants navigate. This kind of\nendogenous risk shares many of the features of a stock market run \u2013 where\nindividuals driven by a rise or fall in price make concomitant purchasing or\nselling decisions that further reinforce the change in price. Long stock market\nruns are rare, as are circular mills of army ants. However, they are both easy to\nstudy in simulation.

Simulation then gains its value not\nthrough its ability to reproduce reality in high fidelity, but by allowing discovery\nof scenarios that are important but too rare to anticipate from data alone.\nUltimately, simulations of emergent phenomena should only be employed\nas part of a scientific process. They should either be testing a hypothesis on\nthe mechanisms underlying some already observed emergent phenomena or\nfor generating new plausible hypotheses that may lead to further real-world\nexperimentation.\nRelating Models Across Levels\nQuestion: Consensus exists on the need for social-behavioral models describing\nphenomena at different levels of detail.

However, challenges exist both to our ability to build\nsuch models and to understand how to use them. Three pervasive challenges\nemerged from the discussions.\n1. There is an insufficient scientific foundation to draw on for understanding\nhow different levels relate to each other (Kathleen M. Carley).\n2.

Predicting the\noutcome of such a situation requires understanding not simply the physical\ncharacteristics of the circumstance (i.e. a person grasping an axe) but also the\nmeanings that are layered over top of it, giving rise to a combination known as\nthe definition of the situation. This is key to predicting behavior. For example,\ncontrast the statements \u201cA woman slaps a child.\u201d with \u201cA mother spanks a\nbrat;\u201d for many observers the former event seems to be assault of an innocent,\nwhile the latter is harsh discipline for misbehavior. But in both cases a female\nactor (woman/mother) is enacting physical violence (slap/spank) on a weak\ntarget (child/brat). Therefore what is different, and relevant for predicting the\nactions and reactions of others, are the meanings attached to events rather\nthan the events themselves.\nGiven these challenges, Weber argued for his Verstehen method, in which\nexplanations must be sufficient on the level of meaning. Less cryptically, toDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This is\ndifficult because humans are deft symbol manipulators, as revealed by Rene\nMagritte\u2019s famous painting of a pipe with the caption, \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas une pipe\u201d\n(\u201cThis is not a pipe\u201d). The painting initially provokes consternation because the\nobserver notes that it is a pipe only to realize upon reflection that in fact it is\nonly a painting of a pipe and not a pipe itself. We so readily accept the symbol\nas what it signifies that being forced to recognize this mental sleight of hand is\nfrustrating \u2013 but also enlightening. To predict behavior we need our models to\nbe able to capture not simply the painting, but the pipe as well.\nIt may seem impossible to account for the meanings individuals attach to\nevents as this appears to require knowing the contents of every mind, but\nappearances can be deceiving. Meanings are often not individual but rather are\nsocially defined. For example, the large body of work on affect control theory\n(ACT) shows that the affective (emotional) reactions of individuals to events\ncan be mathematically described and accurately predicted (see www.indiana\n.edu/~socpsy/ACT). Indeed, this theory provides tools for quantitatively\nmodeling the events described above between a woman and a child, generating\npredictions of the emotional reactions of onlookers. Likewise, Ann Swidler\nnotes that culture operates as a toolkit, providing sets of symbols, routines,\nand meanings that are shared by members of a society (Swidler 1986). These\ndon\u2019t just passively lie over top of a situation but are deployed by individuals to\nachieve desired objectives. For example, to show affection on Valentine\u2019s Day,\na man might select flowers, chocolate, or jewelry for a female partner rather\nthan a gift card to a retailer; these gestures connoting affection are broadly\nunderstood and can be deployed actively to influence the ideas and behaviors\nof others. In short, meanings are not idiosyncratic but are highly patterned\nand predictable.\nIn short, modeling across levels and with more detail than the broadest pos-\nsible overview requires attending to the meanings that human actors attach\nto circumstances, use to define situations, and ultimately deploy to achieve\ntheir ends. These meanings are shared, which is what lends them their power\nand therefore are measureable and often predictable. With serious effort, it\nshould be possible within 10 years to make considerable progress in adapting\nwell-established research programs, such as ACT, to computational models, as\nwell as linking these affective reactions to behaviors. In that same period, it\nshould be possible to substantially improve our ability to measure, categorize,\nand model cultural tools. However, if researchers simply discard meanings as\nunimportant, perhaps viewing them as too soft or hazy to deserve attention,\nthen their models will forever be insufficient, focusing only on the painting,\nwhile humans respond to the pipe.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A multi-scale analysis allows tracing causal rela-\ntionships between levels (Mayntz 2004; Kittel 2006). This has been termed the\nColeman bathtub model of social explanation (Coleman 1990). Salthe (1991)\ncontends that three contiguous levels are sufficient to represent any real system.\nThis question reflects the micro-to-macro problem, the capacity for theory to\nexplain the relationship between the constitutive elements of social systems\n(individual, micro-level cognitive agents) and the emergent phenomena that\nresult from their interaction on larger scales, such as organizations (at the meso\nlevel), and widespread information diffusion (at the macro level). This problem\nhas led to models that concentrate, and thus may restrict, scientific study by\nscoping investigations to emphasize cognitive, social, or sociological perspec-\ntives. To bridge the divide, theoretically grounded models of human cognition\nshould be paired with those that account for the influence of interpersonal\ninteractions, as well as representations of how these individual and group inter-\nactions emerge to form phenomena reflected at the society level (Briscoe et al.\n2011).\nThe fact that many behavioral models operate on only a single scale should\nnot preclude efforts toward understanding how multi-scale interactions may\nbe represented in a more comprehensive or whole system modeling approach.\nThe field of systems science has grown out of the belief that some systems can-\nnot be studied at only lower levels. Within this field, open systems, i.e. those\nwhich interact with their environment, must be represented with a multi-scale\napproach or scale-holistic approach (Klir 1991). What makes a whole system\ndepends, of course, on where system boundaries are drawn, but as Goguen and\nFarela point out, two important properties of capturing a system\u2019s wholeness\nis that emergent, or systems properties, are able to appear and that the level of\nchosen complexity precludes the system from any further reduction (Goguen\nand Farela 1979). This emergence may be a critical component in explaining\nblack swan events (Taleb 2007), which occur so rarely as to make it difficult to\nincorporate them into mathematical models with any precision.\nMulti-scale interactions have been traditionally perceived as flowing upward,\nfrom micro to macro, where the macro-scale effects are directly created from\nindividual actions. Hedstr\u00f6m and Swedberg (1998) refer to this interaction\nas transformational, where individuals\u2019 interactions are transformed into a\ncollective outcome. This interaction is readily identified when macro-scale\nphenomena appear as emergent effects of interdependent agents; however,\nindividual action implicitly eliminates structural features from the relationship\ndirectly responsible for a macro-scale phenomenon. For example, in theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Depicting such matters as a multi-scale\nproblem begs for the use of both data-driven (e.g. the characterization of\nsocial networks based on social media) and theory-driven approaches (e.g. the\napplication of the technology acceptance model).\nScott Neal Reilly: A Combination of Theory-Driven and Data-Driven\nInquiry Is Best\nI think there are two separate issues at play here, or at least two different\nways of using terminology that I think are important to keep clear. The first\nissue is about top-down vs. bottom-up. We often tend to use these terms to\nrelate this to theory-driven (top-down) vs. data-driven (bottom-up) modeling.\nIn my work with colleagues, however, we often start with theories and then\nlook for data to back them up and refine them. Also, when sufficient data\nis available, we can use data mining and machine learning to help suggest\nadditional hypotheses for a human social scientist to vet and further explore\nas appropriate. We have proposed that neither is the right way and that a\nhybrid approach that leverages both theory and data is best. I don\u2019t see any\nsignificant conceptual or methodological impediments to doing this as I see it\ndone all the time. There are plenty of cases where it is done poorly (e.g. sticking\nwith theories that don\u2019t fit the data, or using data-driven models that overfit\nthe data and don\u2019t work in practice), but those are more issues of practice.\nThe second issue relates integrating models that work at different levels of\ndetail. For instance, how do you integrate agent-based models of individuals\nand system dynamics models of society-level phenomena? These models can\nbe built using top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid approaches in the senses just\ndescribed, so this is largely an orthogonal issue to the first one. And this is\nwhere there are more conceptual and methodological challenges. I tend to cre-\nate single-level models that are customized to the task at hand and so sidestep\nthis problem. Other authors are better able to speak to the multilevel challenges\nand opportunities.\nCorey Lofdahl: Decomposition Is Sometimes Necessary But Creates\nIssues\nWhen creating, or attempting to create, multi-resolution models, I usually find\nmyself moving from more aggregate, high-level models to lower-level, decom-\nposed models because aggregation is a simplifying assumption that is built into\nthe system dynamics (SD) simulation methodology (Lofdahl 2010).

That is, the value or level of a\nstock is determined by the difference of the stock inputs and outputs. This is\na significant simplification because stocks are treated as perfectly connected,\nhomogeneous networks, while reality is imperfectly connected and heteroge-\nneous (Rahmandad and Sterman 2008). Decomposition is the process of mov-\ning from an abstract and holistic representation to a detailed and fractionated\none. There are three primary difficulties associated with this decomposition\nprocess \u2013 component (i) initialization, (ii) connection, and (iii) evolution.\nDecomposing an aggregate geography and analyzing its components pro-\nvides an example. First, when an aggregate geography, for example, Baghdad, is\ndecomposed into its nine constituent districts, it creates an initialization issue\nbecause each new component needs to be initialized separately. For example,\nif the population of aggregate Baghdad is almost 8 million people, then what is\nits population by district? One may be tempted to average the total population\nand use that each district, but this provides no additional analytic insight\nand is almost certainly incorrect. Aggregate measures can therefore only\nbe decomposed to the resolution at which data can be collected effectively.\nSecond, when regions are decomposed, their spatial relationships can be\nrepresented as in a contiguity matrix in which a 1 represents a connection\nthrough a shared border and 0 represents spatial disconnection. This then\nallows for the representation of real-world, spatial diffusion behaviors such as\ncross-border flows of people, money, and goods (Anselin 2013). Third, these\nspatial relationships and their associated behaviors vary over time or evolve.\nFor example, as the population of Baghdad grows, new districts are created,\nor if the population shrinks, districts may unify or coalesce, which requires\na change in the representation of spatial relationships. Representing these\ncomplex dynamic processes easily and flexibly in multi-resolution frameworks\nremains an ongoing research and development opportunity.\nTed Pavlic: Detailed Models Are Only Sometimes Desirable\nModels exist on a spectrum from analogous to metaphorical with the value\nof a model depending not on how detailed it is but on how insightful it is to\na particular research question. Progress will never be made if social scientists\nfail to adopt modeling because the models are not sufficiently detailed. More\ndetailed models also yield less transferrable and generalizable insight. A highly\ndetailed model should only be used when considering, e.g. \u201chard operations\nresearch problems\u201d of operating a very specific system for a very specific length\nof time. Insight into general patterns across societies can only be found with less\ndetailed models capturing the salient features across those societies.

If the hypothesis is specific (e.g. its scope is\nthe city of Santa Clara, CA), then detail is needed. If the hypothesis is general,\ne.g. it is to explain a phenomenon observed in Santa Clara, Des Moines, and\nelsewhere, then such detail would be inappropriate and likely incorrect. Every\ndetail added to a model is another assumption. Models should be parsimonious\non their assumptions or else risk providing insights that are fragile. In the next\n10 years, sociologists should focus less on improving model fidelity and more\non better understanding the proper way to use models within a scientific pro-\ncess. Computational models of complex, nonhuman natural systems have been\nvery successful in guiding the search for knowledge and it was not necessary\nfor many of them to be highly accurate despite the complex behavioral reper-\ntoires of the animals being simulated. Similarly, it would be exceptional (and\nsuspicious) to believe that a simulation of the entire population of the United\nStates must involve agents with accurate representations of emotional states to\nbe useful. If there is any danger to baking in emergent results, it comes from\nadding more detail into models, not less.\nWilliam B. Rouse: Top-Down or Bottom-Up Modeling Serve Different\nPurposes\nDepending on the question of interest, phenomena can be addressed different\nways. When we study the impacts of interventions on patients with diabetes,\nheart disease, or Alzheimer\u2019s, we are interested in the impact of patient char-\nacteristics. Hence, a bottom-up agent-based model makes sense. A top-down\nsystems dynamics model would aggregate away individual differences that we\nhypothesize are important.\nOn the other hand, the costs of these interventions are highly affected by\neconomic inflation. An agent-based approach to predicting inflation would be\noverwhelming and, at best, marginally useful. A system dynamics economic\nmodel would be a good approach in this case.\nIf we are interested in flows of patients through capacities that provide the\ninterventions of interest, then discrete-event models could predict waiting\ntimes, queue lengths, etc. Such a model would be intermediate between\nbottom-up agents and top-down economies.\nA key issue is how these three models play together. Higher-level models tend\nto operate on longer time scales. For example, climate change models address\ndecades or centuries, while models of consumer choices, which may affect cli-\nmate, focus on days or weeks.\nA related issue is entangled states where the solutions of two models interact,\npotentially requiring simultaneous solutions. This can sometimes be avoided\nusing principled heuristics that enable separability of solutions. Devising such\nheuristics can be as much an art as a science.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Davis: Aggregation and Disaggregation Functions Need To Be\nContextual\nIn my mind\u2019s eye, the natural way to view agent-based modeling (ABM) is\nby analogy to a laboratory in which one conducts microscopic experiments\nwith the intention of discovering or understanding and characterizing rela-\ntively more macroscopic regularities, which can then inform corresponding\nmacroscopic theories and related models. Within theoretical physics and\nchemistry, analogs would be in studying molecular dynamics (either with\npure theory or simulation) to better understand equilibrium and some forms\nof nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Part of the analogy would be to use\nmacroscopic knowledge to inform the design of computational experiments:\nthat is, we already know that interesting macroscopic phenomena exist (social\nmovements and narratives among them). This should help tell us what to look\nfor. Has the ABM community been too enthusiastic about the false idol of\nunderstanding phenomena as being generated from agents with simple rules\n(as in the original Boids)? In practice, real-world humans act not only based\non their goals and individual characteristics but also because of myriad effects\nof the environment manifested as constraints and also stimuli causing the\nhumans to change their values and behavior.\nAs a different matter, I observe that while many authors exhort understanding\nlinkages among models at different levels of detail, not much attention seems\nto be paid to the mathematical theory required in doing so. As described else-\nwhere (Davis 2019), the correctness of an aggregation depends on how it will\nbe used and in what context (sometimes, the right aggregation is an average;\nsometimes, it is the maximum value). This is unfortunate because it implies\na great deal of complication. However, it is something that humans do every\nday: we work with abstractions intended to be roughly right for what we are\ndoing. If the afternoon is different from the morning, we change our abstrac-\ntions accordingly, without missing a beat. Conceptualizing the analog to this in\nsocial-behavioral modeling in, to me, another hard but feasible problem.\nRaffaele Vardavas: Bottom-Up Modeling Need Not Be All or Nothing\nSimple nonlinear sets of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can show\ncomplex dynamics and even chaos. Thus, equation-based models (EBMs)\ncan provide a lot of insight into the dynamics of these systems. However,\nthey cannot easily include heterogeneities, network effects and more complex\nbehavioral rules of adaptation. Hence, the need for microsimulation and\nagent-based models. However, these models can easily become highly com-\nplicated with many detailed mechanisms and the need to provide parameter\nestimates for each. This then requires an increased number of ensemble case\nruns to average over and more and harder data to analyze. Thus, wheneverDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For example, if\nwe have an ABM that models firm behavior and competition, we might want\nto model the population of citizens who are serviced by the firms, or can invest\nin them, using EBMs. Hence, my preference is a bottom-up approach where\nthe entities of interest are modeled using agents, but it is not necessary to\nmodel all entities in the system this way.\nAs an additional comment, although ABMs can include many of the agents\u2019\nheterogeneities to be representative of the starting conditions of a real system,\nI find that the most revealing ABMs show how these heterogeneities emerge\nspontaneously from the model dynamics starting from a homogeneous set of\nagents.\nKent Myers: Meso-Modeling Is a Good Fit for Addressing Concrete\nHuman Problems\nA meso-model is intended to reveal connections between micro and macro\nlevels. Typically, detail is reduced at the extremes. This is not everyone\u2019s\nfavorite; scholars will tend to see it as compromised for one reason or another.\nBut there are advantages to working with meso-models:\n\u2022 It is possible to represent significant relationships without laboring over\nmodeling details or big data.\n\u2022 In particular scenarios, causes and effects will tend to make sense and be\ntraceable.\n\u2022 The meso-model level covers the same territory as actor mental models. It\nis the level at which actors in the system typically account for their strategic\ninterventions. If researchers learn something at that level, decision-makers\nare likely to pay attention and may change their thinking.\n\u2022 It is possible to add to such a model selectively as events and testing\nwarrants.\nI\u2019m not arguing against those who aspire for more richness. I\u2019m only arguing\nfor the benefits of getting things roughly right for systems that are inherently\nhard to nail down and that are changing as we speak, and for which we (or\npolicy-makers) need understandable guidance now. This is similar to the argu-\nments in favor of grounded theory: formulate what is going on in a situation of\ninterest to gain insight that is ready for use in that situation.\nWe can also use newer framing concepts. For example, Uhl-Bien and Marion\ndescribe a meso approach where the micro level is leader decision-making and\nthe macro level is a complex adaptive organization. They point out that many\norganizational researchers seek to explain what goes on in an organization by\nfavoring one of these levels over another, but they argue in favor of research\nthat employs both simultaneously:Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It is this recognition that leads us to propose a\nmodel of adaptive functioning based on interdependent (and meso) rela-\ntionships between agentic actions and emergent forces.\n(Uhl-Bien and Marion 2009, p. 637)\nIn other words, the admonition is to put the attention on the interaction\nbetween the CAS and the agents who are able to intervene. The agents can be\nmodeled as biased or as nonrational as one sees fit, and their actions will be fil-\ntered through a CAS that won\u2019t have linear, predictable responses. Perhaps that\napproach just doubles the confusion, but it is a realistic approach and keeps the\nfocus on what can be done to make the whole system succeed, fail, or evolve.\nMeso-modeling is a promising direction to take over the next 10 years,\nbut not as a stepping stone toward something else, especially not toward the\ndiscredited, old-fashioned dreams of complete and accurate representation\nsupporting perfect control. The more sober aim will be to get it roughly right\nfor useful insight. That is, we should use newly available data, surely, but not\nstop there. The systems we are interested in involve humans and can\u2019t help but\nbe constituted in various ways by what people are thinking. To get at this data,\nwe need to talk to people and develop expertise in interpreting what they are\nsaying and doing. The findings we develop in this way may even be left out\nof explicit models, but they can\u2019t be left out of the inquiry as a whole. Such\nthoughts may appear to be sending us backward, toward armchair theorizing,\nbut in fact it is getting us past a major methodological impediment, the\nassumption that both the inquirer and the actors can be scrubbed out of the\npicture with reductive controls and that somehow that is more scientific. Arid\nmodeling will surely remain a competitor in the academy, but no one should\nbe surprised if the practical results are meager.\nLevent Yilmaz: Improved Development of Hybrid Models Is Possible\nDesigning hybrid models is indeed a challenge. The Winter Simulation Con-\nference has recently established a track to foster new developments in this\narea. I wrote on this topic in the early 2000s and suggested the development\nof simulation model programming features that improve our ability to blend\ntogether alternative paradigms in a coherent manner. In the programming lan-\nguage domain, for instance, we observe the emergence of new languages that\nbring together the object-oriented/imperative and the functional paradigm\nunder a single framework (e.g. Scala, F#).

Carley: Distinguishing Challenges of Multilevel\nand Hybrid Simulation\nI believe that the panel question is an ill-formed question as it is conflates two\nthings \u2013 multilevel modeling and hybrid models. These have different advan-\ntages and different constraints to their development.\nMultilevel simulations: In a multilevel simulation, there is a dimension along\nwhich an activity at different levels of granularity on that dimension\nfollows different logics and where behavior at one level of granularity\nmay constrain or enable behavior at another. An example is the agent\ndimension where neuron-level agents, human-level agents, group-level\nagents, corporate-level agents, and country-level agents each follow their\nown logic for how they come into being, how they die or end, how they\ninteract, grow, and so forth. Multilevel simulations are difficult to develop\nbecause (i) there may be insufficient theoretical understanding of how the\ndifferent levels of granularity operate or constrain/enable each other; (ii)\nthere may be insufficient and/or inconsistent data for informing, setting\ninitial values, and validating such models, and hence much of the effort\nmay go into data fusion exercises rather than simulation; (iii) the models\nthemselves are more complex and take longer to develop due to the number\nof variables; (iv) meaningful virtual experiments that lead to results that are\ninteresting at each level of granularity are difficult to construct; (v) existing\nsimulation engines are not designed to easily facilitate multilevel modeling\n(while they can be used, there is no built-in support for multilevel activities)\nand hence the simulationist spends extra time developing the multilevel\ninfrastructure instead of developing the model per se; and (vi) multilevel\nmodels are substantially more complex to explain to those wanting to\nunderstand how the model works, thus reducing trust in such models.\nThat being said, there are a number of multilevel models that have been\ndeveloped and used (Lanham et al. 2014; Carley et al. 2017). It is generally\nthought that taking a multi-modeling approach and linking together a set\nof independent models into an interoperable suite, or a system of systems,\nis a promising approach. Unfortunately, existing infrastructures for linking\nmultiple models were developed for models of engineered systems and so do\nnot have the ability to operate simultaneously at diverse levels of granularity\nfor time, space/distance, agent/group size, and specificity or/confidence of\nresults. A better infrastructure would enable more progress.

The co-usage of\ntwo or more modeling frameworks is what characterizes a hybrid model\n(referred to as multi-formalism modeling in Gribaudo et al. 2019). Some\nhybrid models are used in multilevel modeling. The key challenges to doing\nhybrid modeling include: (i) most simulationists are trained in a single type\nof modeling and lack the experience to develop a hybrid model; (ii) hybrid\nmodeling often requires team efforts and correspondingly higher develop-\nment and coordination costs; (iii) hybrid models have higher data demands\n(often in different formats and granularities); (iv) technical infrastructure\ntools that support linking models from different simulation frameworks\ndon\u2019t exist; and last, but not the least, (v) it is often unclear theoretically and\nempirically under what conditions the hybrid models can be interoperable\nwithout violating their scope conditions or making egregious assumptions\nabout how processes link together.\nGoing Beyond Rational Actors\nQuestion: It is widely agreed that some agents in social-behavioral model-\ning need to incorporate much more human-like characteristics in their\ncognition and behavior, a point made convincingly by Robert Axtell (see\nTable 33.1) and, in a different stream, Joshua M.

Carley notes, needing to go beyond rational actor assumptions\nis old news. In particular, contributors highlighted a few promising approaches\nfor developing more realistic agents.\nMachine learning: Joshua M. Epstein urges the approach of Inverse Genera-\ntive Social Science, which draws on machine learning to generate agent rules\nrather than parameters.\nDynamic network models: Kathleen M. Carley and Raffaele Vardavas discuss\nhow social network models move beyond rationalist assumptions and more\nclosely approximate humans\u2019 decision-making processes. Developing more\ncomputationally tractable dynamic network models will provide more lever-\nage modeling emergent phenomena.\nQuantum cognition models: Levent Yilmaz emphasizes the need to take cog-\nnitive biases and limitations into account as we move toward greater agent\nrealism. Quantum cognition models address the order effects and conjunc-\ntion fallacies observed in actual human behavior.\nDecision field theory ( DFT) models: Ted Pavlic cautions against the dan-\ngers of embedding overly realistic decision rules in agents and proposes\nbuilding in mechanisms from cognitive psychology meant to characterize\ndecision-making accuracy and latency rather than more complicated\nagent-specific decision-making processes.\nMoving beyond the technological processes of building more adaptive agents,\ncontributors emphasize the importance of answering the following questions\nwhen developing agent-based models.\nHow realistic do agents need to be? Increases in the realism of agents entails\ncosts in terms of data needs, computational requirements, comprehensi-\nbility, and the feasibility of validation, as well as other concerns. As Ted\nPavlic notes, we gain little when our models become \u201cas inscrutable as the\nsystem we are trying to describe.\u201d Scott Neal Reilly argues that a model\u2019s\ndetail should be that needed to gain robust analytical insights. Greater detail\ncan make it difficult to interpret models, reduce robustness of results, and\nincrease computational burden.\nWhat are the learning and deliberation processes for agents? As agents become\nmore realistic, the information sources and learning processes of agents\nbecome more important. Vardavas and Carley highlight the need to link\ninternal agent processes to their social networks. Pavlic cautions that more\nrealistically delineating the decision rules of agents risks baking in emergent\nphenomena.\nHow will agents behave in diverse environments? Models with more realistic\nagents can run the risk of being overfit to a specific context. This may be\na particularly acute concern when using evidence-based approaches such\nas statistical analyses of past behavior or machine learning approaches toDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Such approaches can lock in past behaviors\nand may miss emergent behavior (Vardavas, Carley).\nAn overarching conclusion from this discussion is that realism for realism\u2019s\nsake is not a good modeling objective. While more realistic agents may be nec-\nessary to understand some contexts, building realistic agents entails trade-offs\nand may result in models that are less useful for their purpose.\nJoshua M. Epstein: Inverse Generative Social Science \u2013 What Machine\nLearning Can Do for Agent-Based Modeling\nWhile I certainly endorse the broad agenda referred to in the panel question,\nI am particularly excited by what I call Inverse Generative Social Science and\nby how machine learning (ML) can advance it. As background, artificial intelli-\ngence and ML are displacing humans, but not explaining them. Machines can\ncrush humans at chess, but do not illuminate how humans play chess. When\nasked how he came up with a winning brilliancy against IBM\u2019s Deep Blue, Gary\nKasparov answered simply, \u201cIt smelled right.\u201d\nWhile it has not been used in this way, machine learning can help explain\nhuman behavior, even moving ABM into a new epoch. So far, agents have been\niterated forward to generate such explananda as settlement patterns, scaling\nlaws, epidemic dynamics,\u2026, all sorts of things. But these are all examples of\nthe forward problem: we design agents and grow the target phenomenon. The\nmotto of generative social science is: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t grow it, you didn\u2019t explain\nit.\u201d But there may be many ways to grow it! How do we find all the nontrivial\ngenerators?\nThis is Inverse Generative Social Science \u2013 agents as model outputs, not\nmodel inputs \u2013 and ML can enable it. Compactly, let M be some macro-\nphenomenon we want to explain. Let m be a candidate micro-world (het-\nerogeneous agents, their rules, numerical parameters, environment, initial\nconditions, etc.). When iterated forward, every micro-m generates some\nmacro-thing, call it G(m). The explanatory fitness of m is the (metric-\ndependent) proximity of G(m) to M. So, given an explanatory target M (wealth\ndistribution, spatial settlement pattern, conflict dynamic, financial panic,\nor difficult conjunctions of these), use machine learning to (i) construct the\nlarge search space of admissible heterogeneous agent micro-worlds (m\u2019s), (ii)\nencode this space in a searchable way, and (iii) evolve (for instance) the fittest\nexplanatory candidates (e.g. mutation and crossover on agent rules, not just\nparameters) under various metrics.\nI proposed this earlier (Epstein 1999, 2006), but the components \u2013 neurocog-\nnitive, computational, and data analytic \u2013 were immature then. Independently,\nthese have arrived and the time is ripe to synthesize them and attack inverse\ngenerative problems of social science and history.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Relatedly, though they don\u2019t\ncall it this, the Inverse Anasazi modeling of Gunaratne and Garibay (2018)\nuses evolutionary programming to construct new micro-rules that (slightly)\noutperform those reported in Axtell et al., though they confirm the overall\nconclusions. This method thus allows for a kind of structural (not merely\nparametric) sensitivity analysis that will be important in formalizing the\nrobustness of rule-based systems as this promising agenda unfolds.\nRaffaele Vardavas: Evidence-Based Models Need to be General\nEnough to be Realistic Under Alternative Specifications\nThe way I think about CASs for socioeconomic systems is that individual agents\nneed three components affecting their behavior: (i) their adaptation to personal\ndecisions and experiences, (ii) social network effects reflecting the influence of\nsocial contacts, and (iii) the effect of media and social media.\nI agree that we want to move away from rational expectations and simplistic\nutility maximization where agents are thought to make decisions relying com-\npletely on deductive thought. Instead, we need to use more realistic models\nthat include inductive thought and social network influences in the decision\nprocess.\nModels should pass the Lucas critique whereby internal casual mechanisms\nand behavioral rules should be fundamental and general enough to allow the\nmodel to make sensible and realistic predictions under very different alternative\nenvironments and policies. This may indeed mean moving away from inform-\ning the model entirely using regression models of data when the system was in\na given state or at the status quo. Such regressions may not hold true when the\nsystem is run far from the status quo conditions. Regression models provide a\ndescriptive account of agents\u2019 behaviors. In my opinion, they should be used\nto help formulate the mechanistic behavioral and causal rules. For example, a\nregression model may suggest that a person\u2019s decision to vaccinate for the flu\ndoes not strongly depend on whether he or she caught the flu last year or in past\nyears, but does depends strongly on whether he or she vaccinated in the past\nyear or years. Does that suggest that we should put this directly in our ABM?\nSuppose that we consider a what-if scenario or world with no more seasonal\nflu. In this scenario, the majority of agents in the model may still be vaccinating\nfor many years after flu was eradicated. This seems to be implausible. Hence, we\nneed to be careful in our effort of having our models highly tied to the data and\nevidence based using these types of descriptive approaches. The fact that the\nmodel can be validated to reproduce the status quo conditions does not neces-\nsarily mean that it is valid under policies or conditions that are very different\nfrom the status quo.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Carley: Agent-Based Dynamic Network Models Produce\nMore Realistic Agents\nThis (needing to go beyond rational actors) is old news. For the last 20 years,\nthere have been social science models that are not rational actor models. The\nonly people still building rational actor models are physicists, engineers, and\neconomists. None of the leading computational social scientists do this.\nMany modern agent-based models are agent-based dynamic network mod-\nels. Network-based models were proposed prior to World War II as an alter-\nnative to the rational man model. When agent-based models are predicated on\nevolving social and knowledge networks, they generate behavior that is more\nrealistic. Also, the best agent models at the cognitive level, e.g. Soar and ACT-r,\nare also not rational actor models. A key challenge is how to scale these models\nand place them in a social/knowledge network context.\nModern machine learning models, which require training sets, are the new\nvariant of rational actor models. They are predicated on the assumption that\ntomorrow is like today, that the training set is comprehensive vis the problem\nspace, and that the actor (in this case the ML model) can know and process\nall information. However, in many cases social-behavioral problems are suffi-\nciently complex and volatile, tomorrow is not like today, and the environmental\nvolatility is such that by the time the training sets are developed they are no\nlonger useful and that it is unlikely that all information can be known and pro-\ncessed \u2013 at least in the time available.\nConsequently, this class of ML models are, like other rational actor models,\n(i) too fragile to be used in the wild, (ii) don\u2019t reflect human heterogeneity, and\n(iii) have a very short shelf-life.\nLevent Yilmaz: Realistic Models Must Include Cognitive Biases\nand Limitations\nIn social and behavioral modeling, realism requires modeling human behavior\nin such a way that the cognitive biases as well as limitations are accurately\ncaptured in accordance with empirical observations. Some may argue that\nsuch differences may cancel each other in the aggregate. This may be the\ncase for some applications. Yet, adversarial behavior modeling may require\nus to account for our opponent\u2019s biases and perspectives to develop robust\nstrategies. Similarly, heuristics and biases in human decision-making are\nwidely reported. The limitations of the use of Kolmogorov axioms of prob-\nability in classical decision-making has also been reported as error-prone.\nMore recently, quantum cognition models are promoted to address the\norder effects and conjunction fallacies observed in actual human behaviorDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

More research and development is needed to streamline\nthe programming of agents that can exhibit such quantum like behavior.\nScott Neal Reilly: High Degree Realism Entails Costs That May Not Be\nOutweighed by Their Benefits\nI wholeheartedly agree that we need more realistic models than have often been\nused in the past. I think the more interesting question is what level of abstrac-\ntion does the realism need to live at? In other words, I think Axtell\u2019s breakdown\nis great and I find it hard to imagine for people arguing we should live in the sim-\nplistic column instead of the realistic column. That said, I think the two-column\npresentation suggests more of a dichotomy than a spectrum, and I wonder if\nEpstein is going too far along that spectrum in his call for cognitively plausible\nagents that are grounded in neuroscience. I suspect Prof. Epstein and I would\nagree that you only need to model down to the right level, as I don\u2019t see him call-\ning for our models to go to the level of atoms or quarks. The question is whether\ncognitive or neurological realism is important for most social science prob-\nlems. I am sure that he is right that additional levels of realism could provide\nus with powerful new insights that cannot be gained from a purely behavioral\nlevel of realism, but I suspect there is a spectrum from simpler models that\nprovide certain kinds of insights and are useful to certain kinds of problems to\nsomething cognitively/neurologically plausible, which would be applicable to\nother problems. I also think it is important to recognize the complexity, effort,\nand cost (and, for the record, chance for bugs and other errors) that comes from\nthe kinds of fidelity required for cognitive and neurological plausibility and\nto determine whether the costs of that kind of fidelity are worth the benefits.\nLet me give a simple example from a rather different domain: what if you want\nto model the game of craps to explore the outcomes associated with various\nstrategies? In this case, there is no benefit to modeling the physics of each die\nfalling and bouncing off the table instead of using a random-number generator.\nIf you want to understand the dynamics of tumbling cubes, you need to go down\nto the physics level, but for understanding the dynamics of the craps game,\nyou just need plausibly realistic behavior on the part of the dice at the level of\nwhich face ends up facing up. Similarly, models of human behavior might need\nto go to the cognitive and neurological levels to answer certain questions, but\nif we have simpler means to get realistic behavior at the level that matters for\ninteresting social science questions, then I think we need to explicitly reason\nabout the cost\u2013benefit trade-offs of various levels of realism for the problem\nat hand.\nTed Pavlic: With Additional Realism Comes Additional Liability\nIt is difficult for me to persuade myself to agree with anything in this prompt,\nand I do not believe that Table 33.1 is convincing. The term simplistic is obvi-\nously a straw man meant to be knocked down by (wait for it) realistic models.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nGoing Beyond Rational Actors 783\nAgain, realism is never the goal in any modeling endeavor. Models need not\nbe realistic to be insightful. Moreover, the word realistic is a comparable\nadjective \u2013 it is possible for some models to be more realistic than others, but\nthere is no such thing as a most realistic model. Even when experimenting\nwith real populations of people, any insights gained from those experiments\nmay not generalize to other populations or even other times. With additional\nrealism comes additional liability \u2013 every small bit of realism added to a model\nis another assumption that may not be met in reality. Models should be as\nrealistic as they need to be to answer a question, but no more. Might it be\nimportant that agents can exist in sad or happy states and have different\nbehavioral rules depending on their state? It\u2019s possible. Does it make a model\nmore realistic if 1000 (or even 1 million) virtual agents are constrained to a\ncrystalline lattice and update their interactions with their close neighbors\nbased on their current emotional state (happy or sad)? That still sounds like\nan unrealistic model to me, and it is arguably less realistic than a simplistic\nmodel with well-mixed agents that have no emotional states. Furthermore,\nnew results from neuroscience show that some aspects of deliberation occur\nafter scans of the brain indicate that a decision has already been made. So, our\nintrospection may create the illusion of deliberation when (at least some of )\nthe underlying decision mechanisms are occurring much more quickly.\nGetting back to Tinbergen (1963), it is important not to confound proximate\ncausation (mechanisms) and ultimate causation (adaptive function). In fact,\nthis error poses the greatest risk to baking in emergent phenomena. It would\nbe strange to assume that an individual human moves around looking to\nmaximize his or her number of offspring produced, and yet some other\nbehavior (like responding to hunger signals by eating) may tend to increase\nthe success of that individual. Very often when realism is added to a model,\nit provides a back door to taking for granted that which was to be shown.\nFurthermore, terms like bounded deliberative capacity sounds almost as if\nadaptive function is being introduced at the individual level as opposed to\nbeing a product of other mechanisms. Rather than developing some model of\ndeliberative capacity and then bounding it for an agent, it would be possible\nto build in mechanisms from cognitive psychology meant to characterize\ndecision-making accuracy and latency \u2013 like DFT models (e.g. drift\u2013diffusion\nmodeling for two-alternative force choice [TAFC] tasks). Implementing a\nDFT mechanism on an agent would be much simpler and would capture the\nimportant features of decision-making without having to actually develop a\ntheory of how decisions are made that is almost certainly wrong.\nThe other downside of making models too realistic is that they become as\ninscrutable as the systems that we are using them to help explain. Once the\ncomputational model becomes so difficult to explain that a statistical model is\nused as a meta-model for the phenomena (i.e. the statistical model describes\nthe computational model that describes the realistic phenomena), then it may\nnot be necessary to have the computational model.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

There are only models. Electrons don\u2019t exist. Newton\u2019s laws\nare only approximations. The general theory of relativity is just a framework for\ndescribing space time. Some enterprising young graduate student may develop\nnew theories of particle physics next year that better explain our observations\nwithout having to posit the existence of an electron. Similarly, our under-\nstanding of neuroscience is constantly changing. Neural networks themselves,\nwhich can be viewed as models, have gone through three major generations of\ndevelopment \u2013 from binary to general activation functions to spiking neural\nnetworks \u2013 and there could be more. The properties of neural networks\nfundamentally change when moving from second- to third-generation neural\nnetworks; however, that does not mean that a good model of human society\nrequires that every agent make decisions that make use of a spiking neural\nnetwork. Good modeling is both about getting the internal structure right and\nabout drawing good boundaries around the things that matter and the things\nthat can be approximated away. \u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful\u201d\n(Box 1976).\nReferences\nAnselin, L.

Rouse\nAlexander Crombie Humphreys Chair, School of Systems and Enterprises, Stevens Institute of Technology,\nCenter for Complex Systems and Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA\nIntroduction\nWe use models to answer questions and solve problems. Often these problems\ninvolve designing solutions in terms of physical form, functional capabilities,\nand policies intended to enable, incentivize, or inhibit particular behaviors. The\nkey point is that models are intended to support problem-solving including\nbroad problems, such as \u201cHow does this system work? What is going on?\u201d\nIn other words, models are not ends in themselves. Instead, they are a means\nfor addressing the ends of problem-solving. Thus, not only do we want mod-\nels to be scientifically and technically valid. We want them to be an acceptable\nmeans to the problem solvers of interest. We also want them to be viable in\nterms of being worth the effort to learn and employ in problem-solving.\nIt is useful to distinguish between two very different types of overarching\nquestions. Understanding the nature of problems often involves assessing\nwhat is. This is the realm of, among other things, big data. In contrast, solving\nproblems often also involves asking \u201cwhat if\u201d and \u201cunder what conditions?\u201d\n(Davis 2019). Addressing these questions typically involves exploring possibili-\nties that have never been tried before. Visualization and computational models\nare used to predict the consequences of such possibilities under various\nassumptions or, often, to understand the potential consequences while dealing\nwith uncertainty.\nThis chapter summarizes a long history of personal experiences developing\nmodels to address what-if questions. Thus, I use the pronoun I throughout.\nThese experiences start with submarines in 1967 and end with driverless\ncars in 2017. I consider the modeler as a user, advisor, facilitator, integra-\ntor, and explorer in the contexts of aerospace and defense, electronics and\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

The\nmodeling lessons learned from these many experiences are summarized. More\nbroadly, I provide observations on model-based problem-solving.\nModeler as User\nI started at Raytheon in 1967 after completing my sophomore year as a summer\nintern. I came back the following summer as well and then worked half time\nduring my senior year as an assistant engineer. I worked at the Submarine Signal\nDivision in Portsmouth, RI.\nOne major assignment was to determine how many spare parts for the\nsonar system, for each type of part, should be carried on a submarine.\nSpace, obviously, is at a premium on a submarine, so that was the major\nconstraint. I needed to take into account the failure rates of parts, as well as\nthe consequences of their failing and there being no spares.\nThe end result was a deck of almost 1000 IBM cards that simulated the failure\nand repair of the sonar system over the course of a mission. Since failures were\nrandomly generated, multiple runs were needed to generate probability distri-\nbutions of system availability. This consumed quite a bit of computer time, with\nthe results coming back hours later.\nI named this simulator MOSES, which stood for Mission-Oriented Systems\nEffectiveness Synthesis. I would submit my deck of cards at the computer center\nand check back in a couple of hours. I got to know the people there pretty well.\nWhen I asked if the MOSES results were back, they often responded, \u201cNo, he\nis still wandering in the wilderness.\u201d\nI was the only person in the Reliability and Maintainability Department that\nunderstood MOSES. I was the only user. People posed questions, and I figured\nout how to get MOSES to answer them, sometimes requiring extensions of\nthe software. Being the only user eventually limited my opportunities on other\nprojects. This not only provided job security but also caused me to feel trapped.\nI wanted to build models that other people would use to address questions in\ntheir jobs. As the stories that follow illustrate, this turned out to be much more\ndifficult than I anticipated.\nModeler as Advisor\nAs a faculty member at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the\nmid-1970s, I encountered an interesting problem associated with the Illinois\nLibrary and Information Network (ILLINET). They processed millions of\nrequests per year for library and information services, ranging from reference\nquestions to interlibrary loans.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The state compensated each node in the network for each\nservice transaction provided, even those transactions that were unsuccessful.\nWe developed a network model to predict network performance in terms of\naverage time until service success, average cost of service success, and proba-\nbility of service success.\nThe goal was to determine request routing strategies that would minimize\ntime and cost and maximize probability of success. An analytic solution of this\nqueuing network problem was derived. The model was parameterized using\nlarge data sets available from the state. A forecasting model was developed to\nenable updating of parameters. Numerous case studies were performed at the\nsystem and state level (Rouse and Rouse 1980).\nThe model served to integrate substantial knowledge about ILLINET. In\ntoday\u2019s terminology, it was very much evidence based. It was delivered to the\nstate as contractually required. We continued to work with them over several\nyears. Occasional calls asking questions about one thing or another indicated\nthat the model was being used. However, my sense was that usage depended\non our being available as advisors.\nModeler as Facilitator 1\nI founded Search Technology in 1980 with Russ Hunt. We focused on\nsimulation-based training and intelligent decision support systems. Our pri-\nmary customers were electric utilities and the US defense industry. During the\n1980s, we developed a methodology termed human-centered design (Rouse\n1991, 2007). Human-centered design is a process of considering and balancing\nthe concerns, values, and perceptions of all the stakeholders in a design. By\nstakeholders, I mean users, customers, developers, maintainers, and competi-\ntors. The premise of human-centered design is that the major stakeholders\nneed to perceive methods and tools to be valid, acceptable, and viable.\nValid methods and tools help solve the problems for which they are intended.\nAcceptable methods and tools solve problems in ways that stakeholders prefer.\nViable methods and tools provide benefits that are worth the costs of use. Costs\nhere include the efforts needed to learn and use methods and tools, not just the\npurchase price.\nIn the late 1980s, several of our customers asked us to teach them how to do\nhuman-centered design. The result was a series of workshops that we delivered\nquite frequently. Workshop participants suggested that we create a series of\n1 This section discusses a suite of tools for which I led the development. The central point is not\nthese specific tools, but the lessons learned in creating and employing them to help literally\nthousands of users.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n794 Human-Centered Design of Model-Based Decision Support for Policy and Investment Decisions\nbooks that captured the content of the workshops, including the many case\nstudies presented. The result was a series of three books published by John\nWiley (Rouse 1991, 1992, 1993).\nOnce the books were provided during the workshops, participants had\nanother suggestion. One participant put it crisply, \u201cWe don\u2019t really want to\nread these books. We would like tools such that in using the tools we would\nbe inherently following the principles in the books.\u201d Another participant said,\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just want knowledge; we want executable knowledge.\u201d\nWe agreed with the idea but we were very slow getting started. Finally, two\ncustomers, independently, offered to buy corporate-wide licenses for the tools\neven though they \u2013 and we \u2013 did not know what they were buying. The initial\npayments toward these licenses provided the resources to get started.\nThe first tool was the Product Planning Advisor (PPA). This tool embodied\nthe principles of human-centered design, built around multi-stakeholder,\nmulti-attribute utility theory (Keeney and Raiffa 1976), and quality function\ndeployment (Hauser and Clausing 1988); see Figure 34.1. This eventually\nbecame our best-selling tool (Rouse and Howard 1993), but it did not get there\nsmoothly.\nWe formed user groups at the two companies that had committed resources\nand asked everyone in both groups what they wanted the tool to do.

When we demonstrated the prototype, virtually,\nevery user was overwhelmed. We had provided what they wanted, but it had\ntoo many options, modes, etc.\nWe went back to the drawing board and redesigned PPA to only provide the\nfunctions and features that everybody had requested. This would have also been\nproblematic if the consensus requests were foolish. However, the consensus\nrequests were very sensible.\nThis version was a success, and we eventually sold many hundreds of copies\nto over 20 well-known companies. PPA was sold in conjunction with training\nworkshops where participants learned human-centered design and the use of\nPPA, all in the context of real product planning problems of importance to their\ncompanies.\nMuch to our surprise, the services associated with PPA and our other tools\n(described below) went well beyond training. We were repeatedly asked to facil-\nitate workshops associated with new product planning endeavors, despite most\nof the participants in the workshops having been trained earlier. Consequently,\nwe facilitated many workshops for customers that included Digital, Honeywell,\nMotorola, Rolls-Royce, and Rover.\nI asked a senior executive why these services were continually needed.\nHis response was, \u201cI am not at all concerned with the costs of your software\nand services. I am totally concerned with the overall costs of success. Your\ninvolvement lowers those costs.\u201d Having facilitated hundreds of product\nplanning workshops across many industries, we could share many lessons\nlearned. These cross-industry perspectives were highly valued.\nOur next tool was Business Planning Advisor (BPA). This emerged when\na senior executive observed, \u201cYour product planning process has helped us\ntremendously, but it is inconsistent with how we run the overall company.\nCould you take a look at that for us?\u201d This led to expanding our focus to the\noverall enterprise. We formed a subsidiary, Enterprise Support Systems, which\neventually became an independent company in 1995.\nBPA did not sell as well as PPA. There were too many competing software\npackages in the marketplace. It served a role in that our customers expected us\nto have such a tool, but it did not have as unique a value proposition as PPA.\nWe did end up facilitating a seemingly countless number of executive off-sites,\nnot because we wanted to have such a service line, but because we did not want\ncustomers to retain our competitors.\nNext was the Situation Assessment Advisor (SSA). This tool was an expert\nsystem-based tool where users answered 50+ questions about their company,\nproducts and services, and competitors. It would then tell them which situ-\nations they were in and where they were headed, all based on an associated\nbook, Start Where You Are (Rouse 1996). The most popular feature was theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However,\nsales were not impressive. We had created a tool that a small team used perhaps\nonce per year. They would buy one copy. In contrast, many people used PPA\nfrequently. Companies would buy 25\u201350 copies, motivated in part by a break\npoint in the pricing.\nOur next book was Don\u2019t Jump to Solutions: Thirteen Delusions That Under-\nmine Strategic Thinking (Rouse 1998a). This book came with an expert system\ntool for assessing the extent to which the reader\u2019s company was beset by any\nof the thirteen delusions. The book was selected by Doubleday as their book of\nthe month and was the main selection, with the software tool included. Many\nthousands of copies sold, but the price point ($59.95 for book plus tool) needed\nhundreds of thousands of sales to make it worthwhile. We did get some pub-\nlicity when the book won an award as one of the top 20 management books\npublished globally that year.\nI often asked executives what tools they might want next. One answer was,\n\u201cHow are my current R&D investments likely to affect the financial future of\nthe company, and how should such projections affect what we invest in now?\u201d\nThe result was the Technology Investment Advisor (TIA), with Motorola as the\nlead customer.\nThe core of TIA was an option pricing model along with product life cycle\nmodels and production learning models (Boer 1999; Rouse et al. 2000). TIA\nwas rolled out across Motorola Labs and used extensively by 3M, Coca-Cola,\nIEEE, Lockheed, Raytheon, and the Singapore Ministry of Defence. It included\na substantial service component as the notion of real options required very\nknowledgeable support (Boer 1999). Over 30 significant engagements resulted\n(Rouse and Boff 2004).\nWe marketed PPA, BPA, SAA, and TIA as the Advisor Series of planning\ntools, summarized in Figure 34.2. PPA sold the most copies by far. Both PPA\nand TIA generated substantial service revenues, the latter because of the con-\nceptual difficulties customers often had buying into the notion of investing in\noptions that might or might not be exercised. People would ask me why one\nshould invest in something that you likely might not use. I would respond,\n\u201cDoes anyone in the room regret that you did not use your life insurance last\nyear?\u201d\nAll of the tools in the Advisor Series involved facilitating groups to build mod-\nels to address their questions of interest. The tools were primarily just compu-\ntational frameworks that users populated with their knowledge. Some training\nwas needed, but, as most users were technically educated, this was not difficult.\nWhat surprised us was how much ongoing facilitation was needed.\nLater in this chapter, I address how these tools were evaluated. At this point,\nhowever, it is worth mentioning the primary focus of the facilitation.

However, much more of the facilitation\nfocused on how to think about markets, stakeholders, and competitors. Often\nthis involved dragging the teams away from technical details before they had\nfully framed the market and technology opportunities.\nModeler as Integrator\nI returned to academia in 2001 as chair of the School of Industrial and Systems\nEngineering at Georgia Tech. My 13 years of experience running two compa-\nnies and working with thousands of executives and senior managers as our\ncustomers had convinced me that enterprises as complex systems was an area\nworthy of research (Rouse 2001, 2004). I focused in particular on enterprise\ntransformation in the sense of understanding and enabling fundamental change\n(Rouse 2006).\nI soon became immersed in the healthcare enterprise ecosystem \u2013 patients,\nproviders, suppliers, payers, and regulators. I had served in a consulting\nrole to the executive team of the American Cancer Society in the late 1990s.\nI now became involved in collaborative efforts between the National Academy\nof Engineering and the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of\nMedicine). We soon focused on how systems engineering models could\nprovide value as we strived to create an evidence-based learning health system.\nCo-chairing a couple of initiatives with Institute of Medicine (IOM) mem-\nbers, it struck me that we needed to create a real model to show people what itDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We decided to create a multilevel model of\nEmory University\u2019s prevention and wellness program for their employees. The\nquestion was how to scale up a pilot program for a cohort of 700 employees to\n60 000 covered lives. The vice president for human resources (HRs) wanted to\nbe confident in a positive return on investment.\nWe completed the first version of this model in four months. It quickly\nbecame clear that demonstrations of this model at the academies were all just\nan abstraction if we could not provide committee members hands-on expe-\nrience varying assumptions and intervention choices and, of course, seeing\nresults. This caused us to pay careful attention to interactive visualizations that\nmade model usage interesting and, hopefully, compelling (Rouse 2015).\nAt one point, the committee members with medical backgrounds asked,\n\u201cWhat do you call this thing?\u201d I said it was a multilevel enterprise model. There\nwere just blank stares. Thinking quickly, I said it is like a flight simulator for\nevaluating health policies, albeit without the accuracy possible for a purely\nengineered system like an aircraft. Everyone nodded with understanding. The\nphrase policy flight simulator was embraced and continues to evolve (Rouse\n2014, 2015) (Figure 34.3).\nFour projects focused on developing policy flight simulators for Emory\nHealthcare, Vanderbilt Health, Indiana Health, and Penn Medicine focused on\nhypertension, diabetes milletus, coronary heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\nand transition care for elderly patients, respectively. We also developed a\nsimulation of the New York City healthcare ecosystem that included rich\ncomponent models for the many (over 60) hospital corporations in the city.\nThis model was used to understand patterns of mergers and acquisitions.\nFigure 34.3 Policy flight simulator for New York City health ecosystem.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nModeler as Explorer 799\nThese model development projects focused on integrating models of\nclinician and patient decision-making, flow models of delivery processes,\nmicroeconomic models of providers and payers investment decisions, and\nmacroeconomic models of economic and health policies. The structures of\nthese models were informed by the medical literature as well as findings from\noperations research, behavioral economics, and so on. The parameters of these\nmodels were estimated from a range of large data sets on diseases, interven-\ntions, providers, and payers (Rouse and Cortese 2010; Rouse and Serban 2014).\nTeams of modelers and healthcare professionals accomplished all of these\nprojects. These teams identified key questions, relevant data sets, and appro-\npriate component models. Succinctly, the value added was in the integration\nof the components, rather than the components with which many stakeholders\nwere already familiar.\nOne particular comment was very cogent. A well-known medical thought\nleader said, \u201cYou have pulled everything together into an integrated,\nuser-friendly interface that includes data from clinical trials, our patient\ndata, medical effectiveness models, and business economics models. I can\nexplore my business issues without having to find all these pieces.\u201d\nThese models provided a means for these teams to explore the issues for\nwhich they were responsible. The development process involved coproduction\nof an evidence-based tool for exploration of these issues. For example, the mod-\nels were used to understand and redesign processes to enable economic scaling\nof innovative pilot tests into much broader application.\nModeler as Explorer\nRecently, our team at Stevens has been using computational models to explore\nthe dynamics of technology adoption, particularly in the automobile indus-\ntry. Working with General Motors, we studied the adoption of new powertrain\ntechnologies, ranging from internal combustion innovations to hybrid, electric,\nand hydrogen fuel cell propulsion systems. Working with Accenture, we have\nalso considered likely scenarios for adoption of autonomous vehicle technolo-\ngies, including the impacts of adoption on the auto insurance and auto finance\nindustries.\nThese efforts have involved extensive interactions with subject matter\nexperts. For example, the study of the impact of autonomous vehicles on the\ninsurance industry involved over 60 meetings with industry experts from\nAccenture and their clients. The model served as a means for joint exploration\nof the problem space. Thus, as elaborated elsewhere in this book (Davis 2019),\nmost of the early discussions focused on the extent to which all relevant\nphenomena were included and represented appropriately. Discussions also\naddressed identifying data sets to parameterize representations.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The overall goal was to create a forecast of the impacts of technol-\nogy adoption with which everyone was comfortable. For example, one partic-\nular assessment was discussed in depth, namely, that electric vehicles will not\nsignificantly benefit the environment if the electricity for charging the vehicles\nis produced in coal-fired power plants.\nTo a great extent these applications were model-based discussions laced with\navailable although often uncertain relevant evidence. The model was a means\nrather than an end. The intense discussions surrounding the development and\nuse of the models served to raise issues of attributes and structure and eventu-\nally facilitated reaching consensus on the scenarios of interest to the companies\ninvolved.\nValidating Models\nAs noted in the chapter\u2019s Introduction, the models summarized here were\ndeveloped to address what-if questions. The possible futures we were\nconsidering inherently did not exist. Further, we were usually predicting\nyears into the future. Hence, empirical validation of our predictions did not\nmake sense.\nThis was further complicated by our predictions of probability distributions\nrather than just expected values. In several cases, we were predicting probabil-\nity distributions for several scenarios. How can predictions of sets of probability\ndistributions be validated?\nA limited type of validation can be conducted by predicting the performance\nof the status quo system. If the models fail this test, something is wrong some-\nwhere. However, full empirical validation is inherently not possible. Thus, the\npredictive validity of the models will remain in question. How can we really\nknow that our predictions will come to be true?\nThe simple answer is, \u201cWe cannot.\u201d Nevertheless, this is not a fatal flaw if the\ngoal is insights rather than predictions. If the goal is to understand why ideas\nmight work or not \u2013 might be good ideas or bad ideas \u2013 then the models can\nbe used to provide prediction-based insights. We can learn what might happen\nand the conditions under which these possibilities are likely to happen.2 We\nmight then try to influence these conditions.\nExperience has shown that this is a good way to quickly discard bad ideas and\nto refine good ideas for subsequent empirical evaluation. We can determine\n2 This experience is precisely what is discussed in Davis (2019) of this volume as exploration with\ncoarse prediction (see also Davis et al. 2018). As in that chapter, we were going beyond what-if\nquestions to ask \u201cunder what conditions?\u201d questions.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

We can also learn the conditions\nunder which apparently good ideas are likely to succeed. Such insights are the\nhallmarks of creative and successful problem-solving.\nAnother approach to validity focuses on the decision-makers. Do they feel\nthe model helps them make better-informed decisions? Is their gut level of\ncomfort higher? As a model builder, I seek feedback on the extent to which\nthe model influenced their decisions. I also look at the decisions made and\nresources involved. For example, the use of TIA resulted in decisions involving\nmany billions of dollars (Rouse and Boff 2004).\nModeling Lessons Learned\nThis chapter has summarized my experiences developing models to address a\nrather broad range of problems over the past 50 years. What have I learned? In\nthis section, lessons learned about modeling are summarized. The next section\nconsiders lessons learned about problem-solving.\nIt is useful to summarize modeling lessons learned in the context of develop-\ning and deploying policy flight simulators (Rouse 2014, 2015). There are eight\ntasks associated with creating and using policy flight simulators:\n\u2022 Agreeing on objectives \u2013 the questions \u2013 for which the simulator will be con-\nstructed.\n\u2022 Formulating the multilevel model \u2013 the engine for the simulator \u2013 including\nalternative representations and approaches to parameterization.\n\u2022 Designing a human\u2013computer interface that includes rich visualizations and\nassociated controls for specifying scenarios.\n\u2022 Iteratively developing, testing, and debugging, including identifying faulty\nthinking in formulating the model.\n\u2022 Interactively exploring the impacts of ranges of parameters and conse-\nquences of various scenarios.\n\u2022 Agreeing on rules for eliminating solutions that do not make sense for one\nor more stakeholders.\n\u2022 Defining the parameter surfaces of interest and production runs to map these\nsurfaces.\n\u2022 Agreeing on feasible solutions and the relative merits and benefits of each\nfeasible solution.\nThe discussions associated with performing the above tasks tend to be quite\nrich. Initial interactions focus on agreeing on objectives, which includes output\nmeasures of interest, including units of measure. This often unearths differing\nperspectives among stakeholders. I have often encountered people who have\nknown each other for years but did not realize they had conflicting perspectives.\nThe modeling process tends to unearth such differences.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Component\nmodels are needed for these phenomena, and agreeing on suitable vetted, and\nhopefully off-the-shelf, models occurs at this time. Also of great importance\nare uncertainties associated with these phenomena, including both structural\nand parametric uncertainties.\nAs computational versions of models are developed and demonstrated, dis-\ncussions center on the extent to which model responses are aligned with expec-\ntations. A typical overall goal is to computationally redesign the enterprise.\nHowever, the initial goal is usually to replicate the existing organization to see\nif the model predicts the results actually being currently achieved.\nOnce attention shifts to redesign, discussion inevitably shifts to the ques-\ntion of how to validate the model\u2019s predictions. As these predictions inherently\nconcern organizational systems that do not yet exist, validation is limited to dis-\ncussing the believability of the insights emerging from debates about the nature\nand causes of model outputs. In some cases, deficiencies of the models will be\nuncovered, but occasionally unexpected higher-order and unintended conse-\nquences make complete sense and become issues of serious discussion.\nModel-based policy flight simulators are often used to explore a wide range of\nideas. It is quite common for one or more stakeholders to have bright ideas that\nhave substantially negative consequences. People typically tee up many alterna-\ntives for organizational designs, interactively explore their consequences, and\ndevelop criteria for the goodness of an idea. A common criterion is that no\nmajor stakeholder can lose in a substantial way. For the Emory simulator, this\nrule pared the feasible set from hundreds of thousands of configurations to a\nfew hundred.\nQuite often, people discover the key variables most affecting the measures of\nprimary interest. They then can use the simulator in a production mode, without\nthe graphical user interface, to rapidly simulate ranges of variables to produce\nsurface plots. Discussions of such surface plots, as well as other results, provide\nthe basis for agreeing on pilot tests of apparently good ideas. Such tests are used\nto empirically confirm the simulator\u2019s predictions, much as flight tests are used\nto confirm that an aircraft\u2019s performance is similar to that predicted when the\nplane was designed in silico.\nPolicy flight simulators serve as boundary spanning mechanisms, across\ndomains and disciplines and beyond initial problem formulations, which are\nall too often more tightly bounded than warranted. Such boundary spanning\nresults in arguments among stakeholders being externalized. The alternative\nperspectives are represented by the assumptions underlying and the elements\nthat compose the graphically depicted model projected on the large screen.\nThe debate then focuses on the screen rather than being an argument between\ntwo or more people across a table.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Workshop participants were asked what\nthey sought from computer-based tools for planning and design. Here is a sum-\nmary of their responses:\n\u2022 Teams want a clear and straightforward process to guide their decisions and\ndiscussions, with a clear mandate to depart from this process whenever they\nchoose.\n\u2022 Teams want capture of information compiled, decisions made, and linkages\nbetween these inputs and outputs so that they can communicate and justify\ntheir decisions, as well as reconstruct decision processes.\n\u2022 Teams want computer-aided facilitation of group processes via management\nof the nominal decision-making process using computer-based tools and\nlarge screen displays.\n\u2022 Teams want tools that digest the information that they input, see patterns\nor trends, and then provide advice or guidance that the group perceives they\nwould not have thought of without the tools.\nPolicy flight simulators can provide the engine that drives these capabilities,\nbut greater advisory capabilities are needed to fully satisfy all these objectives.\nA good example comes from the networked version of PPA that enabled teams\nto work remotely and asynchronously. When asked what they liked best about\nthis version, users did not comment on the modeling capabilities. Instead they\nexpressed great appreciation for a feature that was unique to this version.\nThe networked PPA kept minutes of every user transaction with the tool,\nincluding every proposed change and implemented change. Given that the tool\nknew each user and their issues of interest, we created a function called What\u2019s\nHappened Since I Was Last Here? When users clicked on this option, they were\nprovided with an explanation of how their issues of interest were addressed\nwhile they were away. They found this invaluable.\nA significant element of this value was due to being able to trace how deci-\nsions were made, what assumptions were agreed upon in the process, and why\ntrade-offs were resolved in particular ways. In one instance, PPA was used to\nplan seven generations of microprocessors, with each new generation begin-\nning by reviewing the PPA analyses of previous generations. The minutes pro-\nvided the rationale for decisions by people not involved in the new generation\nand perhaps no longer with the company.\nThe obvious conclusion from these modeling lessons learned is that people\nwant an environment that helps them address and solve their problems of inter-\nest. Computational models coupled to interactive visualizations provide some\nof this support. However, facilitation \u2013 human or otherwise \u2013 and capturing of\nminutes are also crucial elements of this support.

The models developed are\nmeans to the ends of solving problems. This chapter has summarized observa-\ntions of a large number of endeavors in terms of problems addressed and how\nthe problem-solving teams functioned. The observations can be clustered into\nstarting assumptions, framing problems, and implementing solutions.\nStarting Assumptions\nWho are the stakeholders in the problem of interest and its solution? It is\nessential that one identify key stakeholders and their interests. All critical\nstakeholders need to be aligned in the sense that impacts on their interests\nare understood. The consequences of not understanding these impacts can\nundermine any chance of consensus.\nLook at problems and solutions from the perspectives of stakeholders. How\nare they likely to be thinking? It is crucial to understand stakeholders\u2019 costs of\nchange. One should consider providing stakeholders the necessary services to\nenable change. These can be seen as elements of the overall solution. Thus, the\nsolution may be much larger than originally envisioned.\nArticulate and validate assumptions. Significant risks can result when there\nare unrecognized assumptions. It is important to validate assumptions before\ndeciding to invest in solutions suggested by models. This can sometimes be\ndifficult when key stakeholders know what is best (Rouse 1998a).\nUnderstand how other stakeholders may act. The effectiveness of a strategy\nis strongly affected by competitors. Your solution may cause them to react in\nways that decreases the attractiveness of the solution. Using one or more team\nmembers to play competitors\u2019 roles can often facilitate this.\nFraming Problems\nDefine value carefully. Translating invention to innovation requires clear value\npropositions, as illustrated by earlier discussions of new product planning and\ntechnology strategy. In both cases, value needed to be framed from the per-\nspective of the marketplace, not the inventors. Markets do not see their main\nrole as providing money to keep inventors happy.\nThink in terms of both the current business and possible future businesses.\nCurrent success provides options for future success but perhaps with differentDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The TIA was often used to explore how\ncurrent products and customers provide options for new products and cus-\ntomers.\nConsider possibilities for customizing solutions for different customers and\nconstituencies. The healthcare models discussed earlier required stratification\nand tailoring of processes to varying health needs. This was critical to the\neconomic viability of these health offerings. Henry Ford, almost 100 years\nago, was the last person to believe that everyone wanted exactly the same\nautomobile.\nAccess and integrate available data sets on customers, competitors, tech-\nnologies, etc. The healthcare examples showed how data integration increases\nconfidence. Great insights can be gained by mining available data sets, includ-\ning internal sets, publicly available sets, and purchasable sets.\nPlans should include strategies for dealing with legacies. The status quo can\nbe an enormous constraint because it is known, paid for, and in place. It is often\nnecessary to have plans to get legacies off the books. Discarding or liquidating\nassets for which one paid dearly can be painful (Jensen 2000). Nevertheless,\nit can be exactly the right thing to do, particularly during times of creative\ndestruction (Schumpeter 1976).\nImplementing Solutions\nIt can be great fun to pursue market and/or technology opportunities. Inno-\nvators can earn high payoffs, albeit with high risks, as was often the case for\nPPA and TIA projects. The key is to have the human and financial resources to\nsupport and sustain the commitment to innovate.\nIn stark comparison, crises are not fun. I have often seen the high costs\nand substantial consequences of delaying change. Typically, the status quo\nhas devoured most available human and financial resources. When change is\nunder-resourced, failure is quite common.\nThe existing enterprise can hold change back. Several of our engagements\ninvolved product companies considering adding service lines of business. The\ndifficulty of changing business models should be carefully considered. New\nbusiness opportunities may be very attractive, but if success requires substan-\ntially new business models, one should assess the enterprise\u2019s abilities to make\nthe required changes.\nChange should involve stopping as well as starting things. Stopping things\nwill likely disappoint one or more stakeholders. Our model-based efforts to\nexplore future scenarios for research universities (Rouse 2016) illustrated the\ndifficulty of keeping everybody supportive. The consequence is that the sta-\ntus quo dominates, especially when senior management team members were\nrecruited to be stewards of the status quo.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Often these problems\ninvolve designing solutions in terms of physical form, functional capabilities,\nand policies intended to enable, incentivize, or inhibit particular behaviors. The\nkey point is that models are intended to support problem-solving.\nInitially our models are limited to visualizations, perhaps just sketches. These\nvisualizations may evolve to become more elaborate and perhaps interactive.\nThey enable exploration of connections among entities and how relationships\namong entities work. Such visualizations are models. They express the prob-\nlem solver\u2019s perceptions of what phenomena matter, how they interact, and key\ntrade-offs.\nSometimes a good visualization is all that is needed. The problem-solving\ngroup\u2019s discussion and exploration of the visualization can lead to a conclusion\non how to proceed. In other situations, deeper explorations are needed.\nThese explorations may involve more formal representations of phenomena\nand relationships. Deep computation may be warranted but perhaps used\nsparingly.\nThe discussions and explorations usually lead to creative suggestions for\npossible courses of action. All the creativity comes from the group of problem\nsolvers, not computers. In other words, policy flight simulators seldom fly\nthemselves. Instead, computers provide the means to explore the implications\nof seemingly good ideas. Bad ideas are rejected and good ideas are refined,\nperhaps for empirical evaluation.\nThis whole process results in many graphs and perhaps surface plots. Models\nmay be revised and extended. The most powerful impact, however, is that the\nproblem-solving group develops a shared mental model of what effects what,\nwhat really matters, and what trade-offs are crucial (Rouse 2007, 2015). Mem-\nbers of the large number of groups with whom I have worked have repeatedly\ntold me that the resulting shared mental model was far more powerful than any\nof the graphs or plots produced.\nIt is not unusual for decision-makers to find that agreed upon valid results are\nnot acceptable or viable. In other words, the solution is arguably the right thing\nto do, but the changes implied are not acceptable, and the investments required\nare not seen as viable. Such assessments are seldom capricious. A particular\nsolution, while valid, may simply not work in their culture.\nNevertheless, I have found that evidence-based decision-making is not a nat-\nural act for many executives and senior managers. They are used to relying\non intuition, which makes complete sense for frequent and familiar situations\n(Klein 2003). However, the infrequent and unfamiliar situation they now face\nmerits a more analytical approach (Rouse 1998a, 2001, 2006, 2007).\nThere are three notions that can ease them into such an approach. First, it\nis important that they realize the supporting roles that models play. They doDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Second, interactive visualizations are central to such explorations.\nFinally, hands-on explorations by the decision-makers themselves can make a\nhuge difference. This transforms customers of models into owners of models.\nInterestingly, the models will have paid their way if the customers then make\ngood decisions, even if the customers explain the decisions in intuitive terms\nand barely mention the models, much less claim them as a trusted source of\ninsights.\nReferences\nBoer, F.P.

First, hypotheses regarding\nobserved or expected patterns between sets of people differentiated by group\nfeatures are proposed. Hypotheses are then tested through comparison of\nfeatures (e.g. gender, age, intervention, or treatment groups) on differences\nin outcome variables of interest (e.g. depression, well-being, recovery, etc.).\nOver time, gathered evidence is then used to judge whether repeated observed\nassociations among independent outcome variables are causal.\nHugely successful for understanding simple relationships, health researchers\nhave relied heavily on this structure, of which the patient/problem/population\u2013\nintervention\u2013comparison\u2013outcome (PICO) framework (U.S. National Library\nof Medicine 2018) is perhaps the most common example. The widespread\nadoption of PICO and related frameworks for framing good research questions\nis further facilitated by the widespread availability and training of researchers\nin statistical and methodological processes that complement such research\ndesigns. Increasingly, however, there is a growing understanding that the\nreal world of health and rehabilitation systems may not bend as easily to the\nstraightforward research methods that have largely dominated the field (Collie\net al. 2018).\nIn the field of post-injury rehabilitation, researchers readily acknowledge\nthe benefits of longitudinal vs. cross-sectional study designs (e.g. Ponsford\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

However, limitations associated with linear rather than dynamic\nmodeling processes are less well appreciated (Barton 1994; Kay and Schneider\n1994). This is true even within some of the more advanced theoretical and\nlongitudinal literature that attempts to clarify complex associations between\npredictors and outcomes (O\u2019Donnell et al. 2010, 2013; Thompson et al. 2014b;\nMurgatroyd et al. 2017). With few exceptions (Hirsh et al. 2007; Iezzi et al.\n2007; Liedl et al. 2010), do studies in the field of traumatic injury rehabilitation\ndeal with the potential influence of feedback mechanisms in their designs or\ndiscussions.\nFor instance, in considering the association between levels of depression\nand return to work among a group of injured people, traditional methodolo-\ngies conceptualize the relationship between depression and return to work\nas unidirectional rather than a potentially reinforcing loop (Montgomery\net al. 1999; Richmond et al. 2009; Carriere et al. 2015). Despite this approach,\nwhich is clearly at odds with the lived experience of patients and rehabilitation\nproviders, policy and practice recommendations are often consequently made\nfrom an evidence base built on studies that have investigated this relationship\non the basis that their original questions meet criteria for good research ques-\ntions as judged within a PICO framework. As a result, potential feedbacks are\nignored, are assumed to not exist, or are mentioned in the limitation section\nof academic papers only (e.g. Thompson et al. 2014c). In reality, variables or\nindividual factors under study within complex dynamic systems such as health\nmay be at once both independent and dependent variables; their isolation and\nindependence contrived more so to benefit internal validity than external.\nThe process of post-injury physical and mental health rehabilitation is par-\nticularly complex, and the trajectory of sometimes lengthy individual recovery\nis difficult to predict. Rehabilitation occurs amid a dynamic network of rela-\ntionships among patients, healthcare providers, compensation systems, legal\nprofessionals, legislators, rehabilitation coordinators, spouses, workplaces,\nfamilies, and a host of other stakeholders. Recovery is highly dependent upon\ninitial accident circumstances, individual demographic characteristics, and\npatients\u2019 understanding of their injury in the context of the remainder of their\nlives (Diller 2005; Thompson et al. 2014a,b). This degree of complexity and the\npractical difficulties in studying injured populations mean that studies using\nmore linear methodologies to represent individual recovery processes and the\ninteraction of individuals with systems limit their ability to provide effective\ndecision support in live settings. System managers acknowledge this, but at\npresent, they have little alternative. They have not been provided with a set of\nalternative tools that can overcome deficiencies in the traditional well-worn\napproach.\nThis may be a counterproductive situation for clinicians and health system\nmanagers that rely on such evidence as a basis of decision-making and who\nmust deal with members of populations at hand rather than their moreDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Whether\nthis is part of the reason for public health research\u2019s relatively low levels of\ninfluence on public health decision-making (Orton et al. 2011) is unclear, but\nit is hard to see how it assists. Public health and injury rehabilitation systems\ndo not have the luxury of filtering incoming patient cohorts. They cannot\nstop treating people who drop out (Thompson et al. 2011), disregard unusual\ncases or statistical outliers from inclusion or analysis, discount the presence\nof comorbid disorders, restrict age ranges and injury types, or ignore any\nother factors often associated with exclusion criteria demanded of typical\nintervention trial participants (Tuszynski et al. 2007). They must deal with all\npatients who present, regardless of circumstances and the impact that each\nmay have on overall health system performance.\nUnderstanding Health System Performance\nThere is argument to suggest that no accepted definition of health systems exists\n(Bowling 2014); however, this has not restricted effort expended during the past\ntwo decades on attempting to create common frameworks for assessing health\nsystem performance. Principally, these attempts have been centered on under-\nstanding the boundaries of health system responsibilities, the functions they\nperform, and how these functions translate into achievement of health system\ngoals and outcomes (Murray and Evans 2006; Duckett and Willcox 2015).\nMurray and Frenk (2000) describe the functions of health systems as com-\nprising stewardship, resource creation, financing, and service provision. Core\ngoals of the health system are then defined as improved performance across\nthree areas: responsiveness to community expectations, fairness in financial\ncontributions, and, ultimately, overall population health (see Figure 35.1).\nAdopting this framework, the World Health Organization (WHO) (2000) con-\nsiders that combined high levels of performance across these three elements is\nindicative of a well-functioning healthcare system.\nImproving health system performance requires an ability to understand\nthe effect of changing external states on system revenue and expenses and\nto respond appropriately through adjustment of available management and\npolicy levers (Gray et al. 2003). For example, post-crash injury rehabilitation\nsystems must have confidence in predicting levels of road trauma produced by\nthe transport system and the costs of trauma care, rehabilitation, and common\nlaw litigation associated with new and existing patients. Against this, expected\nrevenue gathered from taxation, fees, insurance premiums, or investment\nreturns from pooled resources must be set (Duckett and Willcox 2015; Motor\nAccident Insurance Commission 2016). These efforts to balance competing\npriorities are not always compatible, and, unless completely independent, each\nadjustment to system management or policy settings designed to solve current\nproblems sets in motion a new set of issues that may need to be addressedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Therefore, rather than being studied as entities\nmade up of a series of independent factors and relationships, health systems\nand their subcomponents may benefit from being investigated as they are \u2013\ncomplex systems comprising dynamic, interdependent relationships between\nfactors operating in an environment of fixed resources (Rutter et al. 2017).\nHealth systems lend themselves to study under new methodologies that can\naccount for heterogeneous actors, interdependent factors, and feedback loops\nnot possible using traditional linear techniques. However, while there have\nbeen repeated calls for public health scientists to embrace complex systems\nmethods (Pope and Mays 1993; Beresford 2010; Rutter et al. 2017; Tracy\net al. 2018), relatively few practical examples exist demonstrating the relative\nbenefits and limitations of such approaches applied to real-world settings.\nAgent-based modeling (ABM) is a technique that shows promise in over-\ncoming theoretical and practical difficulties associated with researching and\nunderstanding complex socio-technical systems such as health systems (Kana-\ngarajah et al. 2010). To explore the utility of using ABM to trial policy set-\ntings within a simulated real-world health system, we conducted an experiment\nwithin a state-owned, personal injury motor-vehicle insurance and transport\ninjury rehabilitation provider located in Australia (the health system). In con-\njunction with management staff, we undertook development of an ABM that\nreflected the function of the organization at a macro level, incorporating policy\nand operational mechanisms with the potential to influence overall system per-\nformance. The goal of the project was to trial various policy and resource man-\nagement scenarios to estimate effects on overall health system performance\n(Nikolic et al. 2013) as conceptualized under the WHO framework (Murray andDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Patient satisfaction (rated as satisfaction with the system on a scale out of\n10).\n2. Patient physical and mental health recovery outcomes (rated through\nself-reported scores on the SF-12 V2 physical and mental health scales\n(Ware et al. 1996).\n3. Duration of time patients had been involved in the health system since their\ncrash.\n4. Scheme forward liabilities.\n5. Scheme operational costs.\nMethod\nThe modeled health system was a stand-alone, state-owned personal injury\ninsurance, compensation, and rehabilitation system that provided support for\npeople following injury sustained in a motor-vehicle crash. The boundaries of\nthe system were considered to lie at the point at which the health system could\nnot influence either the behavior of the scheme or the characteristics of indi-\nviduals. For this reason, distributions of incoming individual patient character-\nistics such as gender, injury severity, attributions of responsibility for crashes\n(Thompson et al. 2014a), social support (Prang et al. 2015), presence of preex-\nisting injuries, illnesses or mental health conditions (Berecki-Gisolf et al. 2015),\nand a wait-list effect (Wideman et al. 2012) (where patient health improved at\na mean rate over time) were held constant over time within the model. The\nmodel, itself, was represented by an abstract two-dimensional space within\nwhich agents interacted with one another and was built using NetLogo 6.0\n(Wilensky 2016). Agents within the model consisted of patients, rehabilita-\ntion coordinators, physical health services, mental health services, and plaintiff\nsolicitors. All agents were modeled at the individual level \u2013 i.e. there were no\naggregate services. Patients entered the system at a random location in the envi-\nronment at a rate of 12 new patients per time step.\nPatients\nEach injured patient had a number of dynamic states that varied over the dura-\ntion of their existence in the system, including:\n1. Level of mental health.\n2. Level of physical health.\n3. Level of satisfaction with the health system.\n4.

Current number of pre-approved services available to each client they could\nuse before being required to make a new request.\nWithout treatment, patients improved their levels of mental health and phys-\nical health at an approximate rate consistent with a wait-list effect. They also\ndecreased their satisfaction with the scheme at a rate consistent with previous\nresearch demonstrating a reduction in levels of satisfaction with compensation\nschemes with longer duration recoveries (Thompson et al. 2015).\nRehabilitation Coordinators\nRehabilitation coordinators responded to requests for physical and mental\nhealth treatment from patients. When contacted by a patient, the rehabilitation\ncoordinator could pre-approve (with a manipulatable likelihood of between\n0% and 100%) a set number of treatment services per request, initialized\nat 6. Patients could only receive approval of services from rehabilitation\ncoordinators when the rehabilitation coordinator was not occupied dealing\nwith other patients\u2019 requests, reflecting capacity constraints within the system.\nIf a rehabilitation coordinator was busy, the patient continued to seek service\nfrom other random rehabilitation coordinators until their request had been\nsatisfied.\nPhysical and Mental Health Treatment Services\nTreatment services could only provide treatment to one patient at a time,\nreflecting capacity constraints within the system. To replicate diminishing\nreturns of treatment services as patients neared full health, treatment increased\nthe physical and/or mental health status of patients by a rate per interaction\nequal to the square root of the difference between the patient\u2019s current physical\nor mental health score and patients\u2019 maximum possible scores within either\ntheir physical or mental health domain (70). To recognize the relationship\nbetween physical and mental health, physical or mental health scores were\nthen multiplied by the patient\u2019s score in the alternative domain divided by the\nnormative population health mean (50). Importantly, both physical and mental\nhealth service providers could also refuse to provide treatment to individual\npatients if they did not want to deal with a compensable case, a common\nphenomenon whereby general practitioners or other medical providers refuse\nservice to compensable patients due to perceived administrative burden and\npayment delays (Brijnath et al. 2016).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In order to\nreflect poorer levels of recovery among patients who initiated litigation, solic-\nitors interacted with patients to reduce patients\u2019 satisfaction with the health\nsystem, mental health, and physical health by 5% on each interaction (Harris\net al. 2008). The overall number of solicitors in the model increased in response\nto a combination of poor mean patient mental health and low levels of satisfac-\ntion with the system. This drove an increased market for services, drawing more\nplaintiff solicitors into the system (Fitzharris et al. 2013).\nModel Narrative\nSeeking Treatment Service Approval from the Health System\nInjured patients entered the modeled system at an initial rate of 12 per time\nstep. Patients\u2019 immediate post-injury physical and mental health was randomly\nallocated around a normally distributed mean of 35 points with a standard devi-\nation of 5 points. The scoring system was designed to reflect the system\u2019s use of\nthe SF-12 for measuring the health of their injured population, a 12-item gen-\neral health questionnaire routinely used by the system to assess self-reported\nphysical and mental health functioning (Ware et al. 1996; Victorian Transport\nAccident Commission 2012).\nWhen patients entered the system, they searched within the model space\nfor a rehabilitation coordinator at a random location to approve health ser-\nvices for them if their current levels of mental or physical health were below a\ntreatment approval threshold set by health system policy (initially <45 points).\nWhen patients found an available rehabilitation coordinator, the patient could\nthen request treatment services. The rehabilitation coordinator then decided\nwhether to approve the patients\u2019 request (initially 90% of treatment requests\nwere approved). Approval of services assumed a satisfaction increase of 1%,\nwhile denial of services resulted in a decrease in satisfaction of 1%.\nIf the patient\u2019s treatment request was approved, the patient was provided with\nsix service credits to use before needing to return to request further services.\nIf the rehabilitation coordinator was either occupied with other patients or the\npatient\u2019s initial request for services was denied, the patient sought services from\nanother random rehabilitation coordinator in the system, delaying access to\ntreatment.\nSeeking Healthcare Services\nOnce patients had either mental health or physical health services approved\nby the rehabilitation coordinators, they then searched for a suitable mentalDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

If the health service\nwas not already dealing with requests from other patients, the healthcare\nprovider then either accepted or refused to treat the patient based on a\ndynamic likelihood of their propensity to accept compensable (i.e. insured by\nstate-run injury compensation system) patients (initialized at 80% acceptance).\nIf the request to treat was accepted, treatment occurred, and, dependent upon\nwhether the treatment was mental or physical in nature, the patient\u2019s health\nimproved in that respective domain by the mean effectiveness of physical or\nmental health treatment. The extent of improvement was rapid in the earlier\nstages of recovery and slowed toward the final stages as patients reached\nfull health.\nEach time a patient used a healthcare service, the allocated number of\npre-approved services was reduced by one unit until their service credits were\nexhausted. If they had not yet recovered, patients again sought approval from\nrehabilitation coordinators for additional treatment services.\nIn addition to seeking healthcare services through the approval mechanisms\nof the post-crash response system, the patient\u2019s movement within the system\nexposed them to contact with other patients and plaintiff solicitors, with whom\nthey exchanged information. When patients met other very unsatisfied, dis-\ngruntled patients in the scheme (with satisfaction scores <5), a small amount\nof the satisfaction of disgruntled patients was then transferred to other patients,\nreducing their level of satisfaction by 10%. While the direction of such changes\nto levels of satisfaction among patients is consistent with both internal organi-\nzational and independent research evidences related to the system (Thompson\net al. 2015), the magnitude of effect could not realistically be calibrated. Instead,\nit was tuned during model verification stages to reasonable assumptions of sys-\ntem managers\u2019 understanding of effects.\nExiting the Health System\nPatients existed within the health system until both their physical and men-\ntal health scores reached a threshold level above which they were considered\nto have recovered and were therefore ineligible to further assistance. Patients\u2019\nactivity status was also recorded as whether they had accessed any health ser-\nvices in the prior 100-day period. Patients could become inactive if they met\nthresholds for treatment but either had failed to have services approved by the\nsystem or had failed to find a treating healthcare provider in this time. The sig-\nnificance of inactive patients to the scheme is that this group consists of patients\nwho are still eligible to access services, but they have either not done so or are\nunable to do so. Therefore, they represented an ongoing financial and service\nliability to the system that could affect future performance.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Mean effects of each intervention\non scheme performance were then monitored over 30 iterations for a further\n1000 time steps (roughly equivalent to days) post-implementation to observe\naverage short-, medium-, and longer-term effects. Policy settings tested were:\n1.

Reducing approval rate of services by rehabilitation coordinators (i.e. reduc-\ning the approval rate of requested services by rehabilitation coordinators\nfrom 90% to 70%).\n3.

Inactive patients were given a nominal\nliability sum on the assumption they had exited the system with little likeli-\nhood of return. Following the principle of insight rather than numbers (Nikolic\net al. 2013), figures used for this estimation should be considered as monetary\nunits only.\nResults showed that Reducing eligibility to the scheme for patients demon-\nstrated immediate financial benefit for the health system following policy\nimplementation. However, as time elapsed, the advantage of this strategy was\nthen surpassed by all but two other strategies: Pre-approval of services and\ninvestment in Improved services. The potential costliness of investment in\nimproved services appeared to drive the result observed under this scenario.\nTo achieve better outcomes, the health service paid a 25% premium on top\nof existing rates, which, based on a dollar-for-dollar estimation, produced\na 25% increase in treatment effectiveness per interaction. The Pre-approval\nintervention ultimately became the strategy with the highest potential for\nincreasing liabilities because fewer delays and bottlenecks existed for patients\nto be able to access the services they desired. This resulted in more services\nbeing accessed by patients per period and therefore a higher projected forward\nliability estimate.\nThe most successful strategies for reducing estimated forward liabilities were\nEarly intervention and Improving road safety. Although the impact of these\nstrategies took longer to be realized by the system than through Reducing eligi-\nbility, and even increased projected liabilities for an initial period in the case of\nEarly intervention, their effect was ultimately greater and more stable, buoyed\nby the reduction in total patient numbers in the system that both strategies\nprovided.\nFigures 35.5 and 35.6 show the mean mental and physical health scores for\npatients at each time step. Results highlight three main points. Firstly, Early\nintervention was again the most successful strategy in improving overall patient\npopulation health. This was likely due to the improvement in health that Early\nintervention made among those at the earliest, most injured stages of recovery.\nThe second observation is that most other strategies produced similar overall\nresults, also reflecting observed consistency in real-world systems (Victorian\nTransport Accident Commission 2016). This highlights that in health sys-\ntems with fixed entry and exit thresholds, attempting to demonstrate health\nimprovements within a patient population using a cross-sectional design may\nnot be sensitive enough to easily distinguish between the performance of\ninterventions because only those patients who remain active within the service\n(or recently inactive) are surveyed (Thompson et al. 2014c). When measured\ncross-sectionally, each different cohort therefore continues to reflect a general\ninjured population with a similar mean health status containing upper and\nlower bounds.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

This strategy set in train a series of circumstances and feedback\nmechanisms that reinforced the ill health of the patient population, seeing\nit continue to decline over the course of the simulation. By increasing the\nthreshold for accessing services in the health system, mean patient mental and\nphysical health was immediately reduced as all patients who were previously\nwell enough to be eligible for services were excluded from the health system\nand therefore from analysis. The remaining less healthy group also had lower\nmean levels of satisfaction with the system (see Figure 35.7) (Thompson\net al. 2015), leading them to be more likely to engage with a plaintiff solicitor,\nwhich further reinforced their dissatisfaction with the health system and\nreported ill health (Barsky and Borus 1999; Matsuzawa and Dijkers 2014).\nFigure 35.7 shows that by contrast with patients\u2019 low levels of mean satisfac-\ntion in the Reducing eligibility intervention, Pre-approval of services and Early\nintervention strategies showed the greatest positive impact on satisfaction.\nWhile the effect of Early intervention is likely tied to the increase in mean\nphysical and mental health scores observed in Figures 35.5 and 35.6, the\neffect of Pre-approval of services can be understood by the fact that patients\nwere half as likely to experience a disapproval of a requested service, which\nreduced likelihood of incidents leading to dissatisfaction (i.e. service refusals).\nConsequently, patients were also more likely to be able to access health ser-\nvices faster, further reducing likelihood of becoming dissatisfied (Thompson\net al. 2015) and potentially engaging an attorney to sue the health system.\nFigure 35.8 shows the mean recovery durations of patients currently exist-\ning within the health system. Initially, strategies that focused on improving\nhealth service access reduced mean recovery durations more than Road safety\nand Early intervention, which produced the highest mean recovery durations\nof all strategies in the period immediately after implementation. This some-\nwhat counterintuitive result was because Road safety reduced the number of\nnew, young injuries into the health system, which pushed the mean toward\nolder, existing patients. Similarly, the result for Early intervention was due to\nthis intervention assisting newer patients to recover earlier in their claim, again\npushing the mean toward older, existing clients. However, despite initial poorer\noutcomes, both these strategies ultimately proved successful with Early inter-\nvention producing the lowest recovery durations and Road safety on trend to\nbecome the second most successful intervention by simulation end.\nIn contrast, Reducing eligibility was the most successful strategy for reducing\nmean recovery durations immediately following policy implementation. How-\never, by reducing thresholds for system entry, thresholds for exit were also low-\nered. By simulation end, mean recovery durations for patients in this interven-\ntion were trending steeply upward, indicating no long-term benefit.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Improved services and\nPre-approval perform reasonably on Responsiveness and Overall health but are\nultimately ranked lower due to estimated higher financial liabilities associated\nwith their implementation. The three mid-ranked strategies were headed by\nImprove coordinator access (fourth) followed by Do nothing (fifth) and Reduce\napproval (sixth).\nDiscussion\nThis work produced a model of a select real-world health system using a com-\nplex systems approach (ABM) that reflected behavior of the system in response\nto multiple policy interventions. Results showed that interventions focused on\npatient health including increasing speed and access to care as well as pri-\nmary prevention activities (e.g. Road safety) produced the highest performing\nhealthcare systems as judged by existing international frameworks (Murray and\nFrenk 2000; World Health Organization 2000). By contrast, strategies focused\non short-term financial performance of the system by reducing patient access to\nservices or increased expenditure on services with less than equivalent return\non health outcomes per unit of expenditure (Duckett and Willcox 2015) ulti-\nmately performed most poorly. In this regard, the difference in health system\nperformance across strategies when judged in the short term vs. long term\nwas stark.\nIt is important to acknowledge that these results are of a modeled health\nsystem built upon a high-level conceptualization and understanding of system\nactors and relationships that included a combination of empirical data and\nreasoned estimates from system managers with whom the model was built.\nIt therefore does not represent comprehensive truth in either its outputs or\nthe mechanisms by which they are generated.

However, the model does represent an approach to\ninvestigating the effect of health systems that has been widely called for (e.g.\nBeresford 2010; Rutter et al. 2017). It represents a working, explicit, replicable,\nand dynamic representation of a select health system built from both inductive\nand deductive investigations and codeveloped with health system managers\nthrough significant stakeholder engagement. At face value, it produces both\nsensible outcomes and insight into unusual health system behavior that is not\neasily predictable from thought experiments alone (Epstein 2008). Thus, it\ndemonstrates significant advantage over static representations of health system\nperformance and appears to meet Box\u2019s (1976) criteria of being both wrong\nand useful in that it has the potential to advance and accelerate knowledge of\nhealth system design through the device of theory\u2013practice iteration.\nTherefore, that this model does not contain all potential variants of the expe-\nrience of patients, the health system, treatment services, staff, or administrators\ndoes not render it invalid. As a tool for policy insight rather than numbers\n(Nikolic et al. 2013), it is an advantage. Very quickly, any system manager famil-\niar with parameters contained within the model could use it to test ideas or\ncombinations of interventions to gain better insight into their potential short-\nand long-term effects.\n\u201cIt may be baloney, but at least it\u2019s replicable baloney\u201d \u2013 Joshua Epstein,\nLecture on the 20th Anniversary of \u201cGenerative Social Science: Studies\nin Agent-Based Computational Modeling,\u201d George Mason University,\n2016.\nThe potential capacity of this type of low-investment, complex system\nmodeling to reduce uncertainty or amplify intelligence (Vinge and Euchner\n2017) in decision-making is therefore compelling (Milliken 1987). Within\nreal-world health systems, management and policy-makers cannot wait for the\ncompletion of inevitably imperfect and impractical system-level randomized\ncontrol trials prior to acting. Decisions will be taken or forced, regardless,\nand made based on implicit (i.e. ideas, intuition, and conjecture) or explicit\nmodels such as that demonstrated here. Neither provides perfect information;\nhowever the explicit computational model at least has the advantage of being\ntransparently built, tested, replicated, challenged, recorded, and iterated\n(Box 1976; Epstein 2008). This can be an extremely beneficial process, enabling\nmanagers and participants to visualize an otherwise abstract problem and\nbetter understand the mechanics and incentives contained for them and other\nactors in a system they may otherwise be unaware of (Rouse 2015; Tracy et al.\n2018). It is our contention that in the absence of such participatory modelingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Here, we construct either individual- or group-\nlevel competitions where participants act as managers of a fictional simulated\nhealth system that bears resemblance to the real one they are familiar with and\nhave assisted to build. Reiterating that the toy model is fictional is important\nas it removes a degree of defensiveness that can arise if managers feel overly\nprotective of strategies they are wedded to in a real system. Workshops range\nfrom those where we ask participants to meet or beat predefined performance\ntargets set by a fictional board of directors to those where groups have been\npitted against one another to create the highest performing healthcare sys-\ntem. In large-scale efforts involving up to 40 people at a time and immersive\nmultimedia rooms (see Figure 35.10), we have adapted a version of musical\nchairs, asking paired teams to select the likely highest performing systems from\na selection of 80 potential examples and explain to the remainder of the group\nwhy they chose their given system. All systems are then set to run simultane-\nously, enabling their performance to be monitored and compared against other\nteams\u2019 selections. We use these methods to both increase engagement with the\nmodel and overcome an issue in that the model is in reality both too simple\n(i.e. there are always potential elements of behavior in a real system not con-\ntained in the model that a participant could highlight in an attempt to discredit\nthe exercise) and potentially too complex to comprehensively explain in a one\nor two hour workshop (literally billions of potential policy combinations are\navailable within even the simplest of representations as described here). When\nfacilitated effectively, participants quickly move into the roles assigned to them.\nThe hands-on nature of the exercise helps to solidify their understanding of\nthe system dynamics in a manner that would be more difficult than through\ndescription alone. Though the enhancement of learning associated with this\nelement of the modeling exercise has not been our discrete focus so far, we\nplan to more formally assess this in the future.\nConclusions\nThe pursuit of methodological techniques that embrace complexity and\nreduce reliance upon methodological and statistical reductionism may provide\nconsiderable gains in our understanding of how health systems may be best\ndesigned and managed into the future.

Initially, the promise of technol-\nogy in warfare, from the perspective of the nation-state, was bright. Precision\ntargeting and stealth weapon technology helped the United States and its allies\nachieve victory quickly and easily against Iraq in the first Gulf War after Sad-\ndam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990. But even as America celebrated\nits seemingly easy victory over Iraq a few short months later, technology was\nchanging the nature of geopolitics and warfare in ways that were not obvious\nat the time and that would play out over decades.\nMartin van Creveld (1991) wrote about an emerging style of conflict that\nwould transform the way wars would be fought, which focused more on social\nand cultural rather than technical factors in the form of five questions. The\nfirst question is: by whom will war be fought? In the twentieth-century wars\nof great power competition, war was fought by expanding nation-states. In the\ntwenty-first century, van Creveld predicted that wars would instead be fought\nbetween nation-states and insurgents who seek to challenge the power and\nlegitimacy of the state. This type of warfare, which is referred to variously as\nlow-intensity conflict (LIC), operations other than war (OOTW), or counterin-\nsurgency (COIN), is both venerable and frequent as compared with great power\nwars but receives comparatively little attention by nation-states.\nThe second question is: who participates in war? That is, what are the rela-\ntionships between those who fight wars and the noncombatants? Traditionally,\nthe western way of war was conceived by Carl von Clausewitz (1873), who wrote\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

In the twenty-first century, this Clausewitzian trinity\nhas been expanded to include such other groups as nongovernment organi-\nzations (NGOs), multinational corporations (MNCs), terrorist organizations,\nand cross-border population flows, resulting in a more complex and confusing\npolitical environment.\nThe third question is: how is war fought? Traditionally, wars fought among\nthe great powers focused on similar and symmetric militaries that were\ncontrolled by leaders who made quick decisions and engaged in decisive\nbattles. The strategic decisions of the Napoleonic Wars, such as Waterloo, and\nthe blitzkrieg or lightning war of the Nazis in World War II are emblematic\nof this perspective. In the twenty-first century, van Creveld reasoned that\nwar would be fought asymmetrically between armies of the nation-state in\nuniforms and insurgents without uniforms. Insurgents do not fight decisively\nbut instead seek to wear down nation-states in protracted wars of attrition.\nThe fourth question is: for what is war fought? War for the nation-state is\nessentially rational, with Clausewitz calling it \u201can extension of politics pur-\nsued by other means.\u201d In the twenty-first century, according to van Creveld,\nwar would become not a logical means to an end but an affective end to itself.\nThat is, war would become increasing less rational and more emotional, with\ninsurgents attempting to draw great powers into their regional conflicts.\nThe fifth question is: why is war fought? The motivations of individual sol-\ndiers, traditionally, have centered on nationalism and patriotism. In the twenty-\nfirst century, van Creveld reasoned that the motivations of insurgents would be\nincreasingly driven by culture, religion, and identity politics.\nFrom these five guiding questions, a range of themes can be drawn out that\nportray a historical trajectory for the nation-state. The wars fought after 1945\nhave been primarily LICs that the purportedly more powerful nation-states\nlost. The nation-state armies however consistently train and equip to fight\nconventional force-on-force wars rather than the LICs they are most likely to\nface \u2013 and lose.\nAddressing these challenges requires the nation-state to rethink the training,\nprocurement, and data collection requirements of its militaries who are tasked\nwith engaging and confronting adversaries \u2013 both nation-states and insur-\ngents \u2013 which is the subject of this chapter. It also requires acknowledging the\nchanging strategies and tactics of adversaries in response to technology, which\nincludes social, narrative, organizational, and doctrinal changes (Arquilla\nand Ronfeldt 2001). This is done from a complex systems perspective that\nfocuses on the unintended doctrinal and strategic impacts of technology and\nattendant social changes. Advanced military technologies, while decisive in\nGulf War I, led to such unintended consequences as they diffused through-\nout the international system, and geopolitical competitors and insurgents\nchanged their behavior to avoid their effective use.

First, the writings of two near-peer competitors \u2013 China\nand Russia \u2013 are reviewed to understand how they think about these\ntwenty-first-century technology changes and propose to pursue their national\ninterests. Second, a system dynamics (SD) simulation model is developed that\nexplains the impact of information operations on the modern battlefield. Third,\nthe same technologies that impact the strategies of America\u2019s geopolitical\ncompetitors also drive its gray zone response (Mazarr 2015; USSOCOM 2015)\nto operations that fall short of war but are neither peace. The analytic gaps\nidentified in the SD simulation are used to generate requirements for a more\nsophisticated modeling capability that better support the analysis of gray\nzone and information operations. In conclusion, the need for advances in\nthe analysis of complex social systems affected by pervasive technology,\ninformation operations, and gray zone operations is discussed.\nThe Technological Transformation of War:\nCounterintuitive Consequences\nIt is generally acknowledged that technology has affected the way war is fought,\nespecially in the twenty-first century, but many of those impacts were not\nintended nor anticipated. Consequences that are unanticipated, unintended,\nor counterintuitive occur due to the social systems into which technology is\nintroduced because the resulting system complexity is beyond the ability of\nhuman cognition to understand and predict (Forrester 1971). For example,\nGulf War I of 1990 and 1991 \u2013 with its precision weapons, five-week air\ncampaign, hundred-hour ground campaign, and pervasive television cover-\nage \u2013 established the expectation that high-technology weapons would deliver\nquick and decisive victories with minimal cost and loss of life (Cordesman and\nWagner 1994).\nChina\nUS television audiences however were not the only people who took note of the\neffectiveness of America\u2019s high-technology weaponry. The Chinese military\nalso observed how quickly and easily the United States and its coalition\npartners defeated Saddam Hussein\u2019s military in Iraq and concluded that the\nbest way to compete with the United States was indirectly, or as the Chinese\nphrased it in Unrestricted Warfare, \u201cthe force moves away from the point of\nthe enemy\u2019s attack\u201d (Liang and Xiangsui 1999, Chapter 6). That is, the Chinese\nrealized that any battlefield the US military is attacking is inherently dangerous,\nso it is best to move away and avoid the attack. That does not mean however\nthat China planned to avoid competition with the United States. Instead,\nthey recommend competing in alternative dimensions in which they were\nmore likely to prove successful. Liang and Xiangsui (1999, Chapter 2) describeDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The new terror war merits additional explanation\nbecause it encapsulates the crux of China\u2019s Unrestricted Warfare, which is not\nunrestricted in the traditional sense of extremeness or boundlessness. Instead,\nit is unrestricted in an alternate sense of technology-enabled conflict brought\nto bear across multiple dimensions against a geopolitical competitor.\nThese multiple different types of competition are not intended to replace\ntraditional warfare singularly but in combination. Understanding that social\nsystems are complex entails recognizing multiple conflict dimensions \u2013 trade,\nfinance, technology-enabled terror, ecology, etc. \u2013 and considering that when\ncombined, the target may not even recognize that they are being attacked and\nwill be completely surprised by the result. Liang and Xiangsui (1999, Chapter 8)\ndescribe this indirect, all-encompassing type of attack in terms of omnidi-\nrectionality, synchrony, asymmetry, and multidimensional coordination, but\nperhaps the clearest example is provided by the South China Sea (Glaser 2015).\nChina does not have a blue-water navy like the United States has but challenges\nAmerica\u2019s traditional right of maritime passage in international waters by\nbuilding bases on previously uninhabited islands in the South China Sea.\nThese construction activities were accompanied by synchronized diplomatic\nactions claiming sovereignty over the bases, information operations outlining\nthe historical claims of China to these islands, and military intercepts of planes\nand ships that come too close in what America maintains are international\nwaters. Even though many of these claims and activities are dubious, the fact\nthat no country was willing to challenge China meant that these combined\nactions achieved their geostrategic aims and China effectively gained control\nof the South China Sea without the cost of warfare, though the competition\ncontinues (Hong 2018).\nRussia\nThe Russians, like the Chinese, developed their own way to pursue their geopo-\nlitical goals, which they call new generation warfare (B\u00aferzi\u00b8n\u0161 2014). It too is\nmultidimensional and essentially combines small, undeclared forces and infor-\nmation operations to engage geopolitical competitors in an indirect and subver-\nsive manner. The forces used by Russia consist of specially prepared irregular\nforces that attack in a combined and synchronized manner. These forces may\nassassinate opposition leaders, terrorize populations, or destroy the economic\ninfrastructure of the target without war being declared. Over time, such actions\nseem almost normal because conflict has been temporally extended to the point\nthat violence short of war becomes a permanent social feature.

The goal is to move away from\nthe traditional physical impact of war to a more affective, emotional, and men-\ntal impact. The goal is to influence asymmetrically and indirectly the decisions\nand behavior of the target population without war being declared.\nThere is no set time for the execution of these operations as the level of con-\nflict is maintained just below that of openly declared war for extended periods.\nRussia includes the additional factors of nationalist demographics, moral justi-\nfication, and legal defense in its new generation warfare, though some of these\nfactors have long histories that have been adapted to current exigencies. Rus-\nsian citizens have long been placed in regions where Russian, Soviet, or imperial\nRussian leaders have desired increased influence, such as the Baltic nations of\nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Belarus (Stali\u00afunas 2007). Violence and instabil-\nity caused through undeclared military and information operations can then\nbe cited as a reason for further Russian interference on the pretext of protect-\ning the local Russian population. Additionally, Russia seeks legal support and\njustification for its actions. Even if the arguments reduce to dubious legalism,\nthey support the special and information operations by influencing the mental\nstate and decision-making of the target population.\nRussia\u2019s new generation warfare was used to annex the Crimea in March\n2014 and influence the Ukraine afterward. Since the fall of the Soviet Union,\nRussia has been particularly sensitive to the expansion of Europe\u2019s North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) eastward. Since World War II, the\nRussians have pursued the strategic notion of depth \u2013 that is, distance between\nitself and its perceived threats. The three Baltic nations joining NATO in\n2004 were difficult for Russia to accept because it affected its depth as NATO\nwas now only 160 km from St. Petersburg instead of 1600 km (B\u00aferzi\u00b8n\u0161 2014).\nWhen the Ukraine also started to move toward NATO\u2019s orbit, this was\nseen by Russia as a red line that could not be crossed because, in Russia\u2019s\nopinion, its security requires a Ukraine that is friendly, subordinate, and\nRussified. In response, Russia annexed the Crimea through a combination\nof operations including troops that were already in place, moral reasoning\nthat they were protecting ethnic Russians and the Ukrainians themselves,\nand a hastily organized referendum in which Crimea voted to join Russia.\nThe result was that Russia annexed the Crimea, its traditional Black Sea base\nfor more than 250 years, in three weeks without a shot being fired (B\u00aferzi\u00b8n\u0161\n2014, p. 3). Additionally, Russia sent special forces into the Ukraine under\nthe pretext that they were merely intelligence officers, a new generation\nmilitary action intended to prevent the Ukraine from being influenced by\nthe west.\nThis section has concentrated on the way that America\u2019s near-peer com-\npetitors, China and Russia, have implemented asymmetric strategies to\nconfront America indirectly.

These adaptations and the reasoning behind them are developed\nfurther in the following section.\nModeling Information Operations: Representing\nComplexity\nDescribing and understanding the impacts of single military operations is\ndifficult, but analyzing the interactions of multiple operations \u2013 like the\nkinetic insurgent and non-kinetic information operations of Russia\u2019s next\ngeneration warfare \u2013 is even more difficult. For example, US Army General\nStanley McChrystal noted the counterintuitive phenomenon of insurgent\nmath in Iraq (Lemieux 2010), which occurs when 10 insurgents are removed\nfrom 100 in a region, but instead of 90 remaining insurgents, there are,\ncounterintuitively, 110. How is this possible? Counterintuitive social behaviors\nare driven by the inherent complexity of social systems (Forrester 1971), which\nin this case are driven by the combination of (i) kinetic military operations\nand (ii) non-kinetic information operations described in the previous section.\nThe relationship between these two operational phenomena is specified,\nquantified, and integrated using the SD computer modeling and simulation\nmethodology, which provides a top-down systems perspective that helps to\nenvision and understand the behavior of complex social systems. SD is a\nmature methodology (Sterman 2000) that provides a way not just to model\ncomplex dynamic systems but also to frame and create such models, which are\ndeveloped here using the Vensim SD simulation environment (Eberlein 2007).\nSD models feedback relationships using stock\u2013flow, accumulative, or\nintegrative relationships as shown in Figure 36.1, which shows an initial,\nintuitive formulation of insurgent math using Vensim. It shows a stock\u2013flow\nrelationship with the rectangle representing a stock and an outflow on the\nright that decreases the insurgent population through kinetic operations,\nwhich represents the mental model that informed McChrystal\u2019s actions. If the\nnumber of insurgents is decreased then, he wondered, how can it possibly\nincrease? What follows lays out a story of how to describe and understand\nsome complex phenomena.\nFigure 36.2 provides additional system logic that shows how the number of\ninsurgents can (depending on detail) increase despite some being removed.\nThe kinetic operations undertaken have unintended consequences, such as\ncivilian casualties, which are used by insurgents to influence the much larger\ngeneral population using the kind of cultural, religious, and identity-based\nmessages described by van Creveld (1991).

In this\nexample, 10 insurgents are removed from the battlespace through kinetic\noperations, but IO counters the insurgent messaging that falsely claims civilian\ncasualties, so only 5 new insurgents arrive to replace them, meaning that the\noriginal 100 insurgents have been reduced to 100 \u2013 10 + 5 or 95.\nFigure 36.4 asserts that using the same IO campaign as Figure 36.3 but with\nno kinetic operations and therefore no opportunity to claim civilian casualties,\nthe number of insurgents is reduced from 100 to 85. This is a speculative\nscenario that assumes a degree of success for IO that may not be achievable\nin the real world, but developing hypotheses through simulation is the kind of\nscenario-based analysis and what-if experimentation that provokes thought,\ndiscussion, additional experimentation, creativity, and operational innovation.\nThis use of computer simulation, then, is not predictive in the traditional sense,\nbut rather a vehicle for explanation and exploration as discussed in Chapter 2\nof this volume (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2018).

Figure 36.5 shows the systems\u2019 feedbacks in the form of a causal\nloop diagram (CLD) with negative or balancing loops marked with a B and\npositive or reinforcing loops with an R. The top loop, B1, is a balancing loop\nbased on the Figure 36.3 model, in which the insurgent population causes\nmore kinetic operations, which in turn increases insurgent outflow, thereby\nreducing the insurgent population. Note that the positive signs next to the\ncausal arrows denote change in the same direction, while negative signs denote\nchange in the opposite direction. Continuing with the story, the insurgents,\nrecognizing this, respond with an influence campaign that results in the R\nfeedback loop that works against McChrystal\u2019s kinetic operations by increasing\nthe insurgent population. The IO campaign (previously shown in Figure 36.3)\ncreates the B2 feedback loop, in Figure 36.5, which supports kinetic operations\nand counters insurgent influence. These analytic insights are extended in the\nfollowing section.\nModeling Gray Zone Operations: Extending Analytic\nCapability\nThis study argues that conflict has fundamentally changed in the twenty-first\ncentury as America\u2019s competitors have employed insurgent-style strategies and\ntactics to offset and counter US technical innovations. What is less clear is how\nthe United States and its allies should respond to these new capabilities and\nbehaviors. This process starts with the analytic tasks associated with making\nsense of these challenges.\nFigure 36.6 depicts a gray zone that exists between peace and war that\nembodies elements of each.

While,\ntraditionally, there has been a desire for speed and decision in the execution of\nwarfare (von Clausewitz 1873), gray zone conflict instead pursues a temporal\nextension or gradualism that achieves the benefits of war without the costs\n(Mazarr 2015). That is, if a country does not even recognize (or, more precisely,\ndoes not appreciate the extent to which) it is being attacked, and no single\naction is provocative enough to warrant a response, then national interests\nthat traditionally have required war can be pursued short of war. The art of\nthis process comes in planning and executing a campaign that is sufficiently\ngradual and effective (B\u00aferzi\u00b8n\u0161 2014).\nThe question then becomes, how can an analyst connect and comprehend\nthe many small, seemingly disparate events that combine to achieve a gray zone\noperation? The SD models described in the previous section provide a starting\npoint because the separate influences associated in a gray zone campaign can be\nspecified and sometimes quantified and integrated within a coherent computer\nsimulation. The SD models also highlight analytic gaps that point the way to\nadditional information requirements and modeling capabilities. One of the key\ngaps is how to identify, connect, and contextualize individual events to com-\nprehend how they contribute collectively to gray zone campaigns.\nSD simulations capture three key aspects of causal complexity: (i) stock\u2013flow\n(accumulative and integrative) relationships, (ii) nonlinear relationships, and\n(iii) feedback relationships, both reinforcing (positive) and balancing (nega-\ntive). SD achieves this analytic capability through the abstraction of the stock,\nwhich represents simply a much more complex underlying reality. As shown in\nFigure 36.7, an SD stock, as depicted by a rectangle, represents an idealized col-\nlection of identical things, while in the real world, a stock is a messy collection\nof somewhat similar things.\nFigure 36.7 System\ndynamics (SD) stocks and\nflows can be disaggregated\ninto distributed dynamic\nnetworks.\nNetwork\nInflow Outflow\nSystem dynamics (SD) stocks and flows\nDistributed dynamic networksDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A rich literature has\nbuilt up regarding the analysis networks, and much is known about them,\nbut they tend to be unchanging and static, while the networks required to\nunderstand how individual events contribute to gray zone campaigns would\nneed to be flexible and dynamic. Therefore, work needs to be done to develop\nmodeling and simulation techniques that further the capabilities of dynamic\nnetworks.\nFigure 36.7 shows notionally how the stock and flow abstraction of a\ntop-down SD simulation can be disaggregated into a bottom-up dynamic\nnetwork. Dynamic complexity is introduced because incoming nodes must\nbe attached somewhere specific within the network, while outgoing nodes\nmust be removed from somewhere, a process that is much simplified by the\nstock and flow SD abstraction. The networked structure supports the type of\nopposition adaptation that is characteristic of the gray zone:\nWhat distinguishes netwar as a form of conflict is the networked organi-\nzational structure of its practitioners\u2014with many groups actually being\nleaderless\u2014and the suppleness in their ability to come together quickly\nin swarming attacks.\n(Arquilla and Ronfeldt 2001, p. xi)\nCombining and reconciling the aggregate dynamics of top-down SD models\nwith the specificity of bottom-up network models remains an ongoing goal of\ngray zone modeling and analysis research.\nAdditionally, network representations allow for the visual representation\nof space, which is vital for military commanders who need to know what\nhappens where. Computer-based geographic information systems (GISs)\nprovide an intuitive way to visualize space through the mapping of network\nnodes, individually or in groups, to specific GIS regions or coverages as shown\nin Figure 36.8.\nCombining maps and models that represent both space and time is an\nactive research area that can potentially benefit gray zone and related analysis\n(NASEM 2016).\nConclusion\nThis study has focused on how technology has transformed twenty-first-\ncentury warfare in ways that are unexpected, surprising, and counterintuitive.\nThere has long been a belief that war is fought primarily by nation-statesDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

However, as van Creveld (1991)\npredicted a quarter century ago that conflict would transform in fundamental\nways. The first Gulf War seemed to confirm the view of traditional war,\nwhich was fought decisively by armies in uniform. China and Russia however\ntook note of how futile it was to fight the United States directly on the\nbattlefield and instead chose to compete with America indirectly, especially\nwith gradual information and military operations that combine to form a\ngray zone, something between war and peace. As an example of how this\nindirect, twenty-first-century way of warfare, an SD computer simulation of\nStanley McChrystal\u2019s insurgent math was created and explained showing how\nremoving 10 insurgents from a group of 100 can counterintuitively result in\n110 through information operations. Finally, the American response to gray\nzone operations was examined with an emphasis on analytic innovations that\naddress the gradualism, particularism, and spatiality of information and gray\nzone operations.\nThese issues and observations are informed by a singular methodological\ninsight \u2013 that social systems, including the international system and its\nattendant geopolitical conflicts, are complex, which results in their character-\nistically surprising, unpredictable, and counterintuitive behaviors (Forrester\n1971). Computer-based modeling and simulation techniques, such as the\nSD example developed herein, can be used to account for and address the\nchallenges associated with analyzing complex social systems. While such\ntechniques are well known in the academy (Sterman 2000), they have not\ntransitioned to the operational or policy communities as much as some might\nhave initially anticipated. However, the emerging realities and challenges of\npervasive technology have caused the late Stephen Hawking, among others, to\npredict the twenty-first century \u201cwill be the century of complexity\u201d (West 2017,\np. 20). As technology causes war to transform and the international system\nto evolve, its behavior will become ever harder to analyze and comprehend.\nComputer-based modeling and simulation techniques will prove increasingly\nnecessary to understand these systems and the drivers underlying their\ndynamics. Several technical innovations have been suggested here to make\nthese tools and techniques more applicable to the analysis of these systems\nand more potent in the formulation of policies to influence, shape, and\nmaintain them.\nThis chapter has discussed a military problem that illustrates the complexity\nof social and behavioral systems that can be addressed through modeling and\nsimulation. It has also illustrated important functions of SD simulation that\nextend beyond prediction \u2013 that is, the function of diagnosing, describing, and\nexplaining complex social and behavioral phenomena as well as exploring the\npotential consequences of changes in strategy (akin to interventions in other\nexamples). Methods for doing so include using visual languages for comprehen-\nsibility, using multiple formalisms (in this case both SD and network modeling),\nusing GISs, and addressing issues at different resolutions.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Numerous studies, reports, theses, and papers\ndescribe the battle of narratives or battle for the narrative and decry the fact\nthat the United States has been losing that battle, or, worse, losing by default\nby failing to contest the narrative battlespace. 1 Enthusiasts point out that\nnarratives are foundational to justification, legitimacy, public opinion, and\neffective influence (Nissen 2012). Further, legitimacy and public perceptions\nare essential to success in operations. The strongest statement of this view\nasserts that \u201cit will not be the military implementation that will determine\nthe success or failure of the present-day campaign. The side with the most\ncompelling narrative will succeed\u201d (Crannel and Sheppard 2010).\nThis chapter presents lessons learned from a study conducted for the US\nMarine Corps to understand what operational commands can and should\ntry to accomplish with narratives and identifies implications for representing\nnarratives effectively in modeling. It provides an overview of current thinking\non the nature of narratives and how they might be better included in military\noperations. This operational focus raises issues that should be taken seriously\nby those concerned with social-behavioral science and its modeling. The\nchapter highlights several important questions that frame challenges to\neffective modeling of narrative:\n1 Portions of this discussion are drawn from C. Paul, K.S. Colley, and L.

Can they then take countermeasures?\nRelated matters are discussed elsewhere in this volume (Corman et al. 2019;\nDavis and O\u2019Mahony 2019; Yilmaz 2019), but current social-behavioral model-\ning is a long way from being able to deal with these challenges.\nWhat Are Narratives?\nDespite the constant refrain of the importance of narratives and the repeated\ndemand that we become better at fighting against, with, or through narratives,\nthere is alarmingly little agreement about how exactly to do that or even exactly\nwhat a narrative is. This lack of consensus constitutes one of the first challenges\nfor modeling and simulation: what, exactly, should we be trying to model? One\nprominent scholar notes that while there is a substantial amount of existing\ntheory on narratives, \u201cthis body of literature is poorly organized\u201d (Corman\n2011). Another notes that the \u201cdiscussion of stories and narratives is hampered\nby the fact that there is no widely accepted definition regarding just what a story\nis\u201d (Casebeer and Russell 2005). Concerningly, this confusion leads the term\nnarrative to be conflated with message or theme, which are indeed related to\nnarratives but lack the depth, complexity, and relation to context of narratives.2\nModeling and simulation of narrative must go beyond more simplistic efforts\nto model communication and messaging, though that might be a place to start.\nDifferent views of what narratives are and should be are real and consequen-\ntial, not a mere matter of semantics. My attempt to synthesize the existing\ndiscussion suggests consensus on three matters, which are essential to explain-\ning narratives and understanding why they are important to operations: First,\nthey are about stories and have story properties (settings, characters, plots, res-\nolutions, beginnings, middles, and ends). Second, stories are how human beings\n2 The Joint Staff J7 has released guidance for CommSync, explicitly stating the differences\nbetween narratives, themes, and messages. Whereas a narrative focuses on \u201ccontext, reason, and\ndesired results [and] \u2026 enables understanding for external stakeholders,\u201d messages are \u201cnarrowly\nfocused communications that support a specific theme \u2026 to create a specific effect.\u201d Also see\nDepartment of Defense (2013).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

And third, the\nstories that get told about the events of military operations and conflicts affect\nperceptions and understandings of those operations, which in turn affect the\nperceived legitimacy of those operations and the extent to which one side or\nthe other receives an individual or group\u2019s support. Remember one man\u2019s rebel\nis another man\u2019s freedom fighter . . . .\nBecause narratives affect perceptions, and perceptions ultimately affect deci-\nsions and actions, there is a role for narrative in live, virtual, or constructive\n(LVC) simulations of military operations that model or wish to include the atti-\ntudes and behaviors of enemy forces and so-called \u201cgreen\u201d forces and actors,\nsuch as civilians, noncombatants, and others whose behavior might affect the\nprogress or outcomes of operations.\nWhat Is Important About Narratives?\nWhat about narratives do commanders, planners, and operators need to under-\nstand? Relatedly, what aspects of narrative are important to capture in modeling\nand simulation for training or exercises? I want to highlight three facts about\nnarratives because they are particularly relevant to thinking about (or simulat-\ning) narratives in the defense context:\n\u2022 People use narratives to make sense of the world and their place in it.\n\u2022 Compelling narratives have consistency, familiarity, and proof.\n\u2022 Narratives already exist, and although they can be shaped over time, they\ncannot always be changed or replaced.\nEach of these three points is explained below.\nPeople Use Narratives to Make Sense of the World\nNarratives and other mental shortcuts help humans make sense of the things\nwe see and experience in the world. Research shows that people use stories to\nhelp structure memory, cue certain approaches to problem-solving, format new\ninformation, and define our identities (Narvaez 1998; San Roque et al. 2012).\nNarratives also often suggest or hint at how we should feel about an event based\non the emotional content of the narrative or even imply a value judgment or\nsuggest a course of action, perhaps based on the moral of the story. \u201cNarratives\nmake sense of the world, put things in their place according to our experience,\nand then tell us what to do\u201d (Laity 2015).\nPart of making sense of the world is making sense of our place in it. When\nexposed to compelling narratives, we subconsciously identify with the actors\nand struggles explained in them. When we relate to the characters or their\nstruggle, we use the outcomes in the narrative to give us purpose or suggest\ncourses of action. For example, many US military recruiting commercials tellDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

ISIS similarly offers opportunities for recruits\nto protect the \u201cpersecuted\u201d and for young men to be a part of an organization\nnot afraid to act in the face of \u201coppression,\u201d but in their stories, they use\ncharacters, struggles, and goals chosen to resonate with their target audiences.\nIn both cases, potential recruits can identify personally and emotionally and\nsee a path of action to address key events in their worldviews; thus, narratives\ncan be both explanatory and mobilizing.\nWhat happens when we cannot make sense of events witnessed or accounts\nheard? The human brain wants the information it receives to make sense.\nWhen the brain cannot make sense out of incoming information, that infor-\nmation is more likely to be discounted or ignored or recombined with previous\ninformation until it does make sense (Seese and Haven 2015). So, if something\nnew happens (say, the arrival of US troops to provide humanitarian aid), it\nis interpreted based on the existing stories or overarching narratives held by\nthe observing audience or individual. If the dominant existing narrative about\nAmerican troops is negative (they are villains and only come to hurt, belittle,\nand occupy us), then the new facts will predominantly be interpreted in a\nway that is consistent with that narrative, even if this requires the omission of\nsome of the details (the part about the humanitarian aid, perhaps?), leaving\nthe audience with a negative view.\nThese narrative-based perspectives are referred to in the academic litera-\nture as narrative frames.3 Such frames are not necessarily derived from a single\nstory but from an audience\u2019s whole collection of stories, created and transmit-\nted within societies over time. These narrative frames (or lenses) shade how\nwe view the world and help with our sensemaking. For example, the Marine\nCorps has a number of memorable and important specific narratives, such as\nthose relating to Tripoli, Chesty Puller, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima. However,\nthere is also a Marine Corps narrative frame, a way of seeing the world and the\nMarines\u2019 role in it, so that it is consistent with all of those stories and is more\nor less shared by all Marines.\nThis is true of other peoples as well. Narratives and narrative frames will\nvary widely in different cultural contexts, because different groups of people\nhave different collections of stories. This is important because different groups\nof people will perceive the same events differently, and make different sense\nof them, based on their different narrative frames. Just because our narrative\nframe suggests events be interpreted in a certain way does not mean that frame,\nperspective, and interpretation are shared by other audiences.\n3 For more on frames and framing, see Goffman (1974) and Benford and Shaw (2000). A similar\nconcept is called schemas in cognitive psychology (McVeee et al. 2005).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Narrative frames are not strictly and objectively rational. Different\ngroups in a simulation need to be allowed to perceive and interpret events,\nactions, and messages differently, depending on the mobilized narratives and\ntheir narrative frames.\nCompelling Narratives Have Consistency, Familiarity, and Proof\nCompelling narratives have at least three characteristics: consistency, familiar-\nity, and proof (Case and Mellen 2009). Consistency refers both to the internal\nconsistency of a story (e.g. whether the outcome follows logically from the\naction described and whether the characters\u2019 behavior is true to type) and to the\nstory\u2019s consistency with other salient narratives or narrative frames. Familiar-\nity is about how well known a story or narrative is; more than just awareness of\nthe story, familiarity also implies a level of comfort with the story, which could\ncome from sharing themes in common with stories within a broader narrative\nframe. Proof is about the evidence available in support of the narrative and can\nvary widely. Proof can hinge on the perceived credibility of what is claimed,\nperceived credibility of the narrator, eyewitness accounts, or recorded pictures\nor video. Note that what constitutes proof varies considerably by context and\nmedium. For example, in the United States, the facts in stories presented by\ntelevision news anchors are accorded high degrees of credibility and generally\naccepted as strong proof. Elsewhere in the world, however, state-run television\nnews reports are not considered much proof at all, while a story repeated from\na friend of a friend might count as strong proof, despite less compelling evi-\ndence. Presumably these three attributes (consistency, familiarity, and proof )\ncan be scored and scaled as part of a model, though the attributes of a given\nnarrative will likely differ for different groups (and that will be important to\nmodel, too).\nNarratives Already Exist and Cannot Always Be Changed or Replaced\nAs much as different audiences will ascribe different levels of consistency, famil-\niarity, and proof to different narratives, different audiences also have a different\ncollection of stories and narratives available to them and prefer to interpret\nnew events in a way that is consistent with their existing collection of stories.\nBecause of the substantial body of preexisting stories available to any audience,\nmost events they witness or experience immediately fit within, and sensemak-\ning is supported by at least one of those preexisting narratives. \u201cAudiences will\nwithout exception always interpret stories in their terms\u201d (Zalman 2010). This\ncan make it very difficult to present a new or alternative narrative that will have\ntraction.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

So, if preexisting narratives\ndrive the understanding of events in most cases, when and how can US forces\noppose, counter, or offer alternatives to those narratives? More briefly, when\nare there narrative opportunities, and what kinds of opportunities are they?\nWhen something happens that people notice and care about, relevant audi-\nences will become aware of it and try to make sense of it. In any given instance,\none of three things will happen:\n1. The event fits perfectly within one existing narrative, reinforcing that narra-\ntive and connecting to all the other content (negative or positive) from that\nnarrative. That narrative becomes the dominant narrative for this event.\n2. The event fits reasonably well within more than one available narrative or\ncan be viewed through the lens of more than one relevant narrative frame.\nThe event will be understood through one or more of the available nar-\nrative frames, but which one(s) will be dominant is unclear (and perhaps\nshapeable).\n3. The event does not fit well within available narratives or mobilized narrative\nframes. The event will end up connected to one or more narratives (perhaps\nnew, perhaps old) and viewed through narrative frames, but which ones and\nhow it will be interpreted is an open question.\nEach of these three possibilities corresponds to a different level of narra-\ntive opportunity. These three levels of opportunity will need to be captured in\nefforts to model potential friendly force impact on narratives in models:\n1. If the event fits perfectly within an existing mobilized narrative, there is\nvery limited narrative opportunity, leaving very few options. These include\n(i) accepting and embracing all or part of that narrative (if it is positive or\nhas positive or at least tolerable aspects), (ii) adjusting planned actions so\nthat they are not so easily connected to that narrative (if the planned action\nis going to connect directly to an unfavorable narrative, consider not doing\nthat action, or finding a way to do it that will be perceived and framed dif-\nferently), or (iii) trying to emphasize aspects of the action that suggest an\nalternative narrative frame (basically try to make a situation #1 into a situa-\ntion #2). Just to emphasize, sometimes the only way to create an opportunity\nto change the narrative is to change the actions.\n2. If events fit reasonably well within one or more alternative narratives or\nframes, there is some narrative opportunity. Those trying to fight with,\nthrough, and against narratives can pick the available narratives that are\nmost favorable or beneficial to the joint force and try to emphasize aspects\nof the action that are consistent with those narratives or otherwise try toDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Provided there is an alternative\nnarrative, there might be an opportunity to emphasize how the event\nis not like what happens in an unfavorable narrative. Note this is not a\nsufficiently wide-open opportunity to make up a wholly new narrative, just\nan opportunity to push toward and emphasize favorable available narratives\nand perhaps push away from unfavorable narratives.\n3. If the event is something new or different, people are still going to try to\nunderstand it and connect it to existing frames, but there may be greater\nopportunity to shape which ones are adopted or to introduce new ones.\n\u201cSince narratives are neither fixed nor infinitely malleable, each side has\na window of opportunity in which it may choose to change its narrative\nin order to address changing circumstances effectively\u201d (Case and Mellen\n2009, p. 1). Here, narrative opportunity is greatest, as a much wider range of\navailable narratives or narrative frames can potentially be mobilized to help\nobservers understand the event. It may even be possible to promote a wholly\nnew narrative; however, it would be easier, and would likely have more trac-\ntion, to try to mobilize some dormant preexisting narrative or lens than to\ncreate a wholly new one. A dormant narrative is more likely to be consistent\nand somewhat familiar, whereas a wholly new narrative, even if there is an\nopportunity for one, will need to build its consistency, familiarity, and proof\nfrom scratch.\nWhen comparing competing narratives or narrative frames, audiences con-\nsider and weigh the consistency, familiarity, and proof of each. This subcon-\nscious or conscious comparison of competing narratives operates following\ncognitive processes not unlike those used by a jury during deliberations (Case\nand Mellen 2009).\nOnce a given narrative or narrative frame has been associated with an event\nor series of events, it will be difficult to change that connection. However, there\nmay be opportunities to emphasize different aspects of that narrative, to try to\ncombine it with another salient narrative with more favorable characteristics,\nor to otherwise shape the narrative. Again, in most situations, a wholly new\nnarrative is unlikely to gain much traction because \u2013 as compared with other\navailable narratives \u2013 it will lack external consistency and will be unfamiliar,\nregardless how much proof is associated with it (especially if that proof is more\ncompelling to Western audiences than to relevant audiences).\nThe degree of narrative opportunity available in a given situation will be crit-\nical to capture in efforts to add narrative to modeling and simulation. The suc-\ncess of efforts to shape or change narratives should be heavily influenced by the\ndegree of narrative opportunity identified in the simulation. Simulations should\nnot allow success in positively influencing perceptions if the actions naively\nattempt to propagate a narrative when there is no opening in the (simulated)\nnarrative opportunity space!Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

These narratives must nest with higher-level narratives\nin the same way that subordinate objectives and goals must nest with goals,\nobjectives, and end states prescribed at higher levels.5\nSo, what should commands hope to accomplish with narratives in support\nof military operations? Which of these things can be captured in modeling\nand simulation? First is internal coordination. If humans make sense of events\nthrough narrative, then a clear mission narrative will be useful for the troops.\nSuch a narrative needs to fit with existing military and service-specific narra-\ntive frames (avoid a narrative that tries to make the Marine Corps feel like the\nPeace Corps), but done right, a mission narrative makes it easier for everyone\nto understand and remember mission objectives and to understand their role in\nthe story that will lead to achievement of those objectives. A clear mission nar-\nrative can help troops avoid the \u201csay-do gap\u201d that often opens between actions\nand communications; it can promote unity of effort and diminish the likelihood\nof information fratricide. A good mission narrative guides follow-on planning,\ntargeting, and execution and enables mission command because subordinates\nwill be better able to judge whether an available course of action is consistent\nwith the narrative and thus preferred. In many simulations, the problems that\ninternal narrative helps reduce are not modeled. If they would be, then it should\nbe trivial to add modeling of the consequences of internal narrative.\nSecond, commands can use narrative to offer a positive or alternative expla-\nnation to external audiences. Relevant audiences are going to find narratives\nand narrative frames to help them make sense of US operations. Left to rely\nsolely on their own histories and experiences, many of these narratives will\nsupport views and actions that are contrary to US operations. Countering\nthese existing perceptions is a core challenge of narrative in operations.\nCommands should seek to promote narratives of their operations that ascribe\npositive meanings to their actions so that they add up to something that\nshould be supported, or at least patiently tolerated, rather than being viewed\n4 See, for example, the criticisms discussed in Weitz (2008), Haddick (2012), and Zelleke and\nZorn (2014).\n5 Ideally, the President or National Security Staff provide the DoD with strategic-level guidance\nthat includes the strategic narrative. In the event the narrative is not provided or unclear, JDN\n2-13 (2013) suggests several ways to extract the strategic narrative from other high-level\ndocuments.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The extent to which this is possible will be constrained by the level\nof narrative opportunity available, as described in the previous section. Done\nwell, promotion of a favorable narrative increases understanding of, tolerance\nof, and support for US operations. This increased tolerance can increase the\nlikelihood of desired behaviors (noninterference, cooperation, etc.) and can\nalso increase freedom of maneuver because US force actions occur within the\nconfines of a locally accepted narrative of legitimacy.\nThird, the command may want to compete with or undermine narratives at\nodds with mission objectives, when there is sufficient narrative opportunity\nto do so. Many operating environments may contain narratives or narrative\nframes that do not support US force presence or objectives, or such narratives\nmay be introduced or mobilized by adversarial groups whose interests do not\nalign with those of the United States. In order to reap the benefits of having a\nbroadly accepted legitimating narrative and achieve desired levels of support,\nUS forces may need to find a way to \u201cdefeat\u201d these alternative narratives. There\nis a growing body of literature on ways to attack narratives head on, but that is\noutside the scope of this chapter.6\nDefeating hostile narratives must go hand in hand with the promotion of pos-\nitive narratives. Audiences will find a narrative or narrative frame for events,\nand they will make sense of them, one way or another. It is impossible to defeat\na narrative and just leave a narrative vacuum. There must be an alternative nar-\nrative that replaces it. \u201cThe one thing that replaces [or modifies] a story-based\nbelief \u2026 is a better story\u201d (Seese and Haven 2015).\nThe second and third uses, offering positive narratives and attempting to\ncompete with or undermine disadvantageous narratives, are at the core of the\nchallenge of including narrative in modeling and simulation for training and\nexercises. Simulations supporting these levels need to model narrative \u201cplay,\u201d\nwhich is predicated on modeling the structure of available narratives (mobi-\nlized and dormant), consequences when actions correspond to an unfavorable\nnarrative, probability of success when there is an effort to connect events to one\nnarrative over another, the slow strengthening or weakening of narratives with\ncertain audiences through contradiction or supporting evidence, and every-\nthing else necessary to simulate a realistic and dynamic narrative context.\nMoving Forward in Fighting Against, with, and Through\nNarrative in Support of Operations\nThree Kinds of Narrative\nWith these three objectives \u2013 internal coordination, offering a positive narra-\ntive, and competing with opposing narratives \u2013 in mind, how can US forces\ngo about this in training and in practice? I see three kinds of narratives that\n6 For instance, see Cobb (2016).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Making progress toward successful employ-\nment of these narratives can follow a crawl, walk, run progression. Beneficial\nmodeling and simulation support required differs slightly at each of these\nlevels.\nThinking at all about narrative is at the crawl level, as is preparing and dissem-\ninating an internal mission narrative for internal coordination. Modeling and\nsimulation to support crawl is pretty minimal: the inclusion of even minimal\nincentive or opportunity within the context of a simulation to draw users\u2019 atten-\ntion to narrative, space or an input field that accepts an internal mission narra-\ntive as an input (even if that input does not actually affect the model), including\ninformation on narrative as part of the discoverable information within a sim-\nulated scenario, etc.\nIdentifying how the command\u2019s actions are likely to be perceived by external\naudiences and building an external narrative to project alongside those actions\nis at the walk level, as it requires some knowledge of relevant populations and\ntheir narrative frames. Supporting the walk level requires a great deal more\nfrom modeling and simulation. Models most include actual consequences from\nvarious groups/actors/agents\u2019 perceptions of the user\u2019s forces\u2019 actions, as well as\nbeing connected to discoverable context \u2013 models need to produce (potentially)\ndifferent perception-driven results for different actions (or different approaches\nto very similar actions), and must do so in a way that is at least partially discov-\nerable and dependent on characteristics of simulated groups. The requirement\nfor discoverability is also part of the modeling and simulation challenge. Even\nif a simulation engine is realistically capturing the available narratives, changes\nto those narratives, and the consequences of those narratives, that information\ncannot be presented unfiltered to users. The narrative landscape is beset by a\nfog of war problem far out of scale with traditional battlefield uncertainty. Real-\nistically presenting situational awareness of narrative (and of the information\nenvironment more broadly) is a huge and important challenge for successful\nmodeling and simulation in this area (McGrath 2016).\nUnderstanding the nuance of available and likely narratives and narrative\nframes and planning ways to get external audiences to talk (narrate) favorably\nabout the command is more challenging still and on the way to (or part of ) the\nrun level. Supporting the run level will place a significant burden on modeling\nand simulation, necessitating nuanced cultural models; models for how narra-\ntives are mobilized and matched to unfolding events; even more sophisticated\nmodeling of narrative situational awareness; models for how narratives change\nover time and under pressure; and models for things that are very difficult to\nreliably predict, such as what message will go viral (and when) and which stories\nor explanations will prove to be sticky and which will not.7\n7 See, for example, Heath and Heath (2007).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

I think that the same process that produces the comman-\nder\u2019s intent could produce the command\u2019s mission narrative with very slight\nadjustment. Some extra thinking may be required to transform some language\nto better portray a story in which the troops of the command are among the\ncharacters and the essential tasks are their actions. As a staff concludes mission\nanalysis and prepares the commander\u2019s guidance and intent, they should also\nprepare the mission narrative as part of that intent. Ultimately, the mission\nnarrative is just a restatement of the commander\u2019s desired end state as the\nconclusion of a story and the role the commander expects troops to play in\nbringing that end state about: it captures the essence of the why and the how\nof the mission as envisioned by the commander.\nAn example of an excellent summary phrase for a command\u2019s mission narra-\ntive is \u201cNo better friend, no worse enemy\u201d as used by then MGen James Mattis\nwith First Marine Division beginning with commencement of Operation Iraqi\nFreedom I in March of 2003 (Mattis 2003). This headline captured two facets\nof his intent: that his Marines be aggressive and flexible in taking the fight to\nthe enemy, but that civilians and prisoners be treated with chivalry and spared\nunnecessary harm. It gave clear roles to his Marines \u2013 the best of friends, the\nworst of enemies. It tied into the existing Marine Corps narrative frame, with\nthe same narratives that confirm \u201cevery Marine a rifleman\u201d being highly con-\nsistent with the \u201cno worse enemy\u201d portion. When he returned to Iraq in 2004\nfor OIF II, he kept \u201cno better friend, no worse enemy\u201d but also added \u201cfirst, do\nno harm\u201d in order to emphasize the relief and reconstruction emphasis of the\nnew mission (Mattis 2004).\nNot every command\u2019s mission narrative will be as straightforward and short\nas Mattis\u2019 masterpiece, but every such narrative should connect with the nar-\nrative frames and identities of the troops addressed, describe the roles those\ntroops will play as the operation unfolds, and state the desired conclusion of\nthe story of the operation. As noted above, the kinds of problems that inter-\nnal narratives solve or prevent are often not problematized in simulation and\nare probably not a priority for simulation. Just allowing internal narratives as an\ninput without tying it to any consequences in the simulation engine may be suf-\nficient for most training and exercise contexts. Or, if a simulation includes the\npossibility of information fratricide or disjoint actions by friendly forces, then\ninternal narratives could be scored and modeled as reducing the likelihood of\nsuch unfortunate events.\nDeveloping a Command\u2019s External Narrative\nDeveloping a narrative to try to impart to external audiences is much more\nchallenging (and requires much more sophistication to sufficiently simulate).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It is much more effective to offer the same story of\njustification, explanation, and purpose to the troops executing the mission and\nto the audiences witnessing that execution. Unfortunately, a quick and easy\nnarrative that resonates with US troops because it connects to their existing\nnarrative lenses and identities may fall flat with relevant foreign audiences\nbecause it is inconsistent with their preexisting narratives, is unfamiliar to\nthem, and lacks proof that they find compelling.\nDeveloping a command\u2019s external narrative necessitates work and effort not\ncurrently part of operational planning routines and modeling content not cur-\nrently available in existing LVC training and exercises. Preparing a command\u2019s\nexternal narrative requires a fairly robust understanding of the relevant audi-\nences (those people whose behavior is instrumental to the success or failure of\nthe campaign); their narrative frames in terms of their history, worldview, and\nrecent events; and the available narratives about the United States, US forces,\nand their operations and actions. To be able to plan effectively for a command\u2019s\nexternal narrative, intelligence preparation of the information and operating\nenvironment must include attention to these kinds of issues, as must the sim-\nulation of this intelligence preparation and simulation of situational awareness\nmore broadly. This preparation may require (or benefit from) media and social\nmedia monitoring or available behavioral, cultural, and linguistic subject matter\nexperts who have sufficient knowledge of the operational context to meet the\nneed and the kinds of information gathered as part of target audience analysis\nas conducted by military information support operations (MISO) personnel. To\nsimulate preparation of a command\u2019s internal narrative and model its impact,\nthose same kinds of things will need to be included in modeling and simulation\nand made part of the scenario context and simulated discoverable information.\nDeveloping and Promoting Desired Narratives Among Relevant\nAudiences\nThe story that US forces tell about what they are doing is important, but what\nis even more important is the stories relevant local groups tell each other and\nthemselves about what US forces are doing and about what US adversaries\nare doing. The high art of fighting with, through, and against narratives at the\nrun level involves getting external narrators to tell and repeat favorable stories\nabout US forces and reducing the prevalence of narratives favorable to adver-\nsaries.\nIf the command\u2019s external narrative is perfect, then it will be adopted by\nrelevant audiences as the prevailing narrative. However, while that level of\nperfection is an aspirational goal, it may be only partially achievable due to\nnumerous variables in the battlespace that are beyond the command\u2019s control.\nMore likely, the command\u2019s external narrative is heard and becomes part of theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Doing so requires\nboth additional understanding and additional capability. Shaping and fighting\nnarratives at this level requires even more extensive cultural and linguistic\ninputs; deeper understanding of available myths, memes, and other narrative\nelements; intelligence about key influencers; capabilities for persuasion and\ninfluence (like MISO); and better understanding of the cultural and cognitive\naspects of narrative generation and promulgation. To use modeling and\nsimulation to train and exercise at this level will require inclusion of all of\nthese things as meaningful simulation elements. In some cases, that will\nbe particularly difficult, as the necessary social science foundation is still\nbeing built. Further, shaping narratives is often a slow process. Realistically\nmatching changes in narratives to a simulation/exercise time scale is yet\nanother challenge to modeling and simulation in this area (McGrath 2016).\nConclusion: Seek Modeling and Simulation\nImprovements That Will Enable Training and Experience\nwith Narrative\nIn conclusion, I join the chorus and exhort US military formations to increase\ntheir efforts beyond messaging and improve their ability to fight with, through,\nand against narratives. I also exhort the modeling and simulation community\nto work to include relevant aspects of narrative (and other aspects of the infor-\nmation environment and information effects) in their efforts.\nAs described above, in order to begin moving on the crawl, walk, run progres-\nsion toward being able to fight effectively within narrative terrain, US forces\nneed to be able to do the following five things. In order to train and practice\nthese tasks, modeling and simulation will need to be able to allow and reflect\nthe consequences of users\u2019 efforts to:\n1. Identify available salient narratives and narrative frames already present in\nthe operating context.\n2. Anticipate which of those narratives are likely to be connected to planned\nUS actions and undertakings.\n3. Identify which narratives or aspects of narratives are favorable or neutral to\nUS objectives and which are unfavorable.\n4. Recognize when altering planned actions can create opportunities for more\nfavorable narratives.\n5.

Because\ntheir work is centrally about facilitating the social good, the government has at\nits disposal a range of techniques for influencing behavior that includes harder\n(more coercive measures) such as mandates and legislation. Consider the case\nof how to reduce deaths in car crashes. On the one end, a speed limit sign is a\nnudge, while an expensive ticket is more of a shove. Beyond that, the ability to\nrevoke someone\u2019s license or imprison them for repeated violations is more coer-\ncive a technique for getting people to conform to recommended speed limits.\nIn marketing, the driving rationale for understanding human behavior is to\nfurther such business goals as brand loyalty, profits, engagement, and other\nindicators of business health and growth. Whether the aim is to attract new\ncustomers, increase purchase frequency, shut out competition, or change\nthe way people think about a category of products/services, marketers turn\nto a range of soft power techniques including encouragement, enticement\n1 In both government and marketing contexts, major issues arise when contemplating influence\nbecause similar methods can be used for good and bad purposes. Marketing promotes commerce,\nwhich is generally considered good, but not when it entices youth to become nicotine addicts.\nGovernment influence is good when it promotes participation in elections or awareness of health\nissues when shopping at the supermarket, but countries such as the United States reject excessive\ngovernment intrusion and demand integrity rather than propaganda in government\ncommunications. In this chapter, I focus on positive forms of influence, although mentioning with\nsome alarm instances where serious issues of ethics and privacy can arise where abuse has\noccurred.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Absent the ability to force conformity\ntoward specific ends, marketers must have a nuanced understanding of what\ndrives behavior, what will inspire changes, where and when to efficiently and\neffectively communicate these messages, and who has the ability to influence\nothers within a community.\nToo often, government officials resort to the harder techniques when their\nunderstanding of the underlying behaviors is insufficient to compel adherence\nthrough softer approaches. Consider the situation of childhood immunizations.\nUnable to create effective policies that address the diverse reasons that parents\nfail to immunize their children, states are increasingly resorting to more\ndraconian tactics that tie school attendance to mandatory immunizations in all\ncases, save for a very limited number of extreme medical exemptions. While\nthese policies are effective in boosting coverage rates, they accomplish this\nthrough force (e.g. the refusal to admit a child to school), rather than through\npartnership, increased understanding, or increased access. The consequence\nis often a greater disdain for the role of government, rather than a sense of\npartnership and participation with elected officials. To this end, there is much\nthe government leaders can learn from the efforts of those in marketing and\nbusiness as it considers why people do what they do and how to get them to\ndo something different. While officials have those heavy-handed options, it\nis often in their best interests to take more subtle approaches to facilitating\nalignment with the social good.\nThis chapter presents three efforts that I led within a marketing and design\nactivity in private enterprise, highlighting a different way to think about\nmotivation, behavior, and societal change that may be of particular use for\npolicy practitioners whose job is to shape social welfare. My team and I sought\nto overcome two common biases in marketing that we believed limited the\neffectiveness of work. First, in usual studies, people are typically positioned as\nindividuals, divorced from the wider contexts that shape their lives. Second,\nthere is a tendency to dismiss the integrated way in which people live, by\nlooking at actions solely within one category (e.g. health and wellness) while\nignoring how these choices are linked across other categories (e.g. money and\nfinances).Working with my team in marketing, we drew from the very social\nsciences of anthropology and sociology, which posit motivation as being not\njust \u201cin one\u2019s head\u201d but entangled in relationships and shaped through wider\nstructural and cultural dynamics (Shore 1996). Within this framework, we\ndeveloped a three-step research process to gather ever-nuanced details about\nwhy people do what they do. As part of these efforts, we sought out creative\nways to integrate qualitative and quantitative approaches to human behavior\nas a social act. Certainly, these are not the only techniques used in marketing,\nbut they constitute a range of ways to integrate theory, qualitative data, and\nquantitative data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of behavior\nand behavior change.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Just as these are not\nequally relevant or efficacious for every marketing challenge, they will likely\nhave limits in their policy applications too. However, this general approach\nof understanding how to better align human motivation and behavior toward\ndesired ends could reduce the number of instances in which policy is heavy\nhanded and thereby inspire greater teamwork and cooperation between those\nwho make laws and those who must live under them.\nTechnique 1: Identify the Human Problem\nMarketing discussions frequently begin with a business challenge: for example,\nhow do we get more people to buy our product? How do we increase revenue\nover last quarter? How do we overcome a product failure? In government, par-\nallel conversations might include topics such as how do we address the problem\nof homelessness? How do we slow the opioid epidemic? Or, what is the best way\nto stop the conversion of young people to a radical terrorist group? Addressing\nsuch questions is a critical first stem. We need to understand what matters to\npeople and why.\nAt the broadest level, we can postulate that there are some shared human\nmotivations. This is the foundational element of things such as Freud\u2019s theory\nof id/ego/superego and Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. These grand theories are\npossible because as diverse as human cultures are, we are all fundamentally\nhuman. Across the globe and through time, our shared humanity has resulted\nin some shared problems \u2013 for example, how to raise the young and bury\nthe dead, how to manage conflict and build alliances, how to control and\nallocate resources, and how to address fears and disappointments. While\ncultures have often devised particular and unique strategies for such chal-\nlenges, tailored to the unique circumstances of their geography or resources,\nthe challenges themselves remain constant. This is evident in cross-cultural\ncomparisons of childrearing (Whiting 1963), shame and fear (Lakoff 1987),\nand resistance (Scott 1985). This is also the foundation of the Human Relations\nArea File, an expansive database that tracks human behavior cross-culturally\nand through time (see http://hraf.yale.edu).\nIf we presume that humans have addressed shared challenges over time and\nacross space, then one way to understand a given human behavior is by study-\ning behaviors that look similar, with attention to the rationale and explana-\ntions given for those actions. This technique provides a more limited range of\npotential motivation for any specific behavior or a range of behaviors for any\nspecific motivation. Two examples from our work in marketing will illustrate\neach effort. First, in an attempt to understand the motivation for why people\nwear cosmetics, we pulled examples of face paint from theater, war, religious\nrituals, beauty, and self-defense. The range of reasons that we found providedDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Second, to elucidate the range of potential behav-\nioral response to stigma, we explored the many ways cultures have managed\nit, including tactics such as humor, distancing, reframing, or subversion. These\nenabled our client (an investment firm) to consider a broader scope of responses\nto the anti-Wall Street sentiment that plagued their work in the wake of the 2008\nrecession.\nHowever, simply understanding the diversity of human behavior and\nmotivations was not sufficient. As noted, these tactics are specific to cer-\ntain circumstances: they reflect the constellation of beliefs, expectations,\nand resources available to different cultures in different times. A simple\ncut-and-paste approach to tactics would not necessarily be successful, so we\nhad to engage in a strategic consideration of what would work for any particu-\nlar client, how the tactics of competitors align against the set of possibilities,\nand how other contextual factors may shape or constrain variations on these\napproaches. For example, in the cosmetics case, knowing that face paint was\noften used in battle to inspire fear and confusion in the opponent is one thing;\nknowing how to translate that into a viable communications and creative\nstrategy is a different task. But it is an important alternative to simply view\ncosmetics as an attempt to lure partners or to hide signs of aging, which are\ntired and rote terrains within the cosmetics industry.\nWhen considering the world of policy, the technique that we used holds\npossibilities for generating new ideas and approaches, especially in well-trod\nterrains. Let\u2019s consider the case of radicalization. While often portrayed\nas a relatively new phenomenon, it\u2019s actually quite ancient. For example,\nradicalization has echoes of religious conversion and devotion, and thus there\nis much to be learned from the historical accounts of Christian crusaders and\nsaints, studies of religious conversion among Pentecostal and Charismatic\nChristians, and studies of religious cults to explore the ways in which religious\ncommunities use language, rituals, and social dynamics to foster a sense of\nboth absence and belonging among new converts. Alternatively, contemporary\nradicalization has parallels to the literature on charismatic leaders, which offer\ninsights into how these individuals often gain such sway over communities.\nYet again, radicalization might be better understood through the lens of stigma\nand shame, with attention to how individuals are made to feel unworthy but\nworthy of redemption through specific acts. One could even see radicalization\nas a rite of passage and study how things like bar mitzvahs and weddings and\ngraduations might shed light on crafting an identity and belonging to a wider\ncommunity.\nThese are a few examples of how the behavior in question can be reframed\nin multiple ways to inspire different ideas about the driving causes and the\npotential solutions. Using this approach of identifying the human problem, the\npoint is to understand a behavior through other behaviors that look like it inDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In every case, the next\nquestion should be: how have communities themselves addressed these issues?\nHow have they mitigated the negative consequences of these behaviors? This is\nthe kind of detail that can be found in historical, ethnographic, and sociological\nstudies of human behavior. For example, understanding the Crusades \u2013 which\ncame to an end only after 200 years of fighting, millions of lives lost, and several\nfailed treaties \u2013 may offer insights on the reality of both military and diplomatic\noptions available in this new era of religious uprising. Alternatively, under-\nstanding that a rite of passage is designed to help a young person secure his\nor her place as an adult within a community provides an alternative range of\ninterventions for young radicals \u2013 one more focused on shoring up the social\nand economic pathways toward full communal participation that keep them\nwithin established (peaceful) folds and out of radicalized terrain.\nBy situating any specific problem within the wider context of human behav-\nior, government officials and policy analysts are able to consider a much wider\nrange of well-tested approaches for channeling behavior toward socially desir-\nable ends. While this alone will not structure policy, it will provide both new\nideas and alternative ways to think about the challenge itself.\nTechnique 2: Rethinking Quantitative Data\nHistorically, the core challenge of the social sciences was data sufficiency:\nspecifically, having sufficient information to make broad yet valid pronounce-\nments about human motivations and behaviors. Yet today, social scientists face\nan almost opposite challenge: we are swimming in behavioral and attitudinal\ndata of all kinds (purchase behavior, exercise data, location information,\nlikes/dislikes, social engagement). In contrast to previous eras, little of this\ndata was collected to elucidate competing theories of human behavior. Little\nwas collected with any theoretical consideration at all, to be blunt. Oddly, this\nrenders it difficult to process, largely because the data is a by-product of other\nthings, not the thing we sought (Madsbjerg 2017). It tends to be a random\ncollection of facts in the absence of a guiding framework.\nFaced with so much information, researchers must determine which data\nsets to explore and how to link them together. We must also be cautious\nabout using interpretative theories to do so. For example, credit agencies\nin 2007\u20132008 used a risk model based on the theory that housing, savings,\nemployment, and debt were in independent sectors of the economy. As a\nresult, they greatly underestimated the significance of problems they saw with\nmortgage bonds. This contributed the massive economic collapse in 2008\n(Silver 2012). In failing to see the emergent interconnections between housing,\nsavings, employment, and debt, they built a risk model based on an unrealistic\nidea of sectoral independence.

Douglas 1992; Bloch 1998; Boholm 2003). In an era of big data, our\nchoice of data sets warrants greater consideration when the complementary\ndata are ostensibly there, but we lack the capacity to thoughtfully determine\nwhat to include, how to integrate the data, and what the models should be.\nThis data\u2013theory inversion has been a bit of a crystal ball for behavioral\nsciences but an admittedly murky one. With so much information available,\nresearchers can often predict certain things without understanding why this is\nthe case. For example, Target can gauge whether its customers are pregnant\nby what they purchase (Duhigg 2012) and Facebook can predict an impending\nbreak-up with relative accuracy (Ferenstein 2014). But neither team has a clear\nexplanation as to why: Target does not know what this purchase behavior\nsignals for cultural attitudes about parenting and motherhood, perceptions of\ndangers and sacrifice, or the influence of experts, social networks, and others\non purchase decisions. Similarly, Facebook knows that the key predictor of\nrelationship longevity is an interest in each other, but it cannot say how couples\nsustain that interest over time in online and offline ways.\nThe real challenge is finding a way to match theory to data in an organized,\nthoughtful fashion that enables exploration of competing explanatory theories.\nIt means building a mid-level framework that will sort massive amounts of data\ninto meaningful dimensions for understanding human behavior without con-\nstraining interpretive possibilities.\nFaced with this challenge, my marketing research colleagues and I took\na step back and structured a framework that would sort data in a way that\naligns with broad concepts in the social sciences but was one level removed\nfrom specific theories. Given that our goal was to identify groups/clusters\nwithin massive data sets, we turned to the early work of anthropologists and\nsociologists to understand how these researchers studied collective behavior\n(c.f. Evans-Pritchard 1940; Mead 2001 [1928]; Benedict 2005 [1934]; Durkheim\n2008 [1912]; Malinowski 2014 [1922]). Historically, anthropologists identified\na geographically located community (the Nuer, the Azande, the Kwakiutl)\nand then detailed how those in the community lived. In reviewing these\nearly ethnographies, we identified 10 dimensions of community that appear in\ndifferent monographs as core axes for defining communities, including:\n1. Landscape: the physical (and now digital) environments in which people\nlive.\n2. Language: the medium of communication.\n3. Creation story: their sense of their history and roots.\n4. Economy: what and how they exchange things; what has value.\n5. Laws: the rules that govern behavior.\n6. Threats: what they fear.\n7. Sacrifice: what they give up in order to belong to the community.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Rituals: how they enact their shared commitment.\n9. Symbols: the things that mean more than what they are and signal identity.\n10. Values: what matters to them and why.\nWe then included the work of sociologists to add additional nuance to behav-\niors within these categories. For example, Mauss\u2019 (1990) [1950] and Appadurai\u2019s\n(1988) works on gift exchange and social life were important to a broader\nunderstanding of economy, whereas Bourdieu (2010) [1984] and Goffman\n(1959) were significant in helping us understand how people use symbols in a\nvariety of ways. In this step, we did not model in specific theories, but looked\nacross the literature to understand the dynamics. For example, we were not\ntesting Bourdieu\u2019s vs. Goffman\u2019s approaches to status and presentation of self,\nbut, rather, we noted that symbolic activity and presentation happened in three\nlevels: things on or part of the physical body (e.g. surgical procedures, clothing),\nmid-range items that signal identity (e.g. employer, frequent flier status), and\nbig ticket purchases (e.g. car, neighborhood). Moreover, there was a noted dif-\nference among theorists as to people\u2019s willingness to publicly embrace and show\nsymbols vs. symbols that were hidden or avoided or unobtainable but desired.\nUsing these core social sciences, we designed a framework that enabled us to\nretrospectively identify community affiliations through the Survey of the Amer-\nican Consumer.2 Run by GfK, this is a massive data set that polls 25 000 people\nyearly on a wide range of topics, including:\n\u2022 Demographics (age, sex, occupation, income, household composition, home\nownership).\n\u2022 Business responsibilities.\n\u2022 Personal and business travel.\n\u2022 Public and leisure activities.\n\u2022 Online/digital behavior.\n\u2022 Consumer attitudes and behaviors (brand preferences and purchase\nbehavior).\n\u2022 Political outlook.\n\u2022 Psychographic questions.\nWe reviewed the 120-page survey question by question and sorted them to\nalign with the 10 dimensions pulled from the early ethnographies. This entailed\nteam discussion and review of each question to determine whether and where it\nfit in the framework. Not every question was included, but every question was\nreviewed. To give a flavor of what it looked like, these are some of the questions\nincluded in our symbols dimension:\n2 There are other data sets used within marketing, such as Claritas, which is managed by Nielsen.\nA variety of factors shaped our choice of the GfK data set, but this should not be read as an\nendorsement of this particular database at the expense of competitor offerings.

We\ntested several clustering techniques for each dimension to see what led to the\ngreatest clarity between the clusters, finally settling on whatever number of\nclusters was needed to yield distinctive groups that were meaningful. It is worth\nnoting that we continued refining the clusters over time by adding in questions,\nremoving questions, and working toward greater clarity across each dimension.\nSome continued to be a challenge (e.g. threats), whereas others produced very\ndistinctive groups early on. For example, our symbols dimension split into four\nunique groups as shown in Figure 38.1.\nWith this framework, we could run any set of brands against each other to\nsee how their communities compared. We could see how risk averse they were,\nhow much they valued social integration, what role routine played in their lives,\nand what worried them \u2013 and how all of these differed by their preferred brand\nfor everything from toothpaste to insurance to luxury automobiles.

The shading of a given cell measures the resonance of a com-\npany\u2019s customers with a given trait. For example, customers of our client (first\ncolumn in Figure 38.2) were not especially influenced by brand (row 1, part\nof Story). They leaned toward a regimented life (row 2 of Ritual), which was\nsharply in contrast with customers of competitors (especially A and C). Our\nclient\u2019s customers were also avid multichannel shoppers (row 1 of Place) \u2013 i.e.\nthey shopped online, in stores, through their mobile phones, etc. Again, this\nwas a very different behavior than that of the competitors\u2019 customers. Simi-\nlar distinctions showed up in that our client\u2019s customers avoided symbols and\nplaced family first (under values).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n874 Aligning Behavior with Desired Outcomes: Lessons for Government Policy from the Marketing World\nThe usefulness of the display was less for a single row than in the pattern\nacross rows and how it revealed something meaningful and understandable.\nOur client\u2019s customers resonated with four traits, one each under rituals, place\nof shopping, symbol, and values. Noting this helped us to understand a per-\nvasive problem with the structure of our client\u2019s program (why people stopped\nparticipating) and offered a new solution that drew upon what mattered most to\nour client\u2019s customers: the social relationships that defined their lives. Specif-\nically, our client\u2019s customers often put other people\u2019s need first \u2013 family was\ntheir driving consideration (Values); they downplayed any tangible symbols of\nsuccess or wealth for themselves (Symbols), while accommodating the needs of\neveryone else by purchasing what each required by whatever means was con-\nvenient (Places). In always privileging others, they would forget to take care\nof themselves, and they only turned to our client\u2019s program when their weight\nstarted to interfere with their ability to be that central caretaker. They left the\nprogram when they felt that participating impinged on others in their family\n(e.g. by not being home with them). Our solution was to restructure the sup-\nport component of the program to include a close friend/family member rather\nthan a stranger or professional.\nThe framework could also be used to identify ways to lure competitor\u2019s\ncustomers into a brand community. Figure 38.3 shows data from an entirely\ndifferent study, one in the insurance industry (again, simplified for this\npresentation). By studying it, we concluded that it might be possible to lure\ncustomers from that of competitor C because customers of competitor C were\nsimilar in several ways to our client\u2019s customers (and different in some other\nways). They were similar for some traits within sacrifice, symbols, threat, and\nvalues but quite different with respect to law and economy. Understanding all\nthis allowed us to suggest a strategy for our client to change its model.\nThe same methods could also be used to predict potential future customers.\nFor example, on a luxury car project (not shown), we used the framework\nto identify which mid-range brand community was most like our client\u2019s\ncustomers: in short, who were the people who buy $40 000 cars and who\nare most like our people who buy $140 000 cars? And how are they different\nas well, so that we might understand how product/service offerings should\nchange over time to accommodate their tastes?\nFinally, the array approach illustrated by Figures 38.2 and 38.3 could be used\nto identify brand pairings by starting with a profile and then exploring what\nbrands tended to cluster against it. For example, do people who shop at Whole\nFoods also tend to shop at certain other stores? If so, what might this reveal\nabout neighborhood dynamics, brand affinities, mental models about what fits\ntogether in a person\u2019s life, and a host of other questions as to why patterns exist\nacross brands and categories?\nIn every instance, we supplemented this work with other research: primary\nqualitative work (interviews, observations), secondary research, businessDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

But over and again, the framework proved\nrobust in giving a unique picture of a community that was more accurate and\nmore actionable than most other segmentation approaches seen in the industry\nand more rigorous than could be achieved solely with qualitative methods\nimplemented on these time frames (typically measured in weeks).\nAt this point it is important to illustrate how analogous approaches can be\nused improperly. Cambridge Analytica, the firm reputed to have influenced the\noutcomes of the Brexit vote and the 2016 US presidential election (Lapowsky\n2017), created just this sort of framework in its big five personality profiling\nassessment (Bisceglio 2017). Like us, they created a mid-level framework\ngrounded in social theory (we used anthropology; they used psychology). In\nboth cases, the work enabled analysts to see both the connective patterns\nacross particular domains and the unique intervention points that could be\nused to shift behavior.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n876 Aligning Behavior with Desired Outcomes: Lessons for Government Policy from the Marketing World\nHowever, our data gathering techniques differed in important ways. Our\nteam used an existing survey in which participants had been reimbursed\nfor their time and knew the data would be used for marketing purposes.\nCambridge Analytica did not. Their wanton disregard for established reg-\nulations regarding accessing user data and their disregard for social norms\nabout harvesting data from social networks (see Granville 2018) are important\ncaveats about the power of social science modeling. The Cambridge Analytica\nwork apparently violated contractual requirements and misused personal data\nin what may have been an illegal effort by a foreign power (Russia) to influence\nthe US election. Russian information warfare efforts were alarming enough to\nstimulate creation of a special investigation (the Muller inquiry) and multiple\ncongressional hearings interrogating executives and former executives of\nCambridge Analytica and Facebook. Thus, unscrupulous use of some social\nscience methods akin to those used properly in the business world has raised\nmajor national security issues. More generally, such methods and their efficacy\nraise major privacy and ethical issues regarding data, issues that have not yet\nbeen adequately confronted (Balebako et al. 2019).\nApplied to social questions, this technique can be used to provide nuanced\ninsight into entrenched problems. For example, there are likely multiple groups\nwithin the anti-vaxxer movement, and understanding how they differ and how\nbest to appeal to their specific concerns would enable states to offer tailored\ncommunications through pediatricians, rather than simply imposing mandates\nthat all children must be vaccinated in order to attend public schools. Moreover,\nsome of these groups may have parallel challenges in other policy terrains. For\nexample, if some are anti-vaxxers because of logistics around getting children\nto public health clinics, these same individuals may struggle with regular medi-\ncal care and would benefit from a school-based or home-visiting program. The\nbroader point is that employing a framework that assesses behavior and moti-\nvation across policy terrains may provide more nuanced insights into how to\nencourage greater alignment with social goods than mandates by fiat. This kind\nof mid-level structure that sorts massive data set while maintaining open theo-\nretical interpretation could prove a powerful ally in designing effective policies,\nwhen done with respect for existing regulations governing consent and access\nto personal data.\nTechnique 3: Rethinking Qualitative Research\nIf one of the end goals of both policy and marketing is to change behavior, then\nit helps to understand why, when, and how people do \u2013 or do not \u2013 change their\nbehavior. This is the terrain of qualitative methods: they shine in their ability to\nprovide richness and contextual perspective on a particular topic. For example,\nwe may know that more than 1/3 of American adults are overweight, but if weDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nTechnique 3: Rethinking Qualitative Research 877\nignore the varying narratives as to why people become overweight and why they\nprefer some interventions over others, subsequent policies will only work for a\nsubset of the intended audience, if at all. Designing programs to provide greater\naccess to healthy foods will do little if the driving reason lies in ideals of beauty\nor resource constraints for food preparation.\nQualitative methods, however, will not reveal motivation in some magical\nway. In fact, our default reliance on interviews and focus groups can obscure\nmotivation when researchers are not attuned to the broader dynamics at play in\npeople\u2019s lives. To this end, we knew we needed to go beyond verbal accounts of\npast events because, as Herman (2004) noted, the cognitive models that shape\nour understanding of a story change with new events and new experiences, so\nthat our assessment of past choices will alter based on the subsequent outcome\nof those decisions. Similarly, prospective accounts of imagined futures can be\nequally unreliable because they require people to hypothesize about too many\ncontextual variables. For qualitative methods to be useful, they must be orga-\nnized in a coherent and strategic way so as to capture the unique dynamics\nregarding behavior as it unfolds in daily life.\nWhile some of the social sciences specialize in qualitative methods that allow\nus to see behavior as lived in the moment (e.g. anthropology, qualitative soci-\nology, social psychology), researchers in marketing and policy do not have the\nluxury of time typically afforded to such projects. Instead, we often needed a\nway to simulate these critical moments in order to trigger richer reflections\non motivation and decision-making. Moreover, because we were interested in\nbehavior change, we wanted specific tactics to elicit desired changes and learn\nfrom those moments.\nWe turned again to the social sciences and, specifically, to anthropology to\nreview how cultures have organized behavior change. While there is no short-\nage of long-term strategies including behavior modeling and enculturation, we\nneeded something that could be more efficient in instigating change. We found\na solution in rituals. Turner (1970) describes rituals as \u201cculturally salient experi-\nences designed to transform a person, and thus their relationships to others and\nto material goods.\u201d They accomplish this through two tactics. First, they elevate\nsensory features, employing touch, sound, taste, smell, and images to reinforce\nlessons through an embodied experience. As Basso (1992) notes, these sensory\ncomponents become triggers or reminders, in future moments: a wedding ring\nis a daily reminder of promises made and social roles embraced by the couple.\nSecond, they create a shared template within a culture that connects people\ntogether through the experience. This builds bonds across generations, across\ngeography, and links people to a shared identity: Catholics can attend mass in\nalmost any corner of the world and know roughly what is happening because\nof the ritual\u2019s structure.\nCultures use ritual to structure or instantiate behavior change. Rituals\nteach new social roles and expectations through sensory-rich, emotionallyDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

But they do\nso in different ways. We identified four categories of rituals frequently used by\ncultures to address different types of behavior change:\n\u2022 Remembrance: rituals that focus attention on important things/people/\nevents from the past as a way to connect them to the present moment \u2013\nMemorial Day, Easter, Hanukkah, Mawlid an-Nabi.\n\u2022 Deprivation: rituals that require a deliberate avoidance of everyday things as\na way to refocus attention on what matters and to purify/clarify one\u2019s rela-\ntionship with the world and with deities \u2013 Lent, Yom Kippur, Ramadan.\n\u2022 Inversion: rituals that subvert the standard social order as a way to channel\ntransgressive impulses, as in Halloween, Holi, Carnival, Mardi Gras.\n\u2022 Transition: rituals that explicitly change the social status of the partici-\npants \u2013 weddings, funerals, bat mitzvahs, confirmations, graduations.\nOur guiding question became: can rituals help us understand the types of\nbehavior change we would want to see in business? And if so, can we craft\nresearch experiences that mimic rituals as a way to get better insights on the bar-\nriers to and opportunities for behavior change? In short, rather than rely on yet\nanother round of interviews or focus groups, could we shift our perspective on\nqualitative research to have it mimic what we\u2019d want to see anyway \u2013 behavior\nchange \u2013 and have people document this experience in visual, narrative, and\nsensory-rich ways that allowed us to better understand motivation?\nOur first task was aligning business challenges with the behavioral changes\ncreated through each type of ritual and then exploring how to craft a research\nexperience that addresses these challenges. The discussions below were a fruit-\nful starting point, but were not comprehensive: other likely business and com-\nmunications challenges were not covered, just as additional types of rituals\nmight have been included.\nRemembrance\n\u2022 Rituals of remembrance help address challenges around customer loyalty by\nreminding people why this relationship is important and valuable for their\nlives. It is most effective for products that are central to a person\u2019s sense of\nself \u2013 e.g. running shoes for a runner, cooking gear for a chef, and tools for\na carpenter. In market research on these products, when people are asked\nwhy they select a particular brand or engage in a particular activity, it is not\nuncommon for them to respond, \u201cIt\u2019s just what I do,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t really explain\nit. It\u2019s just personal.\u201d\n\u2022 In the same way that couples will recount their courtship on their\nanniversary, we asked people to talk about key events in their lives as an\nathlete/chef/carpenter. To the extent that relationship dynamics change\nover time, with relatively less attention to the good and more attention toDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

For example, when working with elite runners, we had\nthem review their collections of race bibs and medals to talk about different\nmarathons, how they trained, what happened during those specific events,\nand what it taught them about being a runner over time. These stories\nrevealed challenges and frustrations in ways that were difficult to elicit\nthrough standard conversation and provided key insights into how brands\ncould make it better to keep being a runner.\n\u2022 In such ways organizations translate the dynamics of interpersonal relation-\nships into communication strategies: as the things we love to do become\nchallenging, companies can step in to remind us why these things matter\nand to transform difficulties into opportunities for renewed commitment\nand engagement. Translating this into policy, this could help address\nsituations where commitment wanes over time \u2013 for example, tenure in\nthe public schools or among social service case workers, military service,\npolice/fire/emergency responders, and even insider threat challenges to\ncybersecurity or national defense.\nDeprivation\n\u2022 Rituals of deprivation address the challenges of product/service distinction\nby helping people gain a new appreciation for the role of a taken for\ngranted item in their daily/weekly routine. Unlike the products that fall\ninto the remembrance terrain, deprivation focuses on the everyday things\nin life \u2013 toilet paper, laundry detergent, and garbage bags \u2013 items where\npeople have a preference and tend to purchase by habit, but may also swap\nif something is cheaper or more accessible. They tend not to have the same\nstrong loyalty ties as those we see in remembrance terrain, but they do fulfill\nmuch of that background space as well.\n\u2022 As a research tool, deprivation projects involved asking people to give up cer-\ntain items for a period of time \u2013 typically a few days or more. We ran one on\nbehalf of a company that made kitchen products (garbage bags, containers,\nplastic wrap). In this category, people will typically say that they purchase a\nbrand as habit or because it\u2019s affordable. There is little thought as to what\nrole these products play. However, when they no longer had access to them,\nthey struggled to make daily life work without these items, and they gained\na deep appreciation for how these products enabled their everyday lives to\nflow as expected.\n\u2022 When forced to give up items or to find substitutes for them, people quickly\nsee how things are integrated into their wider lives. This realization can\nfoster either a greater appreciation for something or a desire to restrict itsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

In the policy world, this has tremendous potential to shed light\non the challenges people face when trying to give up a negative behavior\n(e.g. drugs, alcohol, smoking, sweets, risky sex, etc.). By situating these\nbehaviors within an integrated view of a person\u2019s life, researchers can\nsee what else is lost in that transition and how these losses may inspire\npeople to continue with negative behaviors. Moreover, they provide insight\ninto positive experiences that could be expanded by that individual.\n\u2022 Finally, as a policy teaching tool, deprivation can also be a powerful way to\nfacilitate empathy for the challenges people face trying to feed a family on\nwelfare payments, or find a doctor who takes Medicaid, or manage finances\nwhile living on minimum wage. By taking away the privileges afforded those\nwho do not rely on government support systems, policy-makers themselves\ncan gain a new appreciation for the challenges of navigating the very systems\nthey are charged with managing.\nInversion\n\u2022 Rituals of inversion help organizations explore opportunities for innovation\nby loosening the rules and expectations around how people use goods or\nservices and encouraging them to think differently. Inversion rituals sus-\npend category standards and deliberately challenge conventions as a way to\ndocument and explore what happens when anything goes. In the colloquial\nlanguage of business, inversion helps organizations identify white spaces of\npossibility.\n\u2022 In our work, we typically used this approach when a category was\ndominated by a particular model or narrative. For example, when working\nwith a Caribbean nation on its tourism account, we conducted a semiotic\nanalysis of the language and imagery used by competitor nations in their\ntourism work. It was, as we noted, a sea of sameness: beaches, drinks, escape,\nand tune out. All downplayed the challenges of navigating their country;\nthey also provided only limited engagement with local communities \u2013 often\nbecause such engagements can be complicated or uncomfortable. We\nrecruited travelers who recently visited our client country to understand\nwhat made it interesting and unique and why they selected this destination\nover the many other options. By focusing on the differences and designing\na visual and communication language that was the inverse of other com-\npetitors, we transformed the conversation around travel itself and grew the\nnation\u2019s GDP by 4% as a result of increased tourism.\n\u2022 Inversion works well when conversations essentially stall. In the policy world,\nthis happens all too frequently when political opponents entrench in oppos-\ning positions and essentially refuse to consider alternatives. Or, when people\nhave come to accept a subpar system as just the way things are.

For example, 30% of parents who\nhave a child with special needs ultimately leave the workforce entirely in\norder to manage the challenges and demands of raising their kids (USDHHS\n2004). Rather than just accept that \u201cthis is really hard,\u201d inversion activities\nwould turn that experience around to consider a multitude of ways to change\nthe situation: perhaps through extending parental leave, facilitating flexible\nwork schedules, allowing less than full-time positions, or providing specialty\ncare services during nontraditional work times (evenings, weekends, etc.).\nTransition\n\u2022 Rituals of transition help companies when they need to grow their customer\nbase by welcoming new members. Transitions shift people\u2019s sense of them-\nselves from one type of person to another. Whether one prefers butter or\nmargarine, Coke or Pepsi, or any other brand over a competitor, very often\nthese preferences become emotional and entangled in the kind of person\none wants to be. To the extent that one\u2019s identity is linked to products and\nservices, attracting new customers entails more than just be accessible and\naffordable. It means being desirable.\n\u2022 Transition projects work especially well when people have an aversion to a\nspecific brand or category of products. For example, we worked with a luxury\nsports car brand that was either worshiped or reviled by people, with few\nhaving only a neutral attitude about the company. Hence our challenge was\nto get people who swore they were not that kind of person to become exactly\nthat kind of person, if only for a brief while. We did it by mimicking a key part\nof transition rituals: pairing our initiates (those who hated the brand) with\nelders (people who owned and loved this brand). We had them talk and spend\ntime together focusing on the cars. We also had our initiates drive the cars\nthrough their typical daily routines for part of a day to experience their life\nas a person they swore they were not. In the end, most initiates walked away\nwith a greater appreciation for the car \u2013 two even purchased them \u2013 and a\nchanged understanding of why people love them.\n\u2022 Transition projects help counter stigma, lack of familiarity, and interpersonal\nbarriers. In policy, they can be potentially fruitful for a host of issues in which\npeople struggle to understand the lives of other people. For example, to bring\nto light the challenges facing teachers, policy-makers can try that job for a few\ndays (run the classroom, grade the work, deal with students\u2019 personal lives,\netc.). To get people with an opioid and alcohol addiction to seek treatment\nwhen they did not perceive a problem in their behavior, one RAND program\nfound success in encouraging them to just try it for a few weeks, resulting in\n30% of participants staying in treatment (Watkins et al. 2017).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While\npolicy-makers can resort to mandates and draconian measures, these should\nalways be a last resort. The approaches outlined in this piece offer a few ways\nto gain insights into how to encourage, or nudge, people into better options.\nIn an ideal situation, projects include all three components: start with asking\nthe right question, explore community dynamics through quantitative data\nsets, then create qualitative projects that pilot the desired changes. Given\nthe political, economic, and legal challenges that arise from poorly designed\npolicies, these methods offer a way to better understand how to bring people\nalong with proposed changes and how to design better options from the\nstart.\nReferences\nAppadurai, A.

Myers\nNet Assessments, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Washington, DC 20511, USA\nPerspective\nThis chapter is less about my own research than about the perspective of\na strategist in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as he looks\nacross many social science activities with an eye toward their value for\nintelligence. It not only is a personal account but also reflects conversations\nwith academic scholars and government personnel who are seeking a more\nfruitful linkage between researchers and decision-makers. My intent is more\none of noting shortcomings and opportunities in the research endeavor than\nextolling the virtues of what is already solid.\nRecent Observations\nAs of 2018, a study committee at the National Academies of Science (NAS)\nis identifying lines of social science inquiry that promise to be beneficial to\nnational security over the next 10 years (National Academies of Science 2018).\nEfforts to survey the next decade have worked well in some fields, such as astro-\nphysics, where a tight-knit community of scientists needs to set priorities on the\ndesign and use of very expensive, shared devices. In social and behavior science,\nhowever, such a survey is fiendishly difficult. I see three underlying conditions\nthat lead to this difficulty:\n\u2022 The interests of social scientists are quite varied and dispersed. They work\nalone or within relatively isolated groups that maintain their own references,\nstandards, methods, and funding sources.\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

In addition, of concern to those\nof us in the government who seek help, some scholars eschew any contact\nwith national security organizations on moral grounds, though this senti-\nment has moderated in recent years.\n\u2022 Social scientists are not professionally required to or rewarded for looking\nfar ahead. Groups certainly organize around a set of methods or concerns,\nbut there are rarely any large, shared investments to manage. Those who do\nlook too far ahead may be criticized for being speculative or even grandiose.\nSeveral scholars who have contributed to the NAS decadal survey have had\ndifficulty shifting their focus. While wonderfully articulating about their work,\nthey can be struck dumb when asked by a committee member what benefits to\nnational security they can imagine over the next decade. It\u2019s not a question they\nare ever expected to answer. Nevertheless, the question exposes a gulf between\nthe research that is performed and the need to govern wisely and securely. If,\nas many believe, we are at a major point of transition toward complex social\nmodeling, we might consider how the question of usefulness appears in this\nnew context and of what a fresh answer might consist.\nThe NAS committee\u2019s search for lines of research that will be useful to\nnational security rests on an understanding of evolving security problems.\nMembers of the intelligence community (IC) have provided insights into what\npolicy-makers need and what intelligence advisors are offering. While the IC\nisn\u2019t the only conduit through which leaders learn about social reality that can\ninform and improve their actions, it is an important conduit that is constantly\nassessed for its truth and effectiveness in fostering understanding. Through\nthese discussions, both social researchers and intelligence analysts agree that\npolicy-makers will not be consuming social science findings directly. In several\nsenses, scientific findings need to be translated:\n\u2022 Scientists typically seek generalizations about multiple cases under stan-\ndardized conditions, while policy-makers face unique situations with a\nspecific set of circumstances. If the generalizations are to apply, one has to\nreconsider how well they apply to particular situations.\n\u2022 Scientific findings are often expressed in terms that are difficult for decision-\nmakers to interpret. Scientists recognize the difficulty when educating\nundergraduates. They will often revert to stories and colloquial language in\nlectures, and students are assigned readings from classic works that would\nnever pass muster if offered as a journal article or dissertation.\n\u2022 However well the scientists communicate with undergraduates, they may\nfail to \u201cspeak the language\u201d of policy-makers or anticipate what they want\nto know. A familiarity with statecraft makes the communication of scientific\nfindings to such consumers more effective.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

While social sci-\nence findings have not traditionally had a deep and direct effect on intelligence\nproducts, there is a growing need and willingness to use such sources. As situa-\ntions have become more complex and confusing and where stock answers have\nbecome less convincing, some IC briefers have said that policy-makers are now\nasking for deeper understanding. They are more willing to sit for deep dives\nwhere complexities, uncertainties, and different ways of framing the problem\nare elaborated. This is an opening for social science.\nIn what is called anticipatory intelligence, analysts venture beyond a factual\nupdate to present a more systemic understanding, replete with dynamics that\nare expected to shape events. A separate project at the National Academies is\nmeant to support this burgeoning specialty in the IC. The theories that describe\nvarious social and behavioral phenomena, such as deterrence, are being gath-\nered and synthesized for the purpose of reminding the analyst of the many\nfactors and interactions proven in the scientific literature to be either relevant\nor irrelevant.\nTranslation of this kind is certainly needed, and there is much that can be\ndone at every stage of intelligence production to gather the value of social\nresearch and make it available to support wise statecraft. Yet this process\nof translation rests on some assumptions that deserve further examination.\nRather than assuming a wide and permanent gap between social science\nresearchers and the policy-maker and placing the intelligence analyst as the\nnecessary conduit between them, would it be possible to reduce the gap, even\nto the point of not needing the intelligence intermediary at all?\nSenator Patrick Moynihan, a social scientist turned politician, ably advocated\nfor policy that had a strong grounding in research. This is not to say that his\npolicy positions always proved to be superior, but he forced a deeper under-\nstanding of family and cultural dynamics among his peers, and social policies\nthat he participated in shaping were not drawn in ignorance or by prejudice.\nWe may also point to influential advisors who drew on academic research,\nsuch as Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. (Kissinger, interestingly,\nbarred intelligence advisors from policy discussions.) There is no chance that\nthe United States would ever, as a rule, appoint what we might disparagingly\ncall Mandarins or philosopher kings, but a bit more education and research\nexperience among our leaders and advisors might reduce the gap. To some\nextent, this is achieved through the professionalization of Congressional and\nNational Security Council staff, who often perform translation (of a somewhat\ndifferent kind from intelligence reporting) by bringing both reasonableness\nand social science knowledge to policy deliberations.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

DoD\u2019s\nStrategic Multilayer Assessment (SMA) program brings together a large num-\nber of military personnel with a large number of social researchers (Strategic\nMultilayer Assessment 2018). The military personnel are not standing back\nfrom the discussion, nor are they requiring advice directly applicable to sit-\nuations preconceived as military threats. They are eager to gain understand-\ning of patterns that underlie current challenges, especially for situations where\nconventional military practices are no longer convincing. For example, when\nRussians attempt to subvert countries with information operations, are these\nattacks effective, and if they are, can or should these actions be countered or\ndeterred? There are many new features to these situations that require new\nthinking backed by research.\nLike their military counterparts, the researchers who are drawn to the SMA\nprogram often break frame from the typical academic role and speak about\nspecific applications of their findings. Those in the academic mainstream may\nlook down upon this work and not reward it as they would publications in pres-\ntigious scientific journals. But there are different rewards, such as government-\nfunded studies, consulting opportunities, and service to the nation.\nWhat is especially interesting is that very few intelligence personnel attended\nthe last SMA conference. One would think that IC translators would find this\nevent to be an excellent opportunity to develop relationships on both sides of\nthe gap. But let\u2019s put that issue aside and dwell further on how social sciences\ncan better serve statecraft over the next 10 years. I believe that this will require\nsome breaks with conventional standards and practices. In the next sections, I\nreview relatively recent shifts in the research community that appear promis-\ning, beginning with phronetic social science.\nPhronetic Social Science\nDuncan Watts has sounded a warning: \u201cTen years into the era of what is now\ncalled computational social science, it seems to me that more data, and even\nbetter data, is not enough. Nor has the influx of physicists and computer\nscientists into the social sciences over the past two decades clearly ameliorated\nthe coherency problem. Far from the social sciences acquiring a coherent\nphysics-inspired core of empirically validated theoretical knowledge, they have\ninstead acquired a whole new batch of physics-inspired models that have, if\nanything, added to the confusion\u201d (Watts 2017).\nWatts argues that social science can make headway on the problem of inco-\nherence through use-inspired research. Instead of developing many incommen-\nsurable theories for the same facts, organizing around practical problems may\nresult in findings that build upon each other. Perhaps so, but let\u2019s pause at the\nword use. That is a recommendation to take on a perspective, inevitably an\ninterest in society.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nPhronetic Social Science 889\nFlyvbjerg reaches back to Aristotle for guidance at this juncture (Flyvbjerg\n2001). Aristotle taught that the social and political realm requires phronesis,\na type of knowledge different from that of the physical realm. A leader with\nphronesis has good judgment and act with wisdom. We moderns don\u2019t intu-\nitively grasp that the ability to negotiate political situations with good judgment\nis a type of knowledge, though this is what we want leaders to do. It is possible\nfor social scientists to contribute to this knowledge if they address the leader\u2019s\nproblem directly. This doesn\u2019t mean that all the existing methods need to be\nthrown out nor that we dispense with objectivity or theory, but it does mean\nthat the work of social science becomes directed toward use within political\nreality, as Watts recommends. Flyvbjerg summarizes: \u201cThe primary purpose\nof phronetic social science is not to develop theory, but to contribute to soci-\nety\u2019s practical rationality in elucidating where we are, where we want to go, and\nwhat is desirable according to diverse sets of values and interests: The goal of the\nphronetic approach is to add to society\u2019s capacity for value-rational deliberation\nand action\u201d (Flyvbjerg 2016).\nOne implication of use-inspired phronetic research is that we embrace the\ncase study as a means toward knowledge. The unique characteristics of a case\nare exactly what a decision-maker faces, and scientists should not be deterred\nfrom dealing with the case as is or believe that case inquiry is somehow inferior.\nIn fact, there are good arguments that it can be superior (Flyvbjerg 2007).\nWhile we take on a perspective, that does not make us blind to other perspec-\ntives. In fact, perspectives become thematic, aimed at truly understanding the\ndifferent views and motivations and how they clash. This is particularly impor-\ntant with the international and intercultural issues that the IC deals with. For\nthose, different actors can frame the situation very differently. It becomes cru-\ncial to understand the just aims of all the actors as they see them, even though\nAmerican understanding differs.\nIn this approach, systems are not being isolated from their environments\nin order to make them analytically tractable. Similarly, phenomena favored by\none discipline (such as economics) are not isolated from phenomena favored\nby other disciplines (such as politics). Influences from environments are ever\npresent in reality, and studies that omit them from consideration render mis-\nleading results, creating a sense of surety that is not justified. An awareness\nof environmental factors and interpenetrating systems helps a decision-maker\ngain an accurate understanding of contingency and uncertainty. This requires\nthat the researcher take at least an interdisciplinary approach (but it is better\nnot to isolate systems and disciplines in the first place).\nThe resulting studies may seem vague and inconclusive but appropriately so.\nResults offered in the form of an optimal strategy within an intentionally sim-\nplified and isolated representation of the problem are misleading. We are often\nled to believe that, while a true representation of the problem isn\u2019t delivered\ntoday, it is just around the corner, typically with more data, more epicycles, and\nmore funding. The wise decision-maker requires something else. As operationsDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

The\ndecision aid will be a richer understanding of the complex thicket of influences\nand the potentials for shaping and developing the situation. This kind of sci-\nence is not entirely unfamiliar. Some scientists will claim that it is exactly the\nmuddled thinking that we are trying to get past. But observe what has been hap-\npening in the field of economics. After a lengthy detour into a mathematized\nstandard model, several strains of open, systemic inquiry are returning, and\ndecision-makers are finding it enlightening and useful. This includes institu-\ntional economics, behavioral economics, ecological economics, and even eco-\nnomic history, all supported by big data, but not at the same time dominated\nby simplifying assumptions and formalisms.\nThe rear guard will continue to fight back, spouting rigor and other shibbo-\nleths to keep science pure in a particular way. Yet these methodological com-\nmitments, enforced by academic incentives, can limit the contribution of social\nscience to sensemaking in complex environments. It is interesting to see how\nthis tension has played out over the years in the American Political Science\nAssociation. In the 1960s, some members wanted to speak more freely about\nthe political controversies of the day. A compromise was reached, whereby\nmembers who wanted to organize nonsanctioned events were given space to\nmeet after the conclusion of the conference. They were eventually allowed to list\nthese events in the back pages of the conference book, apart from the officially\nsanctioned agenda. Over the years, the official sessions become staid. These ses-\nsions were necessary for careerists but were of middling interest to those who\nwanted to understand politics. In recent years, the \u201cback of the book\u201d sessions\nhave commanded the largest spaces and attracted the largest audiences. Some\nof the most popular sessions are run by political philosophers whose level of\nscholarship is unquestionably high though clearly out of step with the remnants\nof positivism and behaviorism.\nCloser to home, this tension was visible in a prior National Academies project\nsponsored by the IC, where social scientists were tasked to examine the craft of\nintelligence (National Research Council 2011). In one of the public meetings,\nan exasperated scholar asserted that the intelligence process was unscientific\nand needed the standards that he was using. Members of the IC didn\u2019t take\nkindly to this suggestion; they viewed the bulk of social science as a game that\nis irrelevant to the needs of statecraft (Myers 2010).\nQuite recently, another NAS committee of social scientists was asked to\nassess the value of social science in terms of addressing national priorities\n(National Academies of Science 2017). In other words, is social science\nrelevant, and in particular, is it relevant to national security? The panelists\ncautiously concluded that some social science does have significant value, but\nwhich part? A questioner at the presentation of this study wanted to know\nwhether the panelists, all of whom made their careers as quantitative scholars\nholding central positions in their fields, were speaking only of the brand ofDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Did they think that qualitative research had any\nvalue or only minor value? Years ago, the response might have been a polite\nacceptance of qualitative research, perhaps as an unavoidable preliminary to\nthe conduct of real science. But the answer this time was quite different. All\npanelists indicated surprise at the question. They saw no essential distinction\nbetween qualitative and quantitative research and asserted that both types of\nresearch could be rigorous and highly valuable.\nBased on convergent methodological trajectories, the gap between\ncase-oriented intelligence and social science may appear to be collapsing,\nbut the communities continue to thrive in parallel worlds with very limited\ncontact. Eventually, one would hope to see that the IC is both drawing from\nand contributing to the phronetic portion of the scientific corpus on a regular\nbasis. The evidence so far is scant, though the potential for greater two-way\ncollaboration abounds (Argrell and Treverton 2015).\nCognitive Domain\nA recent turn in social science is toward the cognitive domain. While this move-\nment takes many directions, a major starting point was to simply drop the\nbehavioristic rule that behavior, because it is measurable, is all that matters.\nWhat people are thinking has always mattered for statecraft, and social science\nhas found a way to rejoin the conversation about political thought, bringing\nalong big data computation with new kinds of measurement (McCubbins and\nTurner 2012).\nWhat is an actor? Interpretive social science answers this question differently\nfrom most reductive methods. Jerome Bruner, an early proponent of a practi-\ncal American strain, spoke of the \u201cstory structure of experience\u201d (Bruner 1990),\nmeaning that \u201caction is understood in the same way as a plot in a narrative.\nAction is always symbolically mediated, symbols acting as a quasi-text that\nallows conduct to be interpreted\u201d (Ezzy 1998). While many scholars launch\ninto flights of hermeneutical elaboration at this point, others address some very\nworkaday concerns for the IC. Al-Qaeda and ISIS have little more to offer than\nstories, after all, and look at how durable their stories are and the dramatic\nactions that result.\nThe NAS decadal committee ran a full-day workshop on narrative, sensing\nthat there is much more to be learned about it that will benefit national secu-\nrity. We now have recorded linguistic data as never before, full of symbols that\nmediate action, posing a major interpretive challenge. While computation can\u2019t\ndo the job alone, it can do quite a lot to identify patterns of meaning and com-\nmunication that will harm or help US national interest. The military recog-\nnizes that nonkinetic conflict, waged with words and symbols, has become seri-\nous business.

Advanced sentiment analysis software can do a better job of\ncharacterizing the barrage of messages, but it remains difficult to tell what the\nactual effects are, plus what an appropriate response will entail. One has to con-\nsider, for example, social identity, a vague but certainly powerful way in which\npeople frame words and events and are moved to act.\nSome motivations defy easy characterization. LTG Michael Nagata pointed\nout in an SMA session that, while we can describe the ISIS ideology of death, it\nis not obvious why many people find this ideology sensible and appealing. With-\nout that understanding and related understanding of motivations, our strate-\ngies may be ineffective (Davis and Cragin 2009). One of the white papers sub-\nmitted to the NAS committee argued that conventional psychology has failed to\nfully illuminate the appeal of ISIS ideology and that it is more fruitfully framed\nas a spiritual disorder, of a piece with the millenarian outbreaks during the\nMiddle Ages (Franz 2017). A decadal committee member recognized that this\nwas a neglected direction for cognitive research, violating certain rules about\nwhat psychology may legitimately address yet clearly of practical significance\nto national security.\nIn more mundane affairs of state, we have a lot to learn about the emotional\ncomponent of cognition. Studies show that a certain ratio of positive emotions\nto negative emotions (between roughly 3 to 1 and 6 to 1) is correlated with flour-\nishing, understood as a state of positive functioning and positive feeling most\nof the time. People who have a lower ratio or higher ratio are less likely to be\nflourishing. That might sound like a measurement nightmare, but the concepts\nalign with human experience, and reliable ways have been found to measure\nthem at the individual level (Fredrickson 2013).1 What is unexpected is that\nthis finding scales up from individuals to whole countries. The 20 top flourish-\ning countries have populations in the 3\u20136 positivity ratio range, the same range\nthat would predict high flourishing at the individual level. See Figure 39.1 below\n(Myers 2018).\nIt is not obvious why this relationship should repeat at the national level.\nFuture research may hold some surprises. If the ratio in a country were to\nrise, would this facilitate development, rather than merely reflect it? If leaders\nare truly able to influence the emotions of a population, might emotional\njawboning be more consequential than we suppose? This is all highly spec-\nulative, of course. I am merely illustrating that cognition has something to\ndo with statecraft and that use-inspired inquiry into cognitive phenomena\nhas potential. Novel data collection will be required, along with novel theory,\nmeasurement, and modeling.\n1 Fredrickson (2013) withdrew her prior claim for a specific, optimal positivity ratio, but she\nstands by a more relaxed claim used here that a \u201chigher positivity ratio is better, within bounds.\u201dDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It\nis possible to relax these assumptions. Behavioral economics, for example, rec-\nognizes that people use biases that create results that deviate from the assump-\ntions of a rational actor. Complexity theory relaxes the assumptions of con-\nventional economic theory concerning equilibrium and diminishing returns.\nAnother troublesome assumption remains, one that cuts much deeper.\nThis common assumption is that a social system doesn\u2019t change in relation\nto what it is observing about its own actions and perceptions and particularly\nabout its expectations. This act of self-observation is referred to as reflexivity, a\nmajor dynamic that generates uncertainty and perhaps increasing uncertainty,\nas social systems become increasingly informed and more densely linked.\nThe effects of reflexivity are most easily viewed in the stock market. Falli-\nble investors perpetually misprice stocks according to their biases. When a\nprice begins to rise, investors will follow, sensing that others perceive increas-\ning value. At a certain point, there is a large gap between what many perceive as\nthe value vs. the actual value, and at that point, the belief in the perception col-\nlapses. Thus, a run-up of a stock price often begins when many view a stock to\nbe underpriced in relation to its future earnings. The price will rise gradually,\nwhich by itself promise higher future earnings, generating more investment,\nbut then, the price collapses quickly after it reaches a peak that is no longer\nbelievable. It drops even faster due to the use of leverage when purchasingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

To try to analyze this situation simply with data trends or supply and\ndemand misses why and how the market works. Mimicry among market play-\ners observing each other is itself an influence on what the market contains\n(Harmon et al. 2015).\nGeorge Soros analyzed financial market in this manner and says that this\nis how he made his billions, by assessing contagious perceptions, typically in\nsituations far from equilibrium (Soros 2014). He explains: \u201cCentral to my world-\nview is the idea that human affairs\u2014events with thinking participants\u2014have a\nfundamentally different structure from natural phenomena. The latter unfold\nwithout any interference from human thought; one set of facts follows another\nin the causal chain. Not so in human affairs. The causal chain does not lead\nfrom one set of facts to the next, but connects the situation and the participants\u2019\nthinking in a two way, reflexive feedback loop\u2026 since there is always a diver-\ngence between the participants\u2019 view and the actual state of affairs, reflexivity\nintroduces an element of uncertainty into the course of events that is absent in\nnatural phenomena\u201d (Soros 2009, p. 284). He goes on to argue that fallibility and\nreflexivity are endemic to all social systems and are particularly important for\nactors to be aware of who must formulate expectations to guide decisions with\nbroad consequences. This mode of analysis does not guarantee the elimina-\ntion of errors, in that all social systems are indeterminate and unknown biases\nremain, but it can create a useful edge. It also renders suspect other kinds of\nmodeling that purport to offer something more reliable, based on what are\nimagined to be constants in society.\nThis is not to say that existing analytics are worthless, only that they have\na range of application, typically within what Dave Snowden (developer of the\nCynefin framework for aiding decision-making) calls the complicated environ-\nment, where professional rules of thumb work and where relationships persist\nover time. In the complex environment, where there is greater volatility and\nstresses that change relationships in unpredictable ways, analytics that encom-\npass reflexivity are called for. Snowden recounts the time when he presented\nthis distinction between complex and complicated to Admiral John Poindexter,\nthen of DARPA, explaining that it is a mistake to apply the methods that work in\nthe complicated regime to the complex regime where they don\u2019t work. Admi-\nral Poindexter quickly grasped the implications and burst out, \u201cThat explains\n50 years of failure in American foreign policy! We treated complex as compli-\ncated\u201d (Snowden 2018). This remark was surely an overstatement, but Poindex-\nter might have been thinking of Robert McNamara\u2019s inappropriate application\nof best practices from the complicated auto industry to measure and manage\nprogress in the complex Vietnam war.\nAn account of complex social reality, one that embraces human agency,\ncognition, and subjectivity, will necessarily be path-dependent and uncertain.\nModels that aid the interpretation of sentiments will certainly be useful.

We may need to think less about setting parameters in deductive,\ndeterministic machines and resume efforts to develop sensemaking skills akin\nto the phronesis of wise decision-makers.\nDevelopments ensue not only from the interaction of focal variables but\nalso from the field itself. The ground is in motion, and there will be trends in\nthe environment that will have a shaping effect on reflexive situations. They\nconstitute an envelope of plausibility through which reflexive scenarios can\nbe drawn. The National Intelligence Council\u2019s (NIC\u2019s) publication, Global\nTrends, has admirably formulated the environmental background of statecraft\n(National Intelligence Council 2016). The integration of this material with\nsituational analysis is unfinished business. It was revealing that James Clapper,\nthe former director of National Intelligence, said that he never had the time\nto read this publication when he was on the job, but after he retired, he was\nable to read it at his leisure and found it very helpful. Somewhere along the\nsensemaking process, somebody will need to take the time to lash long-term\nenvironmental factors with the challenging situations of the day.\nConclusion\nSome of the social science movements I have mentioned have been controver-\nsial, not least because they seem to sacrifice the ideals of simplicity and clarity,\nyet they aspire to comprehend society as we find it, not as we prefer to find it\nunder simplifying assumptions.\nSocial science can help policy, but that will not be an automatic result of\nhaving more data, bigger models, and more findings. For the purpose of wise\nstatecraft, the chronic gap between social science and policy-making needs to\nbe reduced, and this requires adjustments on both sides of the gap. Researchers\nneed to conduct use-inspired phronetic social science. Policy-makers, for their\npart, need to develop as sensemakers who are conversant with the dynamics\nof reflexive social systems and new methods of inquiry appropriate to the\ncomplex domain.\nWhere does that leave the intelligence function? There is enough insti-\ntutional inertia to keep intelligence analysts in business, but secret factual\nbriefings are a thin leg to stand on, especially when so much can be learned\nfrom open sources these days, often with faster turnaround than the IC can\nmuster. Could intelligence inquiry, as it might develop under the new direc-\ntions and standards I have sampled, come to resemble a new phronetic social\nscience?

But there are promising new areas on which to\ntrain the computers. One is the relatively neglected cognitive domain, where\nagreements and disagreements continually construct the unpredictable reality\nthat decision-makers must negotiate.\nAnd then, there are the beleaguered humans, both the expert analysts/\nadvisors and the decision-makers. We have mentioned that they need to\nbecome familiar with new methods and informed by their products \u2013 indeed\nthat is the thrust and value of this volume \u2013 but they should also not succumb\nto either of two abnegations: that their human expertise is dispensable or that\ntheir gut impulses are just fine and in no need of development or refreshment.\nGary Klein has pointed out that there is an attack on expertise from research\nin five areas where the weaknesses of human decision-making have been\nexposed: decision research, heuristics and biases, sociology, evidence-based\nperformance, and information technology, including especially artificial\nintelligence (Klein 2018). Klein makes a stout argument that \u201cnone of these\n[expert-denying] communities poses a legitimate threat to expertise. Left\nunchallenged, the overstatements and confusions that lie behind these claims\ncan lead to a downward spiral in which experts are dismissed.\u201d Rather, the\nfindings should be used to strengthen the work of expertise, the illimitable\nelement of wise governance.\nReferences\nArgrell, W. and Treverton, G.

Davis\nRAND Corporation and Pardee RAND Graduate School, Santa Monica, CA 90407, USA\nOne important function of social-behavioral modeling (SBM) should be\ndecision aiding (Davis et al. 2018; Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2019), but for that\nfunction social-behavioral (SB) models will need to have characteristics that\nare currently unusual. In this chapter, I discuss those characteristics by drawing\non experience in other domains in which model-based decision aiding has\nbeen important. The focus is primarily on informing strategic-level planning.\nStrategic Planning Is Not About Simply Predicting\nand Acting\nA common image of decision aiding is that leaders have a well-posed problem\nto which they need a solution. In this image, various model-based analyses pre-\ndict which option would provide the best results, i.e. which option would be\noptimal. Classic methods include decision analysis and linear programming.\nThe models employed are assumed to be mathematically sound and the data\naccurate, although perhaps expressed in statistical terms. The methods may be\nso good that the solution found can be accepted with confidence. If uncertainty\nanalysis is necessary, it can be simple sensitivity analysis. For example, models\nmay predict heavy snow and ice tomorrow with 20% probability, thereby aiding\na city\u2019s decision-makers as they contemplate whether to have emergency storm\ngroups on duty.\nStrategic decision-making is different. Strategic-level decision-makers are\ncommonly faced with ill-defined problems and may have only a vague and\ntentative sense of what the problem actually is. They may not recognize some\nof the factors that will affect the consequences of choice, much less how\nfactors interact and create, e.g. feedbacks, time delays, and network effects\nSocial-Behavioral Modeling for Complex Systems, First Edition.\nEdited by Paul K.

Uncertainties abound, especially\nregarding predictions about the future (Morgan and Henrion 1992). Profound\ndisagreements may exist about facts, likelihoods, and consequences of taking\na given option.\nThree examples of strategic planning may be useful. First, consider defense\nplanning to establish the size, capabilities, and postures of future military\nforces. Planners do not know the circumstances of future war: how it will\nstart, what strategies will be employed, and so on. Strategic and operational\nsurprises have been common (Bracken et al. 2008). A second example involves\nclimate change. How should planners proceed amid uncertainties regarding\nthe magnitude of such effects as sea-level rise? How high should seawalls\nbe? When, if ever, should the effort to protect coastal urban areas be aban-\ndoned? What should be done to mitigate damage from the next big tropical\nhurricane? How should such mitigation efforts proceed given the varied\ninterests of the tourist, fishing, farming, urban development, and industrial\nsectors? As a final example, consider a healthcare system. It faces major\nuncertainties about legislative developments and related economics, the pace\nof medical developments and their costs, what epidemics will arise, and the\nrise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. No model exists that can provide a correct\nprediction of the future. Think of the unexpected turbulence associated with\nthe Affordable Healthcare Act, efforts to repeal it after the 2016 election, and\ninconsistent efforts to prop it up selectively when repeal efforts failed. On the\ndisease front, think of such surprises as the opioid epidemic of this century or\nthe earlier HIV/AIDS epidemic.\nA related problem is that, despite myths to the contrary, decision-makers\noften do not even know their ultimate objectives. They may express objectives,\nbut those often change (March 1996; Morgan 2003; National Research Coun-\ncil 2014). For example, war objectives often end up different to those initially\nexpressed. Also, when multiple stakeholders negotiate, compromise solutions\nreflect socialization processes in which the various stakeholders come to rec-\nognize (perhaps grudgingly) additional values. This is the realm of so-called\nwicked problems (Churchman 1967; Rittel and Webber 1973; Rosenhead and\nMingers 2002). Yet another reality is that many issues will be revisited over\ntime, with many facts and opinions also changing. Decisions at a given time\nmay be more like establishing an initial rough direction than choosing a final\ndestination. Sometimes, success will amount to muddling through (Lindblom\n1965, 1979) or logical incrementalism (Quinn 1978).\nAiding strategic decision-making, then, is not just a matter of predicting\nthe future, calculating the best option, and taking action accordingly. Finally,\neven the best decision aiding can only go so far because decision-makers must\nconsider factors outside the realm of what analysts can help with (e.g. personal\ncommitments and the give-and-take of politics).

These have included theory, methods, and working\ndirectly with senior officials.\nIn the mid-2000s, an Under Secretary of Defense asked for an approach to\ndecision aiding that would help him conduct capability area reviews to decide,\nin each of various military problem areas, what new military systems to develop\nand acquire. He saw current reviews as disorganized, shallow, and insufficiently\nstrategic. He asked for extension and generalization of some prior work that I\nhad led for the director of another agency. The subsequent study accomplished\nthat and, in the process, noted principles much more general than the problem\nof defense acquisition (Davis et al. 2008a; Davis 2014). The principles empha-\nsized that analysis should help decision-makers with the following:\n\u2022 See and reason about the whole (top-down thinking).\n\u2022 Recognize the multiple criteria for assessing options.\n\u2022 See options as alternative portfolios of investments or actions applying\ndiverse instruments to address the multiple criteria in a balanced way.\n\u2022 Consider an appropriate range of options that anticipate intelligent reactions\n(e.g. by a military or corporate adversary).Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Terminological con-\nfusion is rampant in the literature with authors using words like robustness,\nagility, robust adaptiveness, flexibility, and even resilience to mean much the\nsame thing (Davis 2014).\nThis chapter is not the place to discuss all of these matters, particularly option\nconstruction, but the next few sections discuss gaining a strategic perspective\nby taking a systems approach, studying issues both broadly and sometimes in\ndetail, confronting uncertainty systematically, and finding adaptive strategies.\nThe final section of the chapter draws implications for SBM if it is to be used\nfor analysis to aid policy-makers.\nSystems Thinking for a Strategic View\nConcepts\nThe version of systems thinking that I write about here was pioneered in\npart by the introduction of systems analysis in the 1950s and 1960s (Quade\nand Boucher 1968), first at RAND and then in the Department of Defense\n(DoD) (Enthoven and Smith 2005). The original context was the interplay of\nbudgeting, strategy, and resource allocation in DoD planning. Systems analysis\nbroadened to cover social issues and also morphed into a more comprehensive\napproach called policy analysis with applications to many domains of social\npolicy (Quade and Carter 1989). More or less in parallel, but with notable dif-\nferences, today\u2019s systems thinking was also pioneered by MIT\u2019s Jay Forrester in\nwhat became the method of system dynamics (Forrester 1963; Sterman 2000).\nLater systems thinkers sometimes have taken more qualitative approaches\nfor strategic planning in the corporate world and have emphasized learning\nand adaptation (Senge 2006). Although these strands are the ones I emphasize\nhere, systems thinking has a much longer history associated with figures like\nLudwig von Bertalanffy in biology, Kenneth Boulding in economics, and Peter\nCheckland in operations research (Boulding 1956; Checkland 1999; von Berta-\nlanffy 1951, 1969). Some, like Checkland, have drawn sharp distinctions\nbetween hard and soft versions of systems thinking. I am less comfortable\ndoing so because it is useful to slide from one to the other as befits the\ncontext.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nCharacteristics Needed for Good Decision Aiding 903\nThe systems approach is different from the common social science approach\nassociated with discrete hypothesis testing and competitive but fragmentary\ntheories. Not accidentally, it is consistent with the challenge posed elsewhere\nthat social science needs more unifying theories for use in SBM (Davis and\nO\u2019Mahony 2019). Such work emphasizes a broad and comprehensive, causal\ntop-down perspective (but without the negative connotation of simplistic\ntop-down thinking). This implies the need to incorporate all the variables\nneeded to understand system behavior in causal terms. Paraphrasing a point\nthat Forrester often noted, to omit a variable is equivalent to assuming that\nits value is 0 or 1 (depending on whether it would be in an additive term or\na multiplier). Systems thinkers most certainly believe in parsimony, but not\nthe version of parsimony common in social science. Systems thinkers retain\nvariables that are significant in the future whether or not their significance has\nbeen observed to date; also, they also retain soft variables, some variables that\nare difficult to measure (e.g. mental stress), perhaps treating them as uncertain\nparameters.\nExamples\nA first example illustrates the differences between systems thinking and dis-\ncrete hypothesis thinking. In 2008, DoD requested that RAND conduct a com-\nprehensive review of the social science on terrorism. Our interdisciplinary team\nwas quickly struck by the myriad alleged explanations of terrorism in the liter-\nature: terrorism was due to mental illness; no, it was due to poverty and relative\ndeprivation; no, it was due to a particular religion; no, it was due to any intol-\nerant religion; no, it was a response to tyranny; no, it reflected nationalism\nor an extended version thereof (to mention only some of the explanations).\nAlthough researchers commonly pursue such separate threads, policy-makers\nneed a more integrated picture. This implies that models to aid decision-making\nshould also be more integrated. The subtitle of our book became Putting the\nPieces Together (Davis and Cragin 2009).\nNo unified model existed in the realm of quantitative social science. And\neven if it had, it would have been in the form of regression models with limited\nvalue as aids to strategic decision-making. Fortunately, qualitative social sci-\nence yielded rich insights allowing us to construct a more nearly comprehensive\nmodel, albeit one that was intentionally both qualitative and static. Reportedly,\nthe model proved helpful to DoD officials and commanders. The review also led\nto follow-up research, including empirical case studies to validate and enrich\nthe sub-model describing public support for terrorism and insurgency (Davis\net al. 2012). That was later turned into an uncertainty-sensitive computational\nmodel (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2013, 2017).\nIn roughly the same time period, the DoD\u2019s Joint Staff sought to turn a\nnew field manual for counterinsurgency into something more analytical. The\nmanual was the product of a joint effort of the Army and Marines led byDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It\nhad been informed by historical materials and fresh contributions by social\nscientists. It was, however, a field manual, not something easily used by analysts\nor modelers. The Joint Staff\u2019s Brett Pierson worked with PA Consulting to\ndevelop a system dynamics model to represent the concepts of that manual\n(Pierson et al. 2008). Doing so proved useful because the qualitative version\nof the model (the causal loop diagrams, rather than model outputs) allowed\ndiscussion even by senior officers, of complicated interactions and feedbacks\nwith implications for military planning. Even simple modeling of this sort can\nbe quite informative, as illustrated by another chapter in this volume (Lofdahl\n2019).\nGoing Broad and Deep\nHow Much Detail Is Needed?\nA common point of controversy in modeling and analysis is how much detail\nto include. Scientific inquiry often calls for going deep, and the urge often\nexists to go deep so as to exploit modern computers and low-level data.\nAnalysis in support of policy-makers, however, needs to be different. Even\nwith infinitely fast computers, policy-makers need to reason about, discuss,\nand sometimes reach consensus regarding options to be taken. This implies\nthe need for low-resolution causal models (mental or computerized). That is,\nthe process of abstraction is not just an analytic convenience, but something\nessential for decision-making in all walks of life. None of us can have coherent\nand convergent discussion when talking about tens or hundreds of variables. It\nfollows that we also need models that depend only on abstract (i.e. aggregate)\nvariables. Again, this is general across domains. For example, a physician will\nordinarily discuss issues at the level of organs and tissues, rather than cells or\nmolecules.\nThe feasibility of well-grounded reasoning at an aggregate level depends on\nnature cooperating. Fortunately, the real world is often amenable to approx-\nimate description at different levels of aggregation because of nature\u2019s nearly\ndecomposable systems (Simon 1996). So also, the phenomena of social science\nare describable at different levels of detail (Zacharias et al. 2008), although the\nneatness of separation is not yet well understood, as noted by another chapter\nin this volume (Orr 2019).\nThis said, the devil is often in the details. We all know that aggregate descrip-\ntions can be insidiously misleading as with \u201cSure, you can swim in the pool\nsafely: on average, it\u2019s only two feet deep\u201d or \u201cOn average, students do better\nin classrooms with fewer students, so reducing class size is a priority.\u201d Many\npolicy errors are made with analogous simplifications.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nCharacteristics Needed for Good Decision Aiding 905\nA Dilemma?\nIt may appear that a dilemma exists: on the one hand, we need the high-level\n(low-resolution) synoptic view, but on the other hand, we must worry about\nhigher-resolution details. To proceed, we need to understand the dilemma bet-\nter. Upon reflection, a number of distinct problems arise:\n\u2022 Improper abstraction (incorrect theory): Averages are often a poor basis for\naggregation. The correct aggregation depends on the context in which it\nwill be used. To use the first example above, it may be better to represent\nthe pool\u2019s depth by its greatest depth or by the depth at the stream\u2019s\nclearly marked crossing point. To use the second example, a local school\nboard might care about the average value of reducing class size across\nonly those schools comparable to itself in teaching quality, socioeconomic\nstatus of students, and physical security. This context dependence of\naggregation is seldom noted when authors show diagrams postulating that\nhigher-resolution models should somehow be mapped into lower-resolution\nmodels.\n\u2022 Low-level failures: The validity of an abstraction\u2019s value depends on estimates\nof lower-level variables. For example, the safety of a nuclear reactor estimated\nby engineers will be seriously wrong if any of the reactor\u2019s critical compo-\nnents is built by corrupt contractors with substandard materials. Similarly,\nfailure of an international intervention operation to enforce peace may be\ndoomed to failure in any one of several critical components of the challenge\nthat are sufficiently troubled (security, economics, governance, or sociology).\nSuch components interact nonlinearly (Davis 2011).\n\u2022 System instability: Sometimes, an aggregate-level model has been accurate\nfor a long time, but the complex adaptive system (CAS) that it represents\nfinds itself in a state in which it is extremely sensitive to perturbations. The\nmodel may still be correct on average, but with huge variations is possible\nwith systems on the edge of chaos. As an example, a crowd in a social gath-\nering may seemingly be normal and the security force attending to it may\nbe adequate by historical standards, but the crowd may be ready to erupt\nbecause of recent emotional events. If it erupts, no one knows how it will\nbehave or what will happen.\nResolution of Dilemma\nThese and other reasons exist for worrying about high-level (aggregate-\nor abstract-level) reasoning. Nonetheless, the comprehensive high-level\n(low-resolution) reasoning is crucial. The admonition, then, is that\n\u2022 Analysis for higher-level decision aiding should provide a high-level compre-\nhensive view and provide selective detail where needed.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n906 Lessons on Decision Aiding for Social-Behavioral Modeling\nThat is, decision aiding should provide the high-level view and allow selective\nzooming into detail. The detailed views will only sometimes be necessary. This\nalso reflects common experience. For example, a health system might rule out\nuse of a drug knowing only that it is expensive and has common bad side effects\nand that less costly alternatives exist. Occasionally, however, for a particular\npatient who reacts poorly to the alternatives, assessing the drug in question in\nmore detail would be appropriate.\nWhen being provided analyses, decision-makers appreciate zoom capability,\neven though they seldom have the time or inclination to go into depth. They\ncan expect their staffs and advisors to do so. Further, even a policy-maker or top\nstaffers will sometimes want more depth to test the mettle of those who pre-\npared the analysis, to understand the underlying reasoning better, or to check\non special issues on which they have received backdoor warnings. And to be\nsure, a policy-maker may demand depth when things have gone very wrong\nand it is necessary to understand how and why.\nThis need for selective zooming applies in a number of dimensions. Resolu-\ntion can be higher or lower in, for example, the objects treated (e.g. individuals\nvs. society), the richness of attributes ascribed to the objects (e.g. a simple\neconomic utility function or behavior driven by values, psychology, and per-\nceptions), spatial and temporal scales, or the richness with which relationships\nand interactions are described (e.g. interaction only with adjacent objects\nor with objects anywhere within the relevant social network) (Davis and\nHillestad 1993). This is worth noting because so much discussion of resolution\nand scale overlooks the different dimensions. An agent-based model with a\nmillion individual-level agents may be rich in some respects, but simplistic in\nothers \u2013 if, for example, the agents use the same simple decision rule based on\nmaximizing economic utility.\nHow much selective zooming is necessary for decision aiding? Realistically,\nthe answer is that it all depends. A classroom rule of thumb is that the analyst\nneeds to work at the nominal level of detail, one level deeper to know where pit-\nfalls lie and one level higher to appreciate what simplifications are useful for the\npolicy-maker. This need for multiresolution view has important implications\nfor modeling and analysis.\nConfronting Uncertainty and Disagreement\nUncertainty is a core reality for higher-level planning. So is disagreement,\nwhich logically may be considered part of uncertainty but manifests itself\ndifferently. Confronting these issues is more difficult than recognizing them.\nIntuitively, people often assume that going with a best estimate is good\nenough. Or they have in mind only one or two discrete uncertainties, such\nas how fast the economy will grow next year. Uncertainties, however, exist\nin many dimensions, and best estimates may be counterproductive. In theDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nCharacteristics Needed for Good Decision Aiding 907\npast, attempting to confront uncertainty was often paralytic, which is why\nuncertainty analysis has so often been absent. In the late 1980s, for example,\ndoing better on such matters was highlighted as one of the truly hard and\nimportant problems of policy analysis (Walker et al. 1987). At that time, the\nconcept of multiscenario analysis was just appearing (Davis 1988). Much has\nhappened in the last 30 years and we can now do much better.\nNormal and Deep Uncertainty\nAn admirable textbook discusses uncertainty analysis in depth for variables\nwith uncertainties that can be characterized by parameter ranges or probabil-\nity distributions (Morgan and Henrion 1992). Elegant analysis is possible, to\ninclude analysis informed by Bayesian models accounting for both objective\nand subjective uncertainties.\nMore recent developments address deep uncertainty, a term that traces to\nNobelist Kenneth Arrow (Bankes 2002). Aspects of deep uncertainty have been\nreferred to over the decades as scenario uncertainty, future uncertainty, model\nuncertainty, or real uncertainty. More precisely, one definition is:\nDeep Uncertainty: the condition in which analysts do not know or the\nparties to a decision cannot agree upon (1) the appropriate models to\ndescribe interactions among a system\u2019s variables, (2) the probability dis-\ntributions to represent uncertainty about key parameters in the models,\nand/or (3) how to value the desirability of alternative outcomes.\n(Lempert et al. 2003)\nAs a simple example, how the ball will fall in roulette is uncertain, but we\nknow the odds (normal uncertainty). In contrast, how some war or plague will\nstart in 2030 is not something for which we have useful statistics or reliably\npredictive models (deep uncertainty).\nA crucial first step in addressing deep uncertainty is systematically charac-\nterizing the dimensions of uncertainty so that, in a given study, analysts can\ndecide which to address. Some methods for doing so have proven useful, and I\ndescribe two of them here.\nExploring Uncertainty in Scenario Space\nAn early example was in 1990s defense planning, which included conceptu-\nalizing the scenario space that planning should consider. The left column of\nTable 40.1 shows suggested dimensions (Davis 1994, p. 82). First, what is the\nwar or crisis all about? What are interests? Allies and adversaries? From what\ndid the crisis or war develop? Has there been a long preparation period for war,\nor did something pop up quickly? Second, what are the various participants\u2019\nobjectives and strategies? Third, what are the strengths of the participants: the\nsize and character of their armies, navies, and air forces?

Fifth, what are\nthey physical circumstances of geography, terrain, weather, and infrastructure?\nAnd, last but definitely not least, what do we know and not know about all\nthe interactions and processes? To illustrate the last item, a conceit of combat\nmodeling had long been that the models could predict the results of combat.\nRealistically, the combat models were (and are) unreliable except when results\nare overdetermined, as with massive force superiorities. Ultimately, the models\nhad a base of sand (Davis and Blumenthal 1991).\nThe right column of Table 40.1 is generic, applying to many social-policy\nproblems and defense studies. Different terminology may be appropriate, but\nthe breakdown is a good starting point. For example, in a given study, one might\nreplace Objectives and strategies by Risk-reduction areas because the sponsor\nof analysis likes to think in terms of risk reduction. As another example, row 6\n(relationships and processes) might correspond to different assumptions about\neconomic elasticities, the exponents of a Cobb\u2013Douglas equation, or whether\ntax cuts can stimulate the economy enough to pay for themselves.\nWith this construct, a case or scenario can be seen as a point in scenario\nspace as indicated in Figure 40.2.

Analysts quickly add specifics\nappropriate to the project. Two half-day sessions can be sufficient to open\nminds (\u201cOh, drat, yes we actually need to vary that\u201d), to explicitly narrow scope\n(\u201cThat\u2019s important, but not relevant to our study for the particular sponsor\noffice\u201d), to decide on how to represent the many abstractions (\u201cwe\u2019ll represent\nthis by warning time and consider only two values\u201d), and to set the stage\nfor establishing requirements for modeling and data collection (to include\nrepresenting uncertainties). At least some public documentation illustrates\nhow this was turned into down-to-earth practicalities in early post-Cold War\nanalysis (Fox 2003).\nExploration Guided by the XLRM Framework\nA different framework has been used in numerous social-policy studies dealing\nwith, e.g. climate change, allocating water resources, disease, and epidemics.\nThis is the XLRM framework shown in Table 40.2, as constructed from a study\non robust decision-making (RDM) (Lempert et al. 2003) and various informal\nmaterials used by the study\u2019s authors. L refers to policy levers, X refers to\nexogenous factors outside control of the decision-makers, M are performance\nstandards that decision-makers and their constituents may use to rank scenario\ndesirability, and relationship R describes the ways in which factors relate to\neach other and govern evolution of the future based on the decision-makers\u2019\nchoices of levers and the various X factors.

A variety of\ntactics make the analysis feasible. They can be used separately or in unison in a\ngiven study:\n1. Use low-resolution models as abstractions suitable for exploration.\n2. Decide how the abstract dimensions of uncertainty will or will not be\naddressed (concrete variables and parameter-value sets).\n3. Use appropriate test cases or use sampling methods rather than attempting\nto cover all cases.\n4. Look for patterns that make it unnecessary to look at huge portions of the\nscenario space (e.g. find contours such that results are unacceptable beyond\nboundary lines or, conversely, are fully acceptable).\n5. Hold some independent variables constant because they are known accu-\nrately or believed to be relatively insignificant (e.g. the gravitational constant\nor the average number of numbers in a string that can be remembered by a\nhuman).\nThese tactics are all subtle in practice and analysis continues to be a demand-\ning activity. For example, the model used for exploration must be structurally\nvalid for that purpose (Davis et al. 2018; Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2019). Decisions\non which uncertainties to include are inherently judgmental. Finding appropri-\nate test cases may require analytical sophistication, as in identifying spanning\nsets of test cases (Davis 2014). Sampling methods (e.g. built-in tools for Monte\nCarlo analysis) usually assume independence of variables even though many of\nthe variables of exploratory analysis are correlated. For example, in assessingDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\nCharacteristics Needed for Good Decision Aiding 911\na military defense, it would be folly to imagine that being surprised and being\ndistracted at the time of attack were independent low probability events: a\nsmart adversary would use tactics to achieve both at the same time. Because\nof such correlations, typical exploratory analysis at RAND does not assign\nprobability distributions. Instead, judgments about likelihood are deferred\nto the end of analysis where one or a few judgments are understandable and\nmeaningful rather than buried (Lempert et al. 2003). Finding boundaries\nbeyond which exploration is unnecessary is nontrivial in an n-dimensional\nscenario space (although data-mining methods address this). As for holding\nmany variables constant, choices on this are not uncommonly a source of\nerror, e.g. when one accepts uncritically the validity of an official database or\nassumes that a system will perform according to its original specifications.\nDespite such problems of detail, this method of organizing exploratory anal-\nysis has served well in numerous studies.\nFinding Strategy to Cope with Uncertainty\nAlthough exploratory analysis can be very interesting for the analyst, it is the\ndivergent-thinking part of a study and does not in itself yield anything. Success\nin decision aiding must include a convergent process of finding strategies. A\nnumber of approaches can be taken, each with its own name, process diagrams,\nterminology, and gimmicks. The literature abounds with such approaches. In\nwhat follows I touch upon only three while providing pointers to more general\nliterature.\nPlanning for Adaptiveness with a Portfolio of Capabilities\nThe approach taken in a number of studies has been to find, working iteratively\nwith policy-makers, strategies that are flexible, adaptive, and robust (achieving\nFARness) or, again as shorthand, finding ways to plan for adaptiveness. The\nprocess has been as follows (Davis et al. 2008a; Davis 2014):\n1. Frame the problem as portfolio analysis: Commonly, policy-makers have\nnumerous objectives and should therefore have numerous criteria for eval-\nuating options. They also have numerous instruments to help in reaching\ntheir objectives. The decision, then, is about what mix of instruments\nshould be used to address the mix of objectives in an acceptable way and at\nan acceptable cost. An early example was the 1950s concept of investing in a\nmix of stocks and bonds to achieve both long-term capital gain and reduce\nrisk of losing unacceptably large amounts of capital (Markowitz 1952).\n2. Identify criteria: Identify the multiple criteria needed to address separate\nobjectives and separate major uncertainties. This requires grouping to avoid\ndimensional explosion.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Use policy scorecards to discuss the options by the multiple criteria. Some\nof the criteria can be unabashedly subjective (e.g. quality of life). Do\nnot attempt to optimize with some a priori objective function. Because\npolicy-makers often do not know their objective function (or even have\none), they should review the various options with multi-criteria scorecards\nas illustrated below.\n4. Construct diverse and creative options: Decision-makers frequently lament\nthe poverty of the options that come up from their organizations. Finding\nbetter ones can be nontrivial, involving broad knowledge, organizational\nsophistication, and analytic talents. Sometimes, computational methods can\nhelp, but it is unwise to fall into the trap of ignoring uncertainty when doing\nso. Classic methods for seeking Pareto-optimal options can be generalized to\ndeal with uncertainty (Davis et al. 2008b), something not discussed further\nin this chapter.\n5. Compare options with uncertainty-sensitive displays at different levels of\ndetail. Scorecards provide such a comparison at a high level, zooming\ndown into more detailed scorecards can elaborate, as can separate charts\nand tables communicating dependence on the primary uncertain vari-\nables. When doing so, the approach favors region charts, trade-off charts,\nand other devices that preemptively address beyond-what-if questions.\nFigure 40.3, as explained below, is an example. It might be the result of\nrunning a great many simulations for points within the region plot shown\nand summarizing the results as shown.\n6. Later, build parameterized objective functions to represent alternative\nperspectives. After decision-makers have compared options at the score-\ncard level and directed adjustment of options that balance their concerns\nappropriately, construct objective functions (frequently nonlinear) to\ncapture their preferences and use those to neaten up the analytical work\nby employing optimization methods. The neatening may be important for\ntranslating high-level decisions into more detailed ones.\n7. Show option comparisons with alternative strategic perspectives: Do not\nobfuscate important differences by, e.g. using a single-objective function as\na linear weighted sum of very different ones. As an example, some relevant\npolicy-makers may be short-term oriented, while others are long-term\noriented; some policy-makers might have faith that a particular initiative\nwould work roughly as proposed by its proponents, while others might be\nconvinced that it would prove to be not only ineffective but also counter-\nproductive due to side effects. Such disagreements should be highlighted,\nnot buried.\nSeveral tables and charts can help elaborate. Table 40.3 illustrates a fictitious\npolicy scorecard, the concept for which traces back to the 1970s (Goeller\net al. 1983), but the analogue of which is familiar today in, say, ConsumersDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

It is a region plot.\nSuppose the policy issue is vulnerability to a potential shock, e.g. a hurricane or\nepidemic. Huge uncertainties exist about how big the shock might be or how\nfast it might develop. Figure 40.3a characterizes how well the shock could be\ndealt with today, depending on its size and speed. This provides much more\ninformation than just knowing that it would possible to deal with a particular\nplanning case (the point shown). Suppose, however, that the decision-maker\nis worried about events that have made bigger and faster-developing shocks\npossible and even likely. How should he or she think about options? The intent\nwould be improvement of capabilities that would expand the region of good\nresults and decrease the region of failure. An improvement option (actually, a\npackage of actions) might achieve this as shown in Figure 40.3b. Even if the\nmost likely planning cases were deemed to be not too bad, the improvement\noption would hedge against bigger-than-expected shocks moving faster than\nexpected.\nThe process of assessing capabilities across the relevant space is exploratory\nanalysis. The DoD introduced the related concept of capabilities-based\nplanning in 2001. The intent was and is to have military forces able to address\nwhatever challenges arise, rather than preparing only for some very specific\nscenarios (Rumsfeld 2002). How much can be accomplished in this regard\ndepends on the budget available, the feasibility of meeting the challenges, and\nthe clever use of hedging. Some of the subtleties and controversies about the\napproach are discussed elsewhere (Davis 2014, Appendix B).\nWhere do charts such as Figure 40.3 come from if one is using models, such\nas simulation models, to evaluate developments in a particular scenario? For\nmany problems, such charts can be generated directly from analytical mod-\nels by analogy with what economists, physicists, and chemists have done for\nmany years. For more complex problems, such as those involving social and\nbehavioral phenomena that might be described by simulations, a simulation\nrun generates just a single point in scenario space. Further, it may not be clear\nhow to display results because the model may depend on dozens or hundreds\nof variables. Even if one projects results onto a well-chosen set of two axes,\nthe results may not have the clarity of Figure 40.3. Figure 40.4 illustrates what\nresults might look like, drawing schematically from a notional analysis in which\nreligiously inspired terrorism was modeled by analogy to an epidemic with the\npopulation having a mix of people who are naturally immune to the disease, vul-\nnerable, or immune after recovery (Davis et al. 2007). The course of the disease\n(terrorism) varies with other scenario assumptions. In the figure, the results\nafter some length of time are shown as open circles for good (the disease is\ndying out) to dark dots for very bad (the disease is still growing). Note that the\ngood points and bad points can be found intermingled throughout the space.Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

A pattern is now evident, one looking more like\nthat of simple analyses such as in Figure 40.3. The point is simply that in making\nsense of exploratory analysis, it is crucial to make use of computational methods\nakin to filtering. Fortunately, some excellent methods for doing so exist.\nOne more example is apt.

The general approach they\ntake is similar to the one described above in many ways, but they make greater\nuse of computer search rather than visual inspection. This includes using the\nPRIM algorithm from data mining to find regions of the n-dimensional input\nspace that lead (usually) to good outcomes and other regions that lead (usually)\nto bad outcomes. Their methods are part of the larger RDM toolkit on which\nsubstantial documentation exists, as well as a many completed applied studies.\nLinks can be found at an associated website: https://www.rand.org/topics/\nrobust-decision-making.html. Let it suffice here for me to point to a particularDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Somewhat related methods are used to sum-\nmarize simulation studies (Parikh et al. 2016) with large numbers of agents.\nPlanning Adaptive Pathways\nA third example of decision aiding analysis draws on work at Delft University\nin the Netherlands. The basic idea is to go about strategic planning in a way\nthat allows decisions to be revisited and major changes of strategy made. The\nidea was discussed nearly three decades ago (Lempert and Schlesinger 2000),\nbut the ideas have come far since then. Figure 40.7 shows the essence of the\nconcept in a Metro Chart that identifies alternative pathways (akin to different\nrail lines in a subway system). The city or country at issue might proceed for\nnow along Pathway B (e.g. limited broadening of a river going through a city),\nbut \u2013 after gathering information about actual changes in sea level and updated\nprojections \u2013 switch to another path that would accelerate mitigation programs\n(e.g. greatly broaden the river or add a new channel) or shift to a branch that\nwould actually slow development. The analysts in such work emphasize that\nthey have no illusions about politicians adhering rigorously to the particular\nstrategy illustrated. Rather, it is quite significant if political leaders merely act\nupon the concept of preparing for possible shifts of pathway \u2013 creating options\nfor the future that would otherwise not exist. Doing so has costs (R&D, contin-\ngency planning, contingent contracts), but the potential benefits are large.\nFor other methods, interested readers may want to examine the website of\nthe Society for Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty for a sense of recent\nwork and discussion. The URL is www.deepuncertainty.org.\nImplications for Social-Behavioral Modeling\nUltimately, the purpose in this chapter has been less to discuss analysis\nthan implications for SBM if it is to support higher-level analysis to aid\ndecision-makers. Table 40.5 summarizes admonitions that mostly follow from\nthe discussion of decision aiding in earlier sections. The first admonition\nis a bit different. It urges having an explicit campaign plan for analysis and\ndecision aiding from the start of a project. Instead of just building a model\nand planning to use it, such a campaign may involve bringing to bear a wide\nrange of models, methods, tools, and information sources at different phases\nof the research, analysis, and interaction with decision-makers. Doing so\nwill not happen without conscious planning and a shared understanding\namong contributors of how their efforts support the project (something akinDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Table 40.5 illustrates how thinking\nabout different methods and tools reminds us of their different strengths\nand weaknesses. The example comes from defense planning, but the points\nbeing made are generic. For example, simple models (perhaps as simple asDownloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by RAND Corporation RAND Library Acquisitions, Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2025].

Simulation\nmodels can be quite rich and informative (but only if sufficiently intelligent, as\nwith adaptive agents representing human behavior). They are, however, more\ndifficult to comprehend and less suitable for illuminating strategic-level truths\nanalytically. Human games, field experiments, and historical analysis all have\ntheir strengths.\nThe ratings shown in Figure 40.8 are merely illustrative with particular con-\ntext in mind. In a particular study, the ratings might be quite different.\nIn what way are the admonitions of Table 40.5 conventional wisdom, and\nin what way are they provocative or otherwise nontrivial for those engaged\nin SBM? The answer varies because the range of current practices is so large.\nBy and large, however (Davis and O\u2019Mahony 2019), SBM needs to move far-\nther toward causal system modeling and farther away from the usual correla-\ntion statistics methods of mainstream social science. Dealing with CAS implies\nthe need to anticipate the CAS equivalent of phase transitions, either with a\nset of model types to use in the different domains or models that can operate\nacross the transitions (e.g. variable-structure simulations) (Yilmaz 2019). Relat-\ning to empirical data is different when the intent is decision aiding because the\ngoal is to test, improve, and calibrate a causal model used for reasoning and\ndeeper inquiry, rather than to improve accuracy in the sense of fitting empiri-\ncal data precisely with an algorithm from machine learning. Further, new work\nneeds to take on the challenge of achieving multiresolution models or model\nfamilies, rather than being satisfied sometimes with linking models together\nacross scales or perhaps comparing results of models in different formalisms.\nDesigning models for exploratory analysis and generation of beyond-what-if\ndisplays is crucial because, without designing the models suitably, such work\nwill not easily be possible late in the game without substantial problems. As\na final elaboration on Table 40.5, I note that one of the more robust conclu-\nsions from numerous examples of higher-level decision aiding has been to see\nmodel-supported decision aiding as being a process of educating and preparing\ndecision-makers to understand their problem domain so that they can artfully\nconstruct and choose among options and later monitor progress and adjust\n(Rouse 2019; Thompson et al. 2019).\nAcknowledgments\nSeveral people were kind enough to read and comment on a draft version,\nincluding William Rouse, Richard Given, and Cory Lofdahl.
