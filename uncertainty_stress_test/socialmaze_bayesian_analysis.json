Here are the game rules:\n\nGame Roles:\n- There are 3 Investigator(s), 1 Criminal(s), 1 Rumormonger(s), and 1 Lunatic(s) in this game.\n\nGame Mechanics:\n- There are 3 rounds in this game.\n- In each round, every player will make one statement about another player, claiming whether that player is the criminal or not.\n- Investigators always provide truthful information about whether someone is a Criminal.\n- Criminals make statements about other players that may be truthful or false to confuse others.\n- Rumormongers believe they are Investigators (they are told they are Investigators), but they provide statements that may be incorrect.\n- Lunatics believe they are Criminals (they are told they are Criminals) and make statements that may be truthful or false.\n- Only Investigators provide consistently truthful information. Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and you are told that you are Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information. If you cannot determine your role with sufficient confidence, state your role as \"Unknown\".\n",
