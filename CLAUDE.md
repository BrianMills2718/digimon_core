## 💡 Coding Philosophy

### Zero Tolerance for Shortcuts
- **NO lazy mocking/stubs/fallbacks/pseudo code** - Every implementation must be fully functional
- **NO simplified implementations** - Build complete functionality or don't build it  
- **NO hiding errors** - All errors must surface immediately with clear context
- **Fail-fast approach** - Code must fail immediately on invalid inputs rather than degrading gracefully
- **NO temporary workarounds** - Fix root causes, not symptoms

### Evidence-Based Development
- **Nothing is working until proven working** - All fixes must be demonstrated with logs
- **Every claim requires raw evidence** - Create Evidence files with actual execution logs
- **TDD mandatory** - Write tests FIRST, then implementation, then verify
- **Performance evidence required** - Before/after metrics for all optimizations
- **All assertions must be verifiable** - Commands provided to validate every claim

### Quality Standards
- **100% functionality preserved** - No regressions during refactoring
- **Complete test coverage** - >95% coverage on all modified code
- **Production-ready only** - Every change must be deployment-ready
- **Comprehensive validation** - Multiple verification methods for each fix
