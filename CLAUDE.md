- **TDD Progress**: Days 1-6 complete + Integration/E2E tests complete
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - Unit: 83-95% coverage across unified tools
  - Integration: 14 comprehensive tests (100% passing)
  - End-to-End: Complete pipeline validation (100% passing)
  - T15A Integration: 12/12 tests passing (all loaders verified)

## Coding Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY
- **Write tests FIRST, always** - No production code without a failing test
- **Red-Green-Refactor cycle** - Write failing test â†’ Make it pass â†’ Improve code
- **100% test-first compliance** - This is not optional, it's architectural
- **Use TDD templates** - See [TDD Templates](docs/development/standards/tdd-templates.md)
- **ðŸ“„ TDD STANDARDS**: [Test-Driven Development Standards](docs/development/standards/test-driven-development.md)

### Zero Tolerance for Shortcuts
- **NO lazy mocking/stubs/fallbacks/pseudo code** - Every implementation must be complete and functional
- **NO simplified implementations** that provide reduced functionality - Build the full feature or don't build it
- **NO hiding errors** - All errors must surface immediately with clear context
- **Fail-fast approach** - Systems must fail immediately when encountering issues rather than degrading silently
- **NO code without tests** - Tests define behavior, code implements it

### Evidence-Based Development
- **Nothing is working until proven working** - All functionality must be demonstrated with evidence
- **Every claim requires raw evidence logs** - Create Evidence.md files with actual execution logs, test results, and verification data
- **Comprehensive testing required** - Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation before claiming success
- **Performance evidence required** - Actual timing, memory usage, and resource consumption data
- **Test evidence is primary evidence** - Passing tests are the first proof of functionality

### Production Standards
- **Complete error handling** - Every function must handle all possible error conditions
- **Comprehensive logging** - All operations must be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
- **Full input validation** - All inputs must be validated against expected schemas
- **Resource management** - Proper cleanup of connections, files, and memory
- **Test coverage minimum 95%** - No merge below this threshold
