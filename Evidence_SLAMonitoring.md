- Severity-based categorization
- Both duration and error rate monitoring
- Integration with Performance Tracker

### 3. Alert System
- Pluggable alert handler architecture
- Async alert callbacks
- Violation metadata included
- Multiple handlers supported

### 4. Historical Tracking
- Violation history retention
- Filtering by operation, severity, time
- Compliance reporting
- Violation statistics

### 5. Automatic Recommendations
- Data-driven SLA recommendations
- Based on historical performance
- 20% buffer above baseline
- Minimum sample requirements

## Default SLA Configurations

### Tool Execution
```python
SLAThreshold(
    operation="tool_execution",
    max_duration=5.0,
    warning_duration=4.0,
    critical_duration=10.0,
    max_error_rate=0.05,
    min_success_rate=0.95,
    evaluation_window=100
)
```

### Database Query
```python
SLAThreshold(
    operation="database_query",
    max_duration=1.0,
    warning_duration=0.8,
    critical_duration=3.0,
    max_error_rate=0.01,
    min_success_rate=0.99,
    evaluation_window=1000
)
```

### API Request
```python
SLAThreshold(
    operation="api_request",
    max_duration=2.0,
    warning_duration=1.5,
    critical_duration=5.0,
    max_error_rate=0.02,
    min_success_rate=0.98,
    evaluation_window=500
)
```

## Test Results

### Test Suite Coverage
- **Total Tests**: 17
- **Passed**: 17 (after fixes)
- **Test Categories**:
  - Threshold validation
  - Violation detection
  - Alert handling
  - History tracking
  - Report generation

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Duration Violations**
   ```python
   # Operation takes 6s, threshold is 5s
   violation = await monitor.check_operation(
       operation="tool_execution",
       duration=6.0,
       success=True
   )
   # Result: VIOLATION severity
   ```

2. **Error Rate Violations**
   ```python
   # 10% error rate, threshold is 2%
   violation = await monitor.check_operation(
       operation="api_request",
       duration=0.5,
       success=False  # Contributes to error rate
   )
   # Result: VIOLATION for error_rate
   ```

3. **Critical Violations**
   ```python
   # Operation takes 11s, critical threshold is 10s
   violation = await monitor.check_operation(
       operation="tool_execution",
       duration=11.0,
       success=True
   )
   # Result: CRITICAL severity
   ```

## Alert System Example

```python
# Register alert handler
async def slack_alert(violation: SLAViolation):
    if violation.severity == SLASeverity.CRITICAL:
        await send_slack_message(
            f"ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SLA violation: {violation.operation} "
            f"took {violation.actual_value}s (max: {violation.threshold_value}s)"
        )

monitor.register_alert_handler(slack_alert)

# Violations automatically trigger alerts
await monitor.check_operation("api_call", 10.0, True)
# Triggers: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SLA violation: api_call took 10.0s (max: 2.0s)
```

## Compliance Reporting

### Sample SLA Report
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_operations": 5,
    "total_checks": 1000,
    "total_violations": 23,
    "critical_violations": 3,
    "violation_rate": 0.023
  },
  "operations": {
    "tool_execution": {
      "violations": 15,
      "has_sla": true,
      "sla": {
        "max_duration": 5.0,
        "max_error_rate": 0.05
      }
    },
    "database_query": {
      "violations": 8,
      "has_sla": true,
      "sla": {
        "max_duration": 1.0,
        "max_error_rate": 0.01
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Loop

The SLA Monitor includes a background monitoring loop that:
- Runs every 10 seconds
- Checks recent performance metrics
- Detects gradual degradation
- Triggers proactive alerts

```python
# Automatic monitoring example
# If average response time creeps up:
# Time 0: avg=4.5s (WARNING)
# Time 10: avg=4.8s (WARNING)
# Time 20: avg=5.2s (VIOLATION - alert triggered)
```

## SLA Recommendation Engine

### Based on Historical Data
```python
recommendation = await monitor.recommend_sla("new_operation")
# Analyzes performance history and recommends:
# - max_duration = p95 * 1.2 (20% buffer)
# - warning_duration = p95
# - critical_duration = p95 * 2.0
# - max_error_rate = current_rate * 2
```

### Example Recommendation
```
Operation: document_processing
Current p95: 25.0s
Recommended SLA:
- Warning: 25.0s
- Maximum: 30.0s (p95 + 20%)
- Critical: 50.0s (p95 * 2)
- Max Error Rate: 5%
```

## Integration with Performance Tracker

```python
# Seamless integration
tracker = PerformanceTracker()
monitor = SLAMonitor(performance_tracker=tracker)

# Performance tracked automatically
timer_id = await tracker.start_operation("api_call")
response = await make_api_call()
duration = await tracker.end_operation(timer_id, success=True)

# SLA checked against historical data
violation = await monitor.check_operation("api_call", duration, True)
# Uses tracker's error rate statistics
```

## Production Benefits

   - Gradual degradation detection
   - Predictive alerting

2. **Compliance Assurance**
   - Documented SLA adherence
   - Audit trail of violations
